And when it comes to experiences, all the other gourmands of the world and I, think about one thing: Food!Food, or, it’s better to say, experiencing new tastes is often the main motivation to travel for many people, and this is actually what we call gastro tourism. If we go further to discover the term, according to the Travel Industry Dictionary, gastro tourism is the “Recreational travel undertaken solely or primarily to experience the food and wine of a region”. People, wine is included.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Gastro TourismWhy ArmeniaLong HistoryCultureDiversity of TastesHealthy ProductsArmenian National Dishes You Should TryDolma – Meat-Stuffed VegetablesKhash – Winter SoupKhorovats – the Armenian BarbecueZhengyalov Hats – Bread with 25 Types of GreensGata – Record Holder Armenian SweetGhapama – Stuffed PumpkinLavashMatsun – Armenian YogurtHarissa – Armenian PorridgeIshkhan – Armenian FishWineFood-Related FestivalsWhy ArmeniaYou may not find Armenia among top food tourism destinations like Italy, Japan, and Australia but I think it makes the visit even more exciting. Don’t you want to discover the undiscovered? The country that straddles Europe and Asia has culinary traditions, amazing taste, and huge diversity you don’t want to miss.What makes Armenian gastronomic traditions so special and the dishes so delicious? Let’s find out.Long HistoryCulinary tradition is like wine, the older it is, the deeper it tastes. Here Armenia can compete with any other country of the world with a history dating back to 4000 BC. Furthermore, the ruins of the world’s oldest winery, Areni-1 was found within Armenia.CultureCulinary tradition is an inseparable part of the culture, especially in Armenia. Here people are known for being hospitable to everyone, even to complete strangers. Go to any village of Armenia without a penny and you’ll find people surrounding you offering for you to be their guest. And being the guest of an Armenian means eating the best of the dishes, drinking the best wine accompanied by countless toasts. Your hosts will most likely insist on you staying for the night and a nice breakfast will be added to your adventure which may include homemade matsun (a type of yogourt we are going to speak about), cheese, lavash (Armenian bread), and, of course, tea from the herbs of our mountains.Diversity of TastesThe country is situated in the northeast of the Armenian Highlands and is one of the 35 biodiversity hotspots of the world, it means the fauna and flora of this small country are really rich. This is one of the secrets of our awe-inspiring cuisine. Hardly anywhere else in the world can such a variety of herbs, greens, and vegetables be found.Being so high in the mountains, the country has all 4 seasons of the year expressed very distinctly. The extreme temperature difference of hot summers and freezing winters gives Armenian fruits, vegetables, and herbs nice and extraordinary flavor.Healthy ProductsArmenian cuisine relies heavily on meat, but all the ingredients used to cook meals are healthy, right from our valleys and mountains. Here, in Armenia, you don’t have to go to special bio-markets and pay a lot to eat healthy products, you can find them anywhere.Meat-full cuisine doesn’t mean that Armenia can’t be a great destination for vegan gastro tourists. Armenians have a religious period when traditionally people don’t eat meat. Hence, you imagine that there are many vegan meals in Armenian cuisine too and some of the traditional meals that include meat, have their vegan variations.Armenian National Dishes You Should TryArmenian cuisine is very rich and there are plenty of meals you should absolutely try when you happen to be in Armenia. Here is a list of dishes you should eat, if you want to know the Armenian culinary inside out.Dolma – Meat-Stuffed VegetablesDolma is one of the most popular dishes amongst Armenians. No matter if it’s a birthday party or New Year’s Celebration, you won’t find a traditional Armenian table without this dish. There are plenty of types of Dolma with a wide range of vegetables used like tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant, onion, and peppers. However, the most common ingredients are wine leaves and cabbage. Minced beef is stuffer/rolled in the vegetable along with rice, greens, and some spices.As you can’t find all of those vegetables mentioned above in all the seasons of the year, Armenian housewives have many ways to keep the wine leaves for winter.You don’t need to lose the chance of tasting dolma if you are a vegan. The meal has a meatless variation too, called “pasus dolma”, mostly prepared for religious days when fasting and penance are required.You can enjoy a treat of dolma, both with meat and pasus in almost all Armenian Restaurants in all seasons. It may be served with some matsun or tan (drinkable matsun).Khash – Winter SoupCooking and eating Khash is probably the most ritualized part of the Armenian cuisine. The cooking process includes boiling beef shanks for hours, sometimes the whole night until the tendon falls off the bones and the water becomes a thick broth. The meal is accompanied with a lot of crushed garlic.Khash is more than a meal, it’s a whole tradition. The “season” of Khash opens in November when the weather is cold. People often go to the hillside of Aragats, the highest mountain of the republic and here you won’t see anyone eating the meal alone. Khash is a party dish. It is served with dried lavash (Armenian bread) to crumble into the soup and a piece of soft lavash may serve as a wrap. Men often drink vodka, with a lot of toasts that have a special order.Again, almost all Armenian restaurants serve this traditional meal, but this time you should make sure to plan your visit in late autumn or winter.Khorovats – the Armenian BarbecueAgain, this is the meal Armenians eat everywhere and for every occasion. We love to take some meat and go somewhere in the nature of our beautiful country to eat barbecue. And, probably, we enjoy the process of making more than eating. Every Armenian man knows how to make khorovats, so if you don’t want to go to a restaurant and like to enjoy the process of making a real Armenian khorovats than take a taxi to somewhere like Dilijan, Sevan, or Arzni and ask your driver to stay with you. He’ll surely be happy to teach you how to make khorovats.The mixture of chopped eggplant, tomato, and pepper barbecue is an inseparable part of the tradition. Of course, you don’t want to miss the opportunity to eat lavash.Zhengyalov Hats – Bread with 25 Types of GreensZhengyalov hats is a traditional bread stuffed with 25 types of greens that are grown on the hillsides of Armenia. This meal is typical of Artsakh and the region of Syunik. The name of the meal doesn’t have anything to do with a hat, in fact, “hats” means bread in Armenian. The word Zhengyal comes from Persian Jangyal, which means forest or jungle and you can surely guess why the meal got that name.Preparing zhengyalov hats gathers all the members of the family together, some of them go to gather the needed greens, others prepare the dough. No Armenian family makes the dish solely for themselves, neighbors, relatives, and even strangers passing by always have their piece of the hats.You can pay a visit to Artsakh in May if you want to participate in the annual Zhengyalov Hats Festival. There are also many specialty restaurants that serve the hats in Yerevan and other parts of the country.Gata – Record Holder Armenian SweetThere are many types of Armenian sweets, but we like gata so much that we have prepared the world’s biggest gata that weighed 386.6 kg, and, guess what? It is officially a Guinness record holder as the biggest gata of the world. I have a piece of it on my plate in the picture above.There are many variations of the sweet and most towns and regions have their own. For instance, no one can ever visit the monastery of Geghard without trying their mouthwatering gata. It’s a rather big, round sweet you won’t be able to eat alone.You can find many types of Armenian gata in any supermarket or bakery and order it at restaurants.Ghapama – Stuffed PumpkinArmenians don’t like to celebrate Halloween so much, but we definitely like pumpkin. Ghapama, another traditional Armenian meal, proves that fact. Rice, raisins, dried plums, and apricots, nuts (almonds and walnuts), ground cinnamon, honey, and some spices are stuffed into the pumpkin and it makes a very delicious meal.Ghapama, as almost all Armenian meals, is related to traditions. As you may have guessed, Armenians don’t like eating alone, and Ghapama is not an exception. Relatives and friends come together to prepare the meal and make the process a celebration. There is even a song called “Hey Jan, Ghapama”, which states that 100 people are invited to eat the meal. If you ever bother to translate the song, you’ll get the whole recipe. But, before you do, order your Ghapama in traditional restaurants, and try not to eat your fingers with it.LavashArmenians love bread… a lot of bread. We literally eat it with anything and any meal of the day: breakfast, lunch, dinner. Hence, we just couldn’t have our own type of bread.Lavash is one of the most important parts of the Armenian cuisine and is connected to many traditions as well. In all the villages of Armenia, you can find a special room where lavash is prepared in special stoves, called tonir. A tonir is a stoned or ceramic hole in the ground that has one and a half meters depth. The bottom is used for the coals to heat it and the walls are for baking. You can find some other holes near the tonir, but they are not for fire but for women to put their feet in so that they feel comfortable when making the bread.The women of the family gather to prepare hundreds of pieces of lavash. The dried bread can be kept for months. However, there are other ways to make lavash, mostly used in the cities.Your visit to Armenia, no matter it’s gastronomic or not, won’t be complete if you don’t eat lavash. You can order it in any restaurant, find in all of the supermarkets and shops, and buy from specialty bakeries, where you can even enjoy the process of baking the Armenian bread.Matsun – Armenian YogurtMatsun is the Armenian yogurt. It’s made solely from milk and has strict instructions to follow, Matsun tastes sour and can be eaten with jams to sweeten it, or with other meals like dolma. Blend it and add some water and you’ll get a refreshing drink in hot summers called “tan”.Again, you can buy matsun, sometimes even homemade in any supermarket and shop.Harissa – Armenian PorridgeHot summers are followed by freezing winters and this is when harissa comes in. It is a thick porridge made from korkot (dried or roasted cracked wheat) and fat-rich chicken or lamb meat. The porridge is a nice treat in cold weather but Armenians start long before the winter comes. Every year on the third Sunday of September, Armenians gather in Armavir district, sing patriotic songs, prepare and eat harissa. This is to commemorate the resistance of Musa Ler mountain in 1915. It’s believed that this dish was the source of energy of Armenians fighting for their lives on the mountain.Ishkhan – Armenian FishWe don’t have a sea, but we have Sevan, one of the largest freshwater high-altitude lakes in Eurasia. Sevan trout, or as we call it Ishkhan is the favorite type of fish in Armenia. Unfortunately, because of pollution, Sevan’s Ishkhan is endangered now, and it’s not allowed to caught in the lake. But if you want to try the exquisite taste of the fish, you can go the specialty fish-restaurants, where Ishkhan is produced and grilled on the spot.WineAfter eating such tasty meals, you’d want to pour everything with a well-known Armenian wine. Armenia is one of the cradles of the wine and, as mentioned above, the oldest winery was found here. Nowadays, Armenian wine is sold in any corner of the world, but if you want to taste the best, you can pay a visit to Armenian wineries like Areni, Voskevaz, Old Bridge, and others.Food-Related FestivalsArmenians love food and like celebrations, so many food-related festivals are held in Armenia. People go to special places in big groups of friends and families to celebrate and thank mother nature for all the goods it gives. Most popular festivals are Yerevan Wine Days, Khorovats Festival, Zhengyalov Hats Festival, Dolma Festival, and Harissa Festival.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/visiting-history-full-armenia/,Visiting Historic Armenia,Armenia,"The history of Armenia goes back thousands of years. Armenians were one of the first nations to adopt Christianity (around 301 AD) and since then, this nation has suffered much pain and losses because of its religious views. Yet it has never given up.ChristianityBelieve it or not, even today, citizens of this nation would choose to die rather than adopt a religion other than Christianity. Many Armenian girls would never marry a non-Christian guy, no matter how deeply they loved him. It sounds strange I know, but that’s what I noticed during my six day stay there and what proved to be correct. Nevertheless, this refers only to marriage, since Armenians make good friends with people representing any nation. Note that they are also a very hospitable people. Visit any Armenian home and you’ll be so warmly received, you just might forget a few seconds ago you were a foreigner.As you now know, Armenia is a very religious country with lots of churches.  There are many tour groups you can join to tour Armenia if you don’t want to tour on your own, but be aware that every other day you will be visiting at least one church. Those who love churches and love learning the history and stories that every piece of church stone tells, will definitely appreciate that. But if you are going to be that guy who starts complaining about the number of churches you are seeing a tour may not be your best option.Khor VirapOne of the most memorable churches is the Khor Virap which is an Armenian Apostolic Church monastery. Khor Virap is the monastery where Grigor Lusavorich, later known as Saint Gregory the Illuminator, was imprisoned for 13 years by pagan Armenian King Tiridates III for preaching Christianity. The Saint is believed to have been kept there without food. A legend says an old widow brought him bread for 13 years in a row. The monastery has been rebuilt many times but it still preserves the breath of all those centuries.As you stand in the yard of the monastery and look in front of you, you will see a very beautiful mountain which is Mount Ararat. In case you don’t know, that is the holy mountain on which the remainders of Noah’s ark were found. Currently the mountain is considered to be in Turkish territory, but for Armenians, it’s still an Armenian mountain and every Armenian hopes, better to say is sure, the mountain will one day again be theirs. The mountain is said to look more beautiful from the Armenian side than from Turkey. I confirm it looks breathtaking.Noravank MonasteryAnother very beautiful monastery is the Noravank Monastery, which is translated into English as “New Monastery.” This monastery was built in the 13th century and is one of the most unique monasteries I have ever visited. It features very narrow stone-made staircases and the entrance is a very small one, so you have to be very careful not to hit your head while entering and coming out. The monastery is presently a cultural center.Paruyr SevakI also recommend a visit to the museum of one of greatest and most loved Armenian poets, Paruyr Sevak. He died at an early age. It is claimed that he was murdered by the Soviet government (Armenia was part of the Soviet Union until establishing its independence in 1991). The museum was awesome, and if you are lucky to have an Armenian-English speaking person among you, he might translate one of the writer’s poems for you to have a broader idea of his works. His poems are simply beautiful.Lake SevanArmenia is not a sea country, so you should not think of sunbathing at the seaside. Instead, it has the blue waters of Sevan,  which Armenians wouldn’t exchange for two or even three seas. They love this lake. During cold weather, the beaches are not crowded and you will see people calmly walking along the beach or just sitting. Many people go there in the late hours and appear to be reconsidering their lives or making some very important decisions.The picture is quite different during hot weather however. The noise, the music and the loud and happy screams are annoying for a person who’s searching for some peace and isolation, but seems a complete paradise for those who want to enjoy their time to the fullest. I enjoyed it to the fullest! There are both paid and free beaches. The paid beaches usually charge more when they see you’re a foreigner. The free beaches might be the noisiest but once you’re in a foreign country, you even start loving that.ConclusionI actually never thought Armenia would be of this much interest to me, but I turned out to be so wrong. As a historical country, it captures you with its storied past, full of interesting details like a snake charmer’s pipe captures the snake and makes it dance to the music played.Although Armenia might not strike you as a particularly dangerous country to visit, it is still important to t ensure you are well covered before your visit. Travel insurance is required before any overseas travel, and Armenia is no different. You can find the right single or annual trip policies online through a variety of providers.PodcastFor more information about travel to Armenia listen to Travel to Armenia – Amateur Traveler Episode 169Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/graffiti-tour-of-buenos-aires-argentina/,"Graffiti Tour of Buenos Aires, Argentina",Argentina,"Graffiti is virtually everywhere in Buenos Aires. This is one of the first things you notice about the city. 31 years ago Buenos Aires had no graffiti problem. Of course, they also had no democracy and would have gladly exchanged one for the other. Our guide Anna from Graffitimundo explained how graffiti came to Argentina as one form of free expression after the return of democracy and the end of the dark days of military dictatorship. In Buenos Aires, it was not started by gangs but by middle-class kids who could afford 100 peso spray paint cans and who had traveled to other countries and come into contact with hip hop culture. This was easier to do around the turn of this century when the Argentine peso was trading at parity with the U.S. Dollar. I have been on graffiti tours before but was not expecting some of these differences in the Argentine graffiti and street art scene.Since the 1950s Argentina has commonly had illegal graffiti as messages were painted on community walls and repainted sometimes weekly. It was not gangs but political parties that might paint their message on your wall announcing a candidate or a platform. While this form of graffiti was theoretically illegal, even the party in power would and still do pay to share their messages around town. This made it a sort of double standard when graffiti artists and street artists were breaking the law by putting their messages on the same walls. This is another reason why Argentina has more tolerance for graffiti.Traditionally graffiti starts with signing your name on a public space. This can be as simple as a tag (one color spray paint done quickly) or can be quite complicated multicolor, three-dimensional stylized signatures often only readable to other members of the graffiti community. “Graffiti is a message to a closed community”, Anna told us. But as you can imagine, many graffiti “artists” tired of nearly signing their name again and again. Some of these then learned to draw and began creating pieces that would be more universally greeted as art, not vandalism.In Buenos Aires some of the artwork is activism. This piece shows soccer thugs as animals as a commentary on the gangs that infest the soccer culture of the area. Although the piece may have not had the desired effect when those depicted were flattered by the work.When two British ex-pats, Marina Charles & Jo Sharff, came to live in Buenos Aires in 2008, they were surprised to see some of these pieces had not only readable signatures but websites and even cell phone numbers. They started contacting these artists to learn their stories. They fell in love with this story and started the series of graffiti tours that became GraffitiMundo. Jo has since traveled on while Marina continues to run the company. Her new business partner Jonny Robson has been creating a soon to be released documentary on the Buenos Aires graffiti scene called  “White Walls Say Nothing”. GraffitiMundo now also includes a gallery where they sell smaller pieces by artists. While I was very impressed with the street art, the current exhibit at the gallery did not grab me.Street artist Pedro PerelmanArgentina had muralists well before the graffiti scene visited the city and art for the community on community spaces is drawing artists from all of the world to come to Buenos Aires. With the most recent downturn in the economy, even some commercial artists have contributed artwork in public spaces as part of a project to “take back the city”. We happened to be driving under one of the city’s underpasses while one artist Pedro Perelman and a crew were decorating it.Benito Quinquela Martínpeople from the neighborhoodAnother very notable piece was the “world’s largest” mural which was dedicated to the art of Benito Martin whose artwork found its roots in La Boca in Buenos Aires. This project spilled over to nearby factories now decorated with the faces of local factory workers or even with passers-by.If you have a half-day, the GraffitiMundo is a fantastic way to learn more about this ubiquitous form of artwork in Buenos Aires. I highly recommend it and want to thank the Buenos Aires tourism board for arranging my tour.See my photos from the GrafiffiMundo tour. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/review-hotel-vitrum-buenos-aires-argentina/,"Review – Hotel Vitrum – Buenos Aires, Argentina",Argentina,"When the Tourism Board for Buenos Aires offered me a stay at the Vitrum Hotel in the popular neighborhood of Palermo I though they were being very nice, but after the stay I think perhaps they were just showing off. Buenos Aires is an easy city to love and this hotel sure didn’t hurt.The hotel is located in the tree lined streets of Palermo and just a few blocks from a number of great cafes that spill out into the streets. Vitrum itself boasts a sushi cafe, but nearby eateries also included pizza, pasta, platters of Argentina grilled beef, a 1950s themed American-style hamburger join and at least one Irish pub.The Palermo neighborhood, like many Buenos Aires neighborhoods we saw has a mixture of well-kept and posh buildings as well as buildings and sidewalks in poor repair and covered with graffiti, but the Vitrum is very clean and well-maintained. The hardwood floors in our room were kept so clean you could walk over them barefoot and your feet would stay clean. I am not sure you could always do that on my floor at home.It appears to have been recently renovated since the style of the hotel is very modern with glass walled corridors and elevator. In the remodel they uncovered some of the structural concrete pillars for a kind of reclaimed industrial look. The furnishings are also very stylish, yet quite comfortable.The communal spaces in the Vitrum were inviting. The pool is not large but is lovely. It has jets at one end for a jacuzzi effect. The nearby fitness room is well equipped. I loved the small glass enclosed outdoor seating area outside our room.Breakfast was served in the dining room in the lobby. The food was good and plentiful. I am of the opinion that the residence of Buenos Aires have a sweet tooth because of the number of pastries that included dulce de leche.The hotel was quiet during our 3 night stay with the exception of one band of partiers celebrating the Mardi Gras holiday. The great big comfortable bed was a great way to sleep off our jet lag. We stayed in a room with a sitting room, fridge and microwave. Our traveling companions stayed in a smaller room without the sitting room. Either would make a fine choice for your next stay in Buenos Aires.Internet was included with the room. Wi-fi was available throughout the hotel and had good speed which was good as we were about to get on a cruise ship with an enforced internet diet. Public computers were also available in the lobby.The Vitrum is about a mile from the nearest metro station (Palermo). A subway ride is only 5 pesos (about 50 cents US). Cabs are also plentiful and inexpensive. A cab to the ferry to Colonio or to the cruise ship terminal is about 100 pesos (around $10 US).Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/iguazu-falls-argentina/,"Iguazu Falls, Argentina – What You Need To Know Before You Go",Argentina,"I thought it would be easy. A walk through the park. Granted, it would be a walk through a park that just happens to contain one of the world’s most impressive waterfalls, but nonetheless, an easy day excursion.I was wrong. Visiting the Argentinean side of Iguazu Falls (locally called Cataratas del Iguazú) from Brazil was a hot, sweaty struggle that included several sticky mishaps and a dizzying pattern of hurry up and wait.Getting ThereI should have known the day would be rough when within minutes after stepping out of my air conditioned pousada room a rather unattractive heat rash specked across my chest and a slow drip began to trickle down my back and across my forehead. My only exertion had been a slightly inclined 5-minute walk to the local bus station, but I guess the strong sun and temperatures tipping past 100 degrees were a force to be reckoned with, even at 9 in the morning.Since I was based on the Brazilian side of the falls, I had to hop the border to enter Argentina’s Parque Nacional Iguazu. From Foz do Iguassu, the Brazilian city closest to the falls, travelers who are either too cheap to book a tour or who enjoy the challenge of mastering foreign transportation systems need to board a bus heading to Puerto Iguazu.The 45-minute journey includes a 15 minute shuffle through immigrations at the Brazil-Argentina border. If you’re planning to stay in Argentina rather than returning to Brazil the same day, you’ll need to get off at the Brazilian side and hand over your entry card. The bus will not wait for you.As we drove into Argentina, I peered out the window expectantly but was disappointed to discover very little to distinguish the Brazilian side of the river from the Argentinean one. I swapped to a local bus and 20 minutes later I was at the entrance of Iguazu Falls, separated from nature’s majesty by only a brown ticket building and a few souvenir shops.And a complete lack of local currency.Poor PreparationWho’d have thought a major tourist attraction located only miles from two international borders (Iguazu Falls sits where Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina meet) would only accept Argentina pesos, while in other Latin America countries, like Peru, they’re happy to accept US dollars throughout the entire country? I had plenty of Brazilian money in addition to US dollars, but both were now worthless to me.After cursing the Lonely Planet for failing to mention this extremely relevant fact, I pitifully wandered around the entrance gate, trying to pawn off my shunned currencies. I worked myself up into a sweaty panic before finally succeeding with a sympathetic snack shop worker willing to exchange my Brazilian reais for pesos if I purchased a bottle of water. Crisis averted but stress level increased.Onwards to the park! Well, at least onwards to a long line. I didn’t realize that in Parque Nacional Iguazu you can’t walk everywhere. Rather, there is a tourist train that at first seems charming (but quickly becomes annoying) that transports you from the entrance into the heart of the park, and then onto the park’s main attraction, Devil’s Throat. My plans of dashing along all the trails and pushing past fanny-packed flip-flopped tourists were dashed. Instead I found myself impatiently stuck in a cattle corral of scantily-clad visitors waiting to board a train that reminded me of the children’s attraction at my local zoo.The FallsBut of course, the payoff was worth it. Devil’s Throat (Garganta del Diablo) is located at the end of a narrow metal walkway suspended above the wide and primarily tranquil Iguazu River. The path configuration encourages a single-file trudge, which can be frustrating but actually helps build anticipation.As I progressed, the puff of water vapor became thicker and the growl of water plunging 670 feet turned into a roar. The platform opened enough to allow jostling and dizzying views. Without our orderly imposed lines, the slippery metal walkway turned into seething mass of photography-hungry warriors, each fighting for picture perfect placement.Though the vapor provided refuge from the heat, it also obscured visibility, threatened traction, and slipped things right out my fingers. Like my camera case, which after tumbling to my feet and being kicked to the ledge, hovered precariously between life as its intended purpose (protecting my camera) and falling to a watery grave. Luckily, a quick dive between a German tourist’s legs left me with scraped knees, but also the case.By now it was already midday. Another toe-tapping wait for the tourist train and crowded ride back to the center of the park preceded a panting hike along to the lower circuit toward San Martin Island.  A free boat runs to and from the island until 3:00 p.m. and I was determined to make it.  I plowed along the dirt paths and up and down steep stairs, working myself up to a ridiculous red-faced fury.Hot, Hot, HotTo reach the boat entrance I had to pass a small medical station. Here other strawberry-faced patrons had already succumbed to the heat. They sat in plastic chairs surrounded by concerned family members, flopped again a stone wall blessed with a sliver of shade, and one woman seeming to suffer from extreme heat stroke was whisked away in a wheelchair.I puffed past the tropical make-shift infirmary and down a series of narrow stone steps, excited I’d made it there a full hour ahead of the boat cut-off time. But my eager grin melted when a park ranger barred my path with a cross-armed stance and stony shake of his head. Despite the official time posting, he informed me the boats weren’t accepting more passengers, and I had to turn back.Curse you, Latin America time!I trudged back to the staircase, which now seemed insurmountable. As I passed multitudes of those suffering from heat exhaustion, the landscape around me turned fuzzy. Bursts of light speckled my vision. Breathing became difficult and I staggered my way over to the pathetic-looking huddle of others taken in by the heat. I clung to the cool rock as if my life depended on it—and during that moment of weakness I was convinced it did. When the flashes that existed only in my mind receded, I took a sip of warm water from the small bottle I’d purchased at the entrance. It was my single liquid lifeline – I couldn’t afford another 5 dollar bottle of water (though oddly the stores within the park did, indeed, accept multiple types of foreign currency).Attitude AdjustmentA sweaty mess of exhaustion and disappointment, my body yelled at me for pushing through the sweltering heat while my mind cursed me for poor planning. My common sense, however, told me to get over it quickly and enjoy the rest of the park, which, despite my candid tale so far, is truly a remarkable place.I suppose it’s relevant to note I’m not a newbie traveler. I’ve ridden on chicken buses, trekked in Peru, dined on suspect meals, and sweated it out sketchy topical towns. In other words, I’m not a tame tourist. Yet Iguauz managed to get the get the best of me. I was unprepared for the costs, complexities, heat, and crowds. Visiting on my first full day in Brazil was probably a bad idea also, and my sensitive northern body rebelled against the climate shock.I finished the day by following the Upper Circuit, which provides great views from the top of the falls. The open air here was cooling and the pathways far less crowded. No train trips were required.Next TimeI don’t want to discourage anyone from visiting Iguauz Falls. In fact, I highly encourage it, even though it is isolated along the border of Argentina and Brazil far from other travel attractions and a struggle to get to. I just want other backpackers to avoid the mistakes I made. Don’t assume that because it’s a major tourism hub—rather than an off-the-beaten-path location that only the elite travel blogging community knows about—that it will be easy. Come with a traveler’s, not a tourist’s, mindset and you’ll fare much better than I.If You Go: If you’re not dissuaded by my travel mishaps, you can visit Iguazu Falls in Argentina by booking things yourself or by traveling with a tour company. If you’re a backpacker, be sure to check out the park’s official website before you travel or if you prefer not to leave things to chance, consider booking a tour package through a South America travel company. Many agencies specialize in multiple destinations, which is helpful since Iguazu tours are almost always combined with another Brazil or Argentina destination.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/see-and-do-in-austria/,9 Places to Go in Austria,Austria,"Austria is often overshadowed by its larger neighbors but holds a certain appeal as a quintessentially European travel destination. The glorious cities of Vienna and Salzburg contrast nicely with friendly little towns and farming communities. One can go skiing or hiking in the Tirol or simply meander pointlessly through the country’s many wine regions. Let me fill you in on a budget traveler’s Austria.InnsbruckThe hostels of Innsbruck aren’t up to much, in fact, they’re mostly terrible, but with premier skiing on its doorstep and a lively atmosphere, it’s lots of fun. During the warmer months, the tourism board organizes free guided hikes which include boots and bus transport from town to the mountains. Yes, free transport, equipment, and a guided day-trip in the Alps. This is a dream for budget travelers. Do bring some cash though to buy a drink or some hot food in the mountain houses.Listen to the Amateur Traveler episode on Travel to the Tyrol (Tirol) Region of Austria.SalzburgA little north is Salzburg, most noted as a setting for the Sound of Music, but Mozart also plays an important part in the cultural attraction. There are some cool independent hostels here and one great (or terrible?) hostel, the Yoho International Youth Hostel,  plays that film every evening 365 days a year.There’s enough to capture your heart just walking around the town but you might want to splash out on a visit to the fortress which dominates the skyline. Like most Kiwis, these hulking masses of stone hold both a romantic attraction as well as an amazing quality when one thinks of how they were built and how long they have stood.Listen to the Amateur Traveler episode on Travel to Salzburg, Austria LinzLinz isn’t too impressive. Despite being 2009’s European City of Culture, a day trip can easily cover it. Highlights include the Ars Electronica Centre which is a must for any geek. Everything’s hands-on: new media technology and interfaces spring up everywhere. Amongst more traditional displays are plenty of games and other entertainments.If the weather’s good you can catch a tram up the Postlingberg to look out as far as the Alps or head back 150 years of entertainment and visit the Grottenbahn where mechanical dwarfs loom from the rock.GrazIf you like jazz, Graz (pronounced something like “Gratz”) is a good place to drop by. Add some fantastic new architecture along the river-front to the old narrow streets and there’s something lovely about it. Budget airlines make prominent use of Graz airport so if you land here don’t skip by…stop a couple of days, visit the “friendly alien” and consider heading south into the nearby wine and spa regions of Styria. Be warned: many tourists get off the train a stop early on their way to the airport. You want the “flughafen” stop!ViennaThe cities of Austria are crowned by Vienna, home of too much architecture and too many good museums. There is too much to do in one day so consider a 3-day itinerary in Vienna. Guidebook travelers run the risk of severe museum-overuse syndrome. For this, the MuseumsQuartier at the bottom of Mariahilferstrasse is the place. This neighborhood includes 8 museums from art museums to a children’s museum.Many good hostels abound at the top end of the street near the Westbahnhof, which is the main international train station. My advice? Buy a 24-hour “Vienna ticket” for a couple of euros and get a free tour around the city on one of the city’s circle trams.Then, on a fine day, buy a picnic lunch and head to the Schloss Schönbrunn. I’ve never been inside the palace, but wandering the gardens and picnicking on the grass overlooking all of Vienna is fantastic. For a couple of euros, you can try your hand at the maze and the labyrinth, which has water and audio challenges and a great playground!Listen to the Amateur Traveler episode on Travel to Vienna, AustriaGet Out of the CityTraveling through Austria at the moment seems like a life-sized art experiment. Spring rains followed by unseasonable sunshine and heat have brought a deep vibrancy to the trees: greens, browns, and yellows sit sharply against each other, especially contrasted with the occasional tree covered in pastel-pink blooms. Lush green fields are interspersed with light-brown patches of dirt where finances or crop management have stopped farmers planting. Every now and again, however, one comes across a field of rapeseed, looking like God decided to draw highlighter-yellow lines across creation.Easy transport connections and cheap hostels mean most budget travelers are drawn from city to city but, like most of Europe, the “Europe we came to see” is in the towns.MostviertelThe Mostviertel is a delightful district in Lower Austria (Confusingly, Lower Austria is the area surrounding and to the west of Vienna). Sonntagberg dominates the region with its church being the site of a yearly pilgrimage and market. Named for “most”, a bitter local cider, the farming communities, and industry of the region make for nice walks and towns.WaidhofenWaidhofen is the place to base yourself for the exhibition; a cute little town with nice cafes and restaurants, it’s been given a comprehensive makeover giving it a modern, arty feel. Linda and I were lucky enough to be there for Waidhofen’s annual night market, see a short slideshow/video here.StyriaStyria, the area south of Graz, suffers from the lack of fast, regular transport between towns but the effort of traveling is often well rewarded since this is a premier wine and spa region. There are several tour companies operating out of Graz, so that makes a good base to explore from…but do try and stay out of the city for a bit!One of the few places I’ve been lucky enough to spend time in is the area around Bad Tatzmannsdorf. It’s a “wellness” town with accommodation options from campsites to five-star resorts, all based around the natural springs. It also has an interesting outdoor museum and wonderful ice creams!Neusiedl am SeeOne thing I miss in Europe is the beach. Neusiedl am See is a popular summer town on the bank of a large lake. Wine is a big part of Neusiedl am See. One of the local high schools offers a winemaking class and there are several vinoteks and heurigers with great local fare. Boats and cycles are available for hire and the cycle tracks are amazing — taking you through farmland, wetlands, and waterfront…or, from winery to winery.There are plenty of other cool, relaxed places which I haven’t mentioned. Leave a comment below to let us know your favorite out-of-the-way spot.Getting into AustriaTrains are frequent from all local countries, best to check oebb.at for current schedules. If you’re coming from Cesky Krumlov, we’ve found the shuttle bus to Linz affordable (500kr) and a great time-saver.Budget airlines fly from many centers into Salzburg, Graz, Linz, and Bratislava. Bratislava? Yes, they fly into Bratislava and you can catch a train or shuttle bus from there to Vienna. Make sure you check your tickets; some people have been surprised!Getting around AustriaTaxis and buses are cheap enough, but trains are the most convenient way from town to town. They are run by ÖBB (oebb.at) and their red logo is easily recognizable. Many large stations have staff (although your chances of finding an English speaker is 50/50) as well as red touch-screen ticket machines. We’ve found these to be the easiest way to buy tickets – just hit the “English” button first, choose your destination and amount of people then feed in some money. If there are no ways to pay at the station, just board the train and pay for your ticket onboard. It’s about 10% more expensive, but from some rural stations, there isn’t another option.Under 26? €19 will get you a Vorteilscard which gives you a 45% discount on every train journey for a year. If you’re spending a fair bit of time there or traveling across the country, buy one as soon as you enter the country and you’ll save a ton.If you’re over 26 a Vorteilscard will give you the same discount, but set you back €99. Vorteilscards are available from any manned station; have some photo ID and a passport-sized photo available. When we caught the train from Venice to Vienna we bought our Italian ticket to the first major Austrian town, disembarked, bought a Vorteilscard and caught the next train…we almost made the cost back on that trip alone!If you’re not in the country long enough to warrant a Vorteilscard, simply traveling with a friend will save you some cash. You get more of a discount the more people are travelling together, and the ubiquitous ticket machines automatically give it to you.Getting out of AustriaGraz airport is small and seldom crowded — they also have free internet terminals to help pass the time and expensive wifi if you’re that way inclined. The wine selection after security is small but reasonable. The only other “Austrian” airport I’ve flown into is Bratislava, which is small but efficient.Why don’t you jump in a shuttle from Linz to Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic or head west into Liechtenstein then Switzerland? Germany’s always an option or skip through Slovenia to the Croatian beaches or head into Slovakia or Hungary…There are so many options only a few euros’ train ride away. Enjoy! Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/panama-canal-trip-journal/,Panama Canal Trip Journal,Aruba,"This journal covers a cruise to Panama on Holland America through Insight / Geek Cruises. The cruise was a Shakespeare cruise done in conjunction with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and a Mac cruise done in conjunction with MacWorld.Friday November 2, San Jose to FloridaThe alarm goes off very early when you are trying to be at the airport before 6am for a 6:50am flight. A close friend Brad volunteered to take us to the airport… a very close friend indeed. Although in reality it was his wife Janice who actually woke up when their alarm went off so very early in the morning.Our flights to Atlanta and then on to Fort Lauderdale were both happily uneventful and we used the time to sleep, read magazines ( I brought 2-3 inches of my backlog for this leg of the trip), or do homework (Joan). We took a shuttle ($15 a person) to the Westin Fort Lauderdale where I was surprised to find that I had apparently reserved a suite.Almost immediately after our arrival we went to a party put on by the Shakespeare at Sea / Insight Cruises program that we were joining for this trip. By the time that the evening was done we had met more people on this cruise without setting foot on the boat than we had in a week at sea on our previous cruise. Most of the crowd was older than us, some by a margin. They also were more regular or more recent patrons of the Oregon Shakespeare festival than Joan and I. I had gone to Ashland, where OSF resides, in 2006 with our kids and their high school drama group but we had not been to the festival for a few years before that. Before the birth of our kids Joan and I had gone more regularly. I had gone to Ashland with a group from my high school 4 years in a row in the 1970s. The vast majority of the people at the party were from the west coast and the majority were from the San Francisco bay area. We very quickly found interesting people to talk to. We even found some Mac people who ventured in from the Mac party and some others like myself who were fans of both Mac and Shakespeare.Before going to bed I recorded a new introduction to an old episode of the Amateur Traveler podcast for publication on November 10th.Saturday November 3, Leaving Fort LauderdaleThe ship was scheduled to leave port at 5 pm which gave us plenty of time. We slept in, booked a place on the Holland America shuttle bus ($12 a person), brought our luggage to the truck and then went to brunch. We still had time to kill before the buses started to leave at 12:30 pm so we tried to get the last little bits of email etc off the internet before we had to pay $25 an hour to connect.We met more people while we waited for a tour of the ship. Our biggest fear was that our tour guide had gotten lost. Finally Colby, one of the assistant cruise directors, showed up and led us from bow to stern, from the dining room to the theatre, and much of what was in between. We had been on one similar cruise before on Royal Caribbean on the Empress of the Seas. This cruise was on Holland America’s Volendam. The Empress carried around 1,000 passengers and the Volendam 1,400. Much of the two ships were the same. The dining room and theatre were very similar. The central atrium on the Volendam was in the range from uninspiring to ugly and garish. The Volendam has a small theatre in addition to the large theatre which is used for movies, talks and cooking classes as it has a demonstration kitchen behind the screen. The Empress had a small but nice library hidden away where you could exchange one of the books you had brought on board for one that someone else left. The Volendam tripled the size of the library, added a coffee bar, many internet stations, a DVD library ($3 a day unless you have a suite) and a decent sized library of books available for free check out. The Volendam has the usual collection of shops, bars and a casino. It does have 3 self-serve laundries. It does not have a climbing wall or equally flashy gimmick. It has two pools, the larger pool (still small) is chlorinated and the one that is on the bow and not surrounded by a wall is salt water since the water in the pool can splash into the ocean in a rougher sea. The roof on the main pool can be closed in case of rain. The Volendam also has a buffet restaurant on the Lido deck as well as an upscale restaurant ($30 per person not counting wine).Before we left port we did a lifeboat drill where all of the passengers crowded onto 3rd deck where the lifeboats are located. Women and children are still first so the men lined up in the back and the ladies in the front. Pity the person who is claustrophobic as the ships passengers just fit on the 3rd deck. Since the lifejackets have the ship’s cabin on them, the crew checked off most people as they arrived and then just called out the names of the ones they were missing. We were assured that there were plenty of lifeboats for all the passengers.At 5 pm there was a Sail Away party on the deck in the stern of the ship. There was a live band and of course cocktails as we watched the Florida coast drift away. We waved at the Pilot boat and the people on land as we chatted with more people attending the Mac cruise including Janet from Apple’s Education department. Some of the people on the Mac cruise had the cruise paid for by their jobs, which seems to make that audience somewhat more varied in age than the Shakespeare cruise. Eventually the party was broken up by strong winds that started blowing the chairs all over the deck (predominantly the ones without anyone in them).At 7 pm the Shakespeare at Sea had a cocktail party to welcome everyone. We received our schedules, listened to welcoming remarks and met still more cruise mates.At 8 pm we adjourned to the dining room for the late seating of dinner. The plan is to shuffle the tables each night among the Shakespeare at Sea attendees so that we can meet more people. I was more impressed with my dinner than Joan, so the quality seemed to depend somewhat on what you ordered.At 10 pm Joan and I went to the evening’s movie which was Evan Almighty. Only 2 other people attended although they had prepared popcorn for more like ten times that number.Sunday November 4, Half Moon CayToday’s port of call was Half Moon Cay, which is a private island in the Bahamas owned by Holland America. We tendered into the island into a man-made harbor by the beach. The beach was a beautiful beach with fine white sand. Near the beach were bars, gift shops, an information booth, an outdoor kitchen, covered picnic areas and private cabanas. We rented a clamshell to provide shade for our chaise lounges ($10). We swam in the morning, read and napped. I tried out my underwater video camera. I thought that there were no fish in the water until I found out later that I had caught one in a video. Lunch was a BBQ on the island prepared in the outdoor kitchen. After lunch we took a cycling tour of the island. It was supposed to be a guided tour but our tour guide did not actually seem to like to talk or provide information so we were not always clear where we were going or why we had stopped here. We stopped at the horse corral, at the inner lagoon (and saw some old ruined houses), and the sting ray lagoon. The pace of the group was slow but the distances were very short. Serious bikers would probably be very frustrated with the tour.After returning to the ship we went to the large theatre where we were supposed to see a new performance put on by the OSF actors but it turns out that their costumes and props had gone missing (they later turned up in Florida) so instead Bill Rauch, the new artistic director, talked about his background and then answered questions about what his plans where for OSF. He had some very interesting experiences with a theatre company called Cornerstone, which he helped found with 14 friends right out of college. They started with a mission of bringing live theatre to small towns in the U.S. but ended up morphing into a mission of using theatre to bring communities and diverse groups together.I then went to a Mac event where Randal Shwartz talked about cool utilities for the Macintosh. I had heard of most of these utilities but still picked up some interesting new ones to check out when I get home.At dinner we met still more Californians in the Shakespeare group and talked about Shakespeare, audio books, web sites (one of the group owns LovePoems.com) and travel.The evening’s entertainment was Michael James who juggled, rode a unicycle, heckled the audience and climbed an 8 foot ladder which was free standing. The audience was a bit surprised when he really rode the unicycle with a member of the audience on his shoulders. We were probably even more surprised that she went along with it.Monday November 5, At SeaOur morning started with a lecture on violence in Shakespeare from Christopher Duval. He talked about the weapons (rapier) and styles of combat in Shakespeare’s day. He also said one census from the time had 130 men for every 100 women which caused great sexual tensions which are played out in Romeo and Juliet.The next talk was again with Bill Rauch talking about the 2008 OSF season. Joan attended but I worked out in the gym instead. It is surprising that on a ship of 1400 people it is not hard to find a free machine in the gym. They had maybe 20 aerobic machines of which no more than 10 were in use at any given time.After lunch I attended a question and answer session with 4 of the actors, which Joan skipped so she could work out. The stories the actors told often left us in stitches. My favorite was a story of a production of Julius Caesar (not at OSF) where just after Caesar was killed in a very dramatic fashion with lots of stage blood, the assassins paused to let the audience take in the moment. In the silence a phone started ringing off stage. No one knew what to do until one of the actor’s ad libbed “what if it is for Caesar?”The second session was watching the film Romeo and Juliet from 1968 by Franco Zefferelli. Barry Kraft gave some introductory remarks about what to watch for in this particular production. The theatre was warm and more than one head nodded off when the lights went out. It was a good production but I was not the only one hoping that just this once it would not end so badly for our star crossed lovers.I stayed in the same theatre for another 2 hours to hear Jason Snell of MacWorld give a presentation on Leopard 101 (Mac OS 10.5). I knew much of what he was presenting but there was enough that I did not know to make the presentation (which was well done) worthwhile.Dinner was our first of 3 formal dinner evenings, so I rushed quickly from the Mac talk to the room to change and then on to the dining room. Yet again we had wonderful dinner table mates. We can’t join in the discussions on the most recent OSF productions, but also found may other things to talk about. Our table had 2 doctors and their wives (a hand surgeon at Shriner’s hospital in LA and a Ob/Gyn from Bellevue Washington). They each had a couple of stories of being asked “is there a doctor in the house… or on the plane…Tuesday November 6, at ArubaOur ship was not scheduled to arrive in Aruba until noon so I attended Robin Williams’ (not that one) class Fourth Wall? What Fourth Wall? The Elizabethan Stage. Robin showed pictures of the old globe and the new globe in London and talked about how actors in the New Globe gained new insights about Shakespeare’s plays when they performed those plays on a stage similar to that which he used. Particularly it became clear how many speeches were aimed at the groundlings who stood at the very edge of the stage. She also introduced us to the Wheel of Fortune and the Great Chain of Being and we learned the proper use of thee/thou vs you in Elizabethan English.After that I went to a session on podcasting by Randal Schwartz on the Macmania track. I can only hope that my comments were helpful as I did not go as much to learn as to share.For our shore excursion we did a sea kayaking and snorkeling trip. We had 3 very nice guides who showed us how to paddle and un-capsize a kayak (fortunately the second set of knowledge went unused). We had never kayaked before but had wanted to try it. We did not steer anything like a straight course but did manage to get to and from a park down the coast which we used as a base for snorkeling. I had brought my prescription swim goggles so I went out without a mask and snorkel which made the snorkel part of the excursion more work. There was not really great visibility but at least I was able to start getting the hang of the underwater video camera (Sanyo Xacti) that I had recently purchased. The guides made us wear life vests which just got in the way. Mine kept coming unzipped which just gave me one more thing to fuss with. We were warned by the guides that fire coral which was prevalent in the area would give us a painful and permanent tattoo should we touch it.After the excursion we walked around the port area of Aruba but only had to venture a block or so before the city started looking pretty seedy.Wednesday November 7, at CuraçaoWe had booked a cruise and snorkel excursion through http://ShoreTrips.com for Curaçao. Since we were not booking through the cruise line we were the only people from our ship on the excursion and had to wait by the port’s gate for almost a half hour after the time they had given us before the van picked us up. The van took us to Spanish Bay, which was a distance away. Unlike Aruba, much of Curaçao looked attractive and I would like to spend more time there some time. At Spanish Bay we took a Zodiac out to the sailing schooner Bounty. The ship had about 40 passengers and a crew of 5. We motored out of the bay and then raised the two jibs to sail to our first snorkel destination. There was a free open bar on the boat so I got my diet coke fix and a rum punch or two during our 5 hour voyage. The visibility was better at Curaçao than we had seen at Aruba and both the outing before and after lunch were quite fun (so fun that I did not notice how fried my back was getting in the tropical sun). After a nice lunch on the boat we motored a short distance to the wreck of a tug boat. I was able to shoot underwater video that reminded me of the Titanic. All in all it was an excellent outing which left me grinning profusely and fried to a crisp.Thursday November 8, at SeaFriday November 9, Panama CanalWe arose early (thankful for gaining an hour in the time change as we sailed West to Panama and Eastern Time) to watch the ship enter the 3 locks that took the ship up the 85 feet from sea level to the level of Gatun Lake. The canal has 6 sets of locks total but the ship just went up halfway and then back down again to the Caribbean. We left the ship in Gatun Lake for a 7 hour adventure across Panama by bus to a ferry on which we rode out the 3 remaining locks to the Pacific ocean. Being in the lock in a small boat is a different perspective from the big cruise ship. The canal seemed surprisingly small to me. We saw where they are starting the new expanded canal, which will allow the canal to carry larger ships. I was also surprised at the Gaillard Cut how small the cut looked. It is hard to believe that 20,000 people died in the French effort at this spot alone (of the 22,000 deaths). The area around the canal looks more pastoral than jungle these days. We had rain on our trip, which is not that surprising in an area that gets 250 inches of rain a year. We had a good local guide whose English we usually able to make out. Although when he said we were moving towards our “destiny” (when he meant “destination”) that sounded pretty ominous.Saturday November 10, Costa RicaWe had another early start (and to our surprise another time change to Central Time) in Costa Rica. Both at Panama and Costa Rica large numbers of passengers were doing shore excursions so we were gathered in the Frans Hals lounge (the largest theatre) where we were each tagged with a colored number sticker by tour group. With the rest of the red #7s we boarded a bus with a very articulate local guide. We transferred from the bus to a train for a ride through the rain forest and banana plantations. Living up to the name rain forest, it rained our entire day in Costa Rica. At times it rained quite hard. Our guide told us that the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica has two seasons: the rainy season and the rainier season. Some of our bus/train/ship mates still grumbled about the rain. We stopped at a banana packing plant but for some reason they were not working that day. They normally work every day and our guides were caught by surprise. Our bus driver works at one of these plants and is part of a program where he trained to be a driver and drives a couple of days a week. We learned that a banana plant will bear one and only one bunch of bananas (in about a year) and then will be chopped down. So they leave two younger plants growing from the same root system so that the same root system can bear 3 bunches of bananas in a year.After our train ride we stopped for a break with music, shopping, fresh fruit and fruit juice or beer (Imperial from Costa Rica) before boarding a boat where we cruised a short distance along the rain forest. We saw a sloth (curled in a ball against the rain) and several different types of birds: toucans, egrets, etc. We also saw small bats, which we would easily have missed if not for the sharp eyes of our boat driver.Sunday November 11, At SeaMonday November 12, At SeaI podcast about this trip at the Amateur Traveler podcast in these podcasts:Amateur Traveler Episode 113 – Theme Cruise to Panama (Shakespeare at Sea / MacMania)Amateur Traveler Video Episode 25 – Curaçao – Sailing and Snorkeling with the Bounty (part 1)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/remembering-100-years-since-wwi-flanders-field/,Remembering 100 Years Since WWI in Flanders Field,Belgium,"Seeing my last name, Christensen, on one of the smooth white marble headstones gave me pause. Walking through the American Cemetery at Flanders Field, I was not expecting to discover some long lost cousin. Not too many feet away I saw the name Todd, my wife’s maiden name, marking the grave of a young man from her home state of New York. In that moment, WWI seemed not quite as distant.James T Christensen – Flanders Field American Cemetary2014 marked 100 years since an assassin’s bullet in Sarajevo started a series of events that sent the world to war and 2018 marks 100 years since the last shot was fired. For the people of Belgium and the region of Flanders in particular, the Great War, the War to End All Wars, is fresher in their memories. Last year the Belgium army’s well-practiced practiced bomb disposal unit collected 105 tons of unexploded shells from fields and construction sites around the country. Even today, about a dozen times a year a soldier’s body is found. Only two months ago the bodies of 3 South African soldiers were discovered and reinterred with their comrades in one of the 150 Commonwealth cemeteries maintained within a few miles of the Belgium city of Ieper (Ypres).In Belgium, the German advance towards Paris was finally halted here at Iepor where the war ground into the standstill of trench warfare. They were stopped in part because the Belgian King Leopold I opened the floodgates to flood the lowlands in front of the oncoming army. By doing so he saved a small piece of Belgium from German occupation. In all, nearly 500,000 soldiers from 50 nations died within a few miles of Ieper.The newly renovated and expanded Flanders Field Museum at Ieper does a wonderful job teaching the history of WWI in Belgium. One video reenacts, for instance, the thinking of the Germans as they plan the first gas attack the war and the reaction of the Canadian soldiers who endured it. Another video puts voice to a British soldier explaining the Christmas Truce of 1914 when for one day the soldiers laid down their guns, met in no man’s land and sang Christmas carols together with the enemy.Flanders Field MuseumAlso in Ieper is the Menin Gate which was built to commemorate 55,000 missing Commonwealth soldiers. Well into its construction it was discovered the number of missing was, in fact, closer to 90,000. A second wall was built at the nearby Tyne Cot Cemetery to hold the overflow of names.Each night at 8 pm Ieper holds a Last Post ceremony at the Menin Gate. 4 buglers in greatcoats play “Last Post” before the hushed crowd, followed by a minute of silence. Visitors in the crowd who have arranged ahead with the Last Post Association then lay wreaths at the memorial. Many of the wreaths are silk red poppies with black centers in remembrance of the poem “In Flanders Fields” by John McCrae. “In Flanders fields, the poppies blow. Between the crosses, row on row…”Last Post at the Menin GateOn July 9, 2015, observed the 30,000th time they have held the Last Post ceremony. The ceremony started shortly after WWI. They did pause the ceremony during the WWII occupation by Germany but started again one hour after the German troops retreated from the city. What started as a ceremony for locals and the occasional visiting veteran now draws an average of 600 people each night, and many more on special days like Remembrance Day (November 11).Belgium had a number of new events planned to commemorate the 100th anniversary of WWI from 2014-2018. In April of 2014, for instance, they lined the route of the trenches from the English Channel to the French Border with lights, with people holding torches. On Christmas in 2014 they commemorated the Christmas Truce. Expect some of the largest events to be held each November 11th to commemorate the armistice which began at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.Last Post at the Menin GateWalking around the smaller American cemetery it was surprising how many soldiers died in the last days, or even the last minutes of the war. The last soldier to be killed was an American. Henry Gunter was killed one minute before the cease-fire took hold because someone gave the rather pointless order to capture a German machine gun position. The German soldiers first tried to wave off the advancing Americans to get them to stop, apparently seeing no point in one more meaningless death.Perhaps that is the lesson to be learned from WWI. It was a war that shredded many of the glorious pictures of war and replaced them with muddy trenches, poison gas, cratered landscapes, and wholesale death. It also laid the foundation for all that followed after in the 20th century.Soldier at Tyne Cot CemetaryTourists who visit the beautiful nearby cities of Bruges, Antwerp, Ghent or Brussels should consider adding a visit to Flanders Fields.more photos from Iepermore photos from Flanders Field U.S. CemeteryShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/memorial-museum-passchendaele-1917-zonnebeke-belgium/,"Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 – Zonnebeke, Belgium",Belgium,"Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 in Zonnebeke, Belgium The Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 in Zonnebeke recalls the horrors of a battle during the First World War that was called “The Pointless Bloodbath”In London on June 7th, 1917, British Prime Minister Lloyd George – as well as many other people – heard an explosion. In Lille, France, scientists recorded what they thought was an earthquake. In fact, the largest man-made explosion until the birth of the nuclear bomb had occurred. It was when the British Army detonated 19 mines in Messines, West Flanders, Belgium (150 miles from London!).A German observer noted: “Nineteen enormous mushrooms rose up slowly and majestically out of the ground and then split into pieces with a mighty roar, sending up multi-colored columns of flame mixed with a mass of earth and splinters high in the sky.” The explosions killed more than 10,000 German soldiers; almost the same number were left stunned and disoriented.The explosions marked an offensive that continued with the British Army launching more shells at the German Army than they did during the whole of the Battle of the Somme. It culminated in one of the bloodiest battles of the First World War – the Battle of Passchendaele.The objective of the battle was to capture the ruins of Passchendaele village. It was a nightmare mission. Torrential rain had turned the ground into a quagmire of thick, stinking mud that swallowed man and machine. Wave after wave of Allied forces were mowed down. Troops were called in from Australia and New Zealand only to perish within days. Passchendaele became known as ‘Passion-dale’ – the valley of suffering. It wasn’t until November 6th that fresh Canadian troops finally succeeded in seizing the village. Victory came at a huge cost. Five miles of ground had been won. Casualties numbered 245,000 Allied and 217,000 German soldiers.Remembering the Battle of PasschendaeleThe Battle of Passchendaele is the focus of the Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 (MMP17) in Zonnebeke, Belgium. Housed in the beautiful Zonnebeke Chateau which is located in extensive parkland, all three floors are fully utilized to display historical objects, soldiers’ letters, war documents, posters, original uniforms and all sorts of weaponry. These are supported by black-and-white movies from the war and hundreds of original photographs.A unique feature of the museum that I found really interesting is the Dugout Experience. This is a series of rather claustrophobic underground tunnels that replicates the British Army’s quarters in 1917. If you’re wondering why the army was stationed below ground – it’s because there was nothing left above-ground. Outside are faithfully reconstructed German and British trenches.As the museum is based in the middle of where the battle took place, this gives it a unique perspective. Maps, photographs, illustrations and maquettes at the museum clearly relate the key events of the battle to local landmarks. Once I looked out the window and half-expected to see a column of troops marching past.The museum also pays homage to all the different nationalities who fought in this battle, so has mini-exhibitions on the armies of Belgium, Britain, Germany, France, New Zealand, India, South Africa, Australia and Canada. ‘Building the Front’A special exhibition taking place this year at MMP17 focuses on German defensive lines built the year before the Battle of Passchendaele. In 1916 it was “All Quiet on the Western Front”, at least in Flanders. (Not so further down the front in northern France, where the Battles of Verdun and the Somme lasted virtually the whole of 1916 and led to almost two million casualties.)But in Flanders it was time to consolidate; to dig in and defend the captured land. The German Army in particular constructed elaborate defensive lines stretching along the front. Most notable of these were the Albrecht, Willem and Flandern I, II and III lines, for which they drafted in over 100,000 Belgian citizens (Zivilarbeiter) as laborers.The exhibition at the MMP17 is called ‘Building the Front’, and explains why and where these German defensive lines were built, and what materials were used for their construction. Again, the information that the museum has – sometimes quite literally – dug up is extremely impressive.You can discover how the lines took the form of long trenches fortified at regular intervals with concrete bunkers and machine-gun posts and topped with rows of barbed wire. You can see how the infantry units manning these lines were backed up by artillery massed to the rear. They look virtually impenetrable – and were. The following year, the Allies encountered enormous difficulties attempting to breach these defenses, and lost thousands of men in their attempts.Take the historical trailThe Memorial Museum Passchendaele 1917 is an excellent museum. However, I am always aware that any war museum is sanitized to some degree. The replicated trenches were fascinating, but we know that the bottoms of the actual trenches were stinky, rat-infested and flooded. The museum’s trenches were clean, with their bottoms covered with wooden boards so that visitors’ feet didn’t get muddy. Of course, with visitors – including children – passing through them, they have to be. But the consequence is that in war museums I usually feel detached from reality.If you feel the same, then I recommend that after visiting the museum you follow the specially constructed historical trail that starts from outside the museum and takes you through Polygon Wood, scene of a massacre of British and Australian troops during the Battle of Passchendaele.In these Flanders fields, you might want to stand and stare for a few moments. To consider that in fields like these, young soldiers lived and died – and might even be buried deep down below where you are standing. And then you can stroll through Polygon Wood Cemetery, and silently remember those who lost their lives during “The Pointless Bloodbath.”Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/flanders-field-revisited-thoughts-remembrance-day-flanders/,Flanders Field Revisited – My Thoughts on Remembrance Day in Flanders (Poem),Belgium,"On November 11th in 2014 I had a chance to visit the WWI graveyards in Flanders. In case you may be unaware, November 11th is Veteran’s Day for Americans and Remembrance Day for much of the rest of the English speaking world. It marks the end of WWI which ended at 11 am on the 11th day of the 11th month.150 cemeteries surround the Belgium city of Ieper. Nearly 500,000 soldiers from 50 nations died within a few miles of Ieper nearly 100 years ago from 1914-1919.Many of the graves hold wreaths or crosses with blood-red poppies on them. The poppy became associated with those who died on the fields of Flanders through the poem “In Flanders Field” by Canadian John McCrae.In Flanders Fieldby John McCraeIn Flanders fields the poppies blowBetween the crosses, row on row,That mark our place; and in the skyThe larks, still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.We are the Dead. Short days agoWe lived, felt dawn, saw sunset glow,Loved and were loved, and now we lie,In Flanders fields.Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch; be yours to hold it high.If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields.Last PostIeper, Belgium holds a nightly ceremony at the Menin gate remembering the fallen from WWI. The ceremony is held each night at the gate which was constructed to hold a list of 55,000 names of soldiers from the Commonwealth whose final resting place is unknown. The actual number grew to closer to 90,000 names so the list is continued on a memorial at nearby Tyne Cot Cemetery. 4 buglers play Last Post and then wreaths are laid at the memorial. It is a moving ceremony.I was struck with the tremendous loss of life in the conflict and yet the very marshal air of the Flanders Field poem  to “take up our quarrel with the foe”. I wondered if it might be time to update the poem a bit and so I present below “Flanders Field Revisited”, inspired by my visit.Flanders Field Revisitedby Chris ChristensenFor glory and for honor they march into the frayWith confidence, their joyous war will end by Christmas DayThey march against the boche, the frogs, the limeys, and the hunsTheir strong contempt a poor defense against the Vickers gunsWith iron shells they till the fields, with gas they stain its skyTheir bright hopes mired in Flanders mud, they live, they bleed, they dieTheir youth is ground to misery, their bravery they sowIn Flanders fields, they leave their dead in row on row on rowTheir bones cry out for options lost, the bravery of peaceTheir prayer as ours that in their name all future war shall ceaseShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/museums-belgium/,"Museums in Belgium – 4 Must See Art, Music and History Museums",Belgium,"I had a chance to go to 4 museums in Belgium that I think are must see experiences.Unfinished Painting – Ruben’s House Museum – Antwerp, BelgiumRubens House – Antwerp, Belgium The best known of these museums is the House of the artist Peter Paul Rubens. This small museum is both a gallery of his work as well as of the works of art he collected. In 1620 the town clerk wrote “His home will awaken the astonishment of strangers, the admiration of travellers.”. So it is fair to say that this house has been well known for some time. The current museum opened in 1946 and oddly enough the occupying Germans helped with the restoration of the house, since Rubens was born in Germany. The house and renaissance gardens themselves have been the subject of numerous pieces of art.In the museum you will see a number of well known and lesser known pieces by Rubens including one interesting unfinished work. Whether a pieces is “by Rubens” is an interesting thing, because Rubens employed a number of assistants and when you commissioned a piece by him you would pay more if he painted a higher percentage of the work. Once he got to be a master painter it was probably an assistant or apprentice that would paint something like a large blue sky.Belgium Red Star Line Museum (photo by by Ilona Kauremszky / mycompass.ca) Red Star Line Museum – Antwerp BelgiumThe Red Star Line Museum opened 28 September 2013 and retells the history of the two million emigrants from Europe who sailed from Antwerp to the United States and Canada from 1873 to 1934 on the Red Star Line. This museum was a bit of a surprise for me because I expected it to focus mainly on the ship journey itself but it covered a much broader perspective. Some wonderful audio visual and interactive elements tell you individual stories of specific families. The museum talks about why they left their homelands, how they traveled to Antwerp, all the examinations they underwent before departure and after arrival at Ellis Island or Castle Clinton, and how they fared in the new land.Some families were escaping the pogroms agains the Jews in Eastern Europe, some were driven to leave by bad harvests or unstable political situations. Copies of the letters their relatives sent them told them the streets were not paved with gold but there was opportunity. Some praised places like Chicago as “like Poland but better”, while others found adapting to their new land was more difficult. Families bought tickets not just on the boat but on the trains from the far reaches of Europe on one end to distance cities like Boston , Chicago, or Tacoma on the far end.Emigrants had to shower for hours, and be poked and prodded before they got on the ship to see if they would pass the physical in the U.S. Or Canada. If they failed the physical, the Red Star Line would have to pay the cost of  repatriating them to Europe so they tried to be as thorough as possible. The stories of the new immigrants dealing with the confusion of Ellis Island were particularly poignant. What would you do if your new country rejected your daughter because she was mentally deficient? What would you do if a fungal infection kept two of your children isolated on Ellis Island for months while they were treated.The museum can be quite crowded and a reservation is very highly recommended. The multimedia presentations have English dialog or subtitles but most of the signs in the museum do not. Take your time and savor this wonderful museum. Parents with children should be reminded that Europeans are a bit more comfortable with nudity and one theater just after the Ellis Islands section should be skipped if you don’t want your kids asking questions that may come from full frontal nudity. There is also a tower you can climb for a view of the busy harbor. The climb to the tower is better for exercise than for the vista.Hungarian Bagpipes – Musical Instruments Museum – Brussels, Belgium Musical Instruments Museum – Brussels, BelgiumI was disappointed with the Belgium National Art Gallery. It has a fine collection poorly presented in a dimly lit building. But, just around the corner from that museum is a gem of a museum called the Musical Instrument Museum.The building itself is an Art Nouveau treat but the collection is what makes me recommend this museum. There is a collection of instruments from all over the world on the 1st floor. You are given an audio guide when you enter the museum. The audio guide does not have any English words, but that is because it has no spoken commentary at all. Instead when you walk up to an exhibit the audio guide begins to play that instrument. To say that there are a wide variety of instruments or styles of music in this world would be an understatement. One of my favorites was a set of bagpipes from Hungary.Musical Instruments Museum – Brussels, BelgiumBut my favorite exhibit is found on two higher floors which trace the history of western music in a similar fashion. The music was often quite familiar but the instruments I were looking at took, at times, quite unfamiliar shapes. Cornets (horns) that looked like they would have been at home in Roman times were playing chamber music. There were fanciful brass instruments with 7 different trumpet-like bells that looked like they came out of Doctor Seuss. The collection of stringed instruments showed that what we now thing of as a piano-shape was less obvious to early inventors. There were pyramid shaped pianos and other fanciful configurations.This would be a wonderful museum for kids interested in music. I did find that the audio players did not always trigger right when they should and I sometimes had to take a less direct path so that the system understood when I had moved on.Christmas Truce – In Flanders Fields Museum – Ieper, BelgiumIn Flanders Fields Museum – Ieper, BelgiumIn preparation for the 100 year anniversary of WWI the Flanders Fields Museum in Ieper’s Cloth Hall was recently renovated and expanded. The museum is a great introduction to the history of WWI, especially as it was fought in Belgium, mostly around the city of Ieper. Nearly 500,000 soldiers from 50 nations died within a few miles of this medieval city.The wonderful audio visuals at this museum tell the stories of the war by putting the words into ghostly images of reenactors. So instead of just reading about the Christmas Truce, for instance, when the soldiers in 1914 spontaneously laid down their arms and met in no man’s land to sing Christmas Carols, you here a British Tommy tell the story.The museum explores the causes of the war, the path it took as it escalated. The decision of the Germans, for instance, to use poison gas for the first time and the experience of the Canadian soldiers who withstood that attack. One fascinating exhibit shows areal views of Ieper and the surrounding countryside that you can overlay with footage taken at various times during the war. You can fade from one to another as you see how Ieper, including the reconstructed Cloth Hall you are standing in was flattened in the war, and how the surrounding countryside looked more similar to the cratered landscape of the moon than it does to pastoral Flanders.This museum is a must for history buffs who may also want to take one of the local WWI history tours offered in Ieper.What is your favorite museum in Europe?Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/bulgaria-in-7-days/,Around Bulgaria in 7 Days,Bulgaria,"When it comes to Bulgaria, people know of its Eastern European heritage, its superstar gymnasts and tennis athletes, and its largest export – fragrant rose oil. However, few people know of its exact location and cultural idiosyncrasies. Tucked between Romania, Serbia, Greece, and the Black Sea, this Balkan country is home to some of the world’s oldest civilizations.Hardly any other culture in the world so aptly combines antiquity with modernity. All at once, Bulgaria has progressed toward a technologically advanced center while still maintaining the structures, ruins, and traces of the ancient civilizations that used to inhabit its diverse landscape.And diverse it is. Plains, mountains, lakes, and seas adorn its small but mighty geography. With a population of 7 million and a landscape that is traversable in just 6 hours, it’s hard to believe that one small country could contain so many multi-faceted and breathtaking sights. However, Bulgaria proves itself time and time again as a gem of the Slavic region.Despite the fact that you can cross Bulgaria in just 6 hours, it will take much longer than that to really absorb the sights. And even then, there will still be countless more sights to see. However, in just seven days, you can easily touch upon some of the most widely lauded and breathtakingly beautiful destinations within this small country.Day 1: SofiaBoth the country’s capital and a sprawling metropolis, Sofia promises not to disappoint. No matter how you’re getting into Bulgaria, chances are that Sofia is your first stop. The airport and central ground transportation hubs are all here. This city is a spectacular mix of old and new, preserving its old buildings and well-preserved Thracian ruins while still introducing new hi-tech architecture (such as the Capital Fort skyscrapers).Upon arriving in Sofia, the premier stop for many is the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral. This elegant and historic Neo-Byzantine cathedral is beautiful inside and out. One of the largest Eastern Orthodox Cathedrals in the world, it can hold up to 10,000 people inside and is a major tourist attraction.Another favorite stop is the Central Mineral Baths, appropriately located in the center of the city. This former Turkish public bath turned museum is a testament to the city’s abundance of mineral springs. The bathhouse is surrounded by hot mineral water fountains, where passersby are welcome to have a drink or even just simply soak their hands.If you’re looking to do some shopping and stock up on souvenirs, your next stop should be Vitosha Boulevard. This is the city’s main commercial street and shopping center, akin to an open-air shopping mall. It features designer stores such as Versace, D&G, Boss, and more, but also boasts smaller mom-and-pop establishments. The best part? It’s adorned with a multitude of small sidewalk cafes where you can sit, have an espresso (or Turkish coffee, a local favorite) and engage in some people-watching.Day 2: PlevenTo get to Pleven from Sofia, we highly recommend taking the train. Sure, the train cars can be a little rickety and derelict, but it’s all part of the experience, right? The train from Sofia to Pleven carries you through the Balkan Mountains, where you’ll soak up unforgettable sights. The railway is reminiscent of one traveling through the Swiss Alps, as you chug along with sky-high mountains above you and small riverside villages below you.A personal favorite village of mine for passing through is Svoge. Not only is it quaint, but it’s also the main production site of a local chocolate bar by the same name. Chocolate lovers unite!Pleven’s main attraction is its city center filled with Bulgaria’s trademark sidewalk cafes and traditional European architecture. It’s also famous for its Kaylaka, a large urban park featuring a manmade lake and numerous ponds, cafes, and restaurants – as well as a zoo. Think Central Park, but greener and far more enticing. Unlike Central Park, it features the ancient ruins of a Roman fortress. Seems like anywhere you go in Bulgaria, you’re bound to see some ruins.Day 3: Veliko TarnovoVeliko Tarnovo is about a 2-hour commute from Pleven, and perhaps one of my personal favorite destinations. This city is located on the Yantra River, with its unique and historic houses and buildings rising above and overlooking it for a spectacular Riviera-like sight. Its winding cobblestone roads, cozy gift shops, and bustling streets filled with vendors make you feel right at home in this traditional European town.The city is often referred to as the “City of Tsars” for being home to Kings during the Second Bulgarian Empire. One of its most spectacular landmarks is Tsarevets, a medieval fortress located atop a hill overlooking the city. If you’re willing to climb the thousands of steps and whip yourself into shape after indulging in the country’s local cuisine of rakia (fruit brandy) and banitsa (a guilt-inducing greasy phyllo pastry), the trek is totally worth it.Day 4: Black Sea Coast – Balchik & NessebarYou must have known the Black Sea Coast would be a mandatory stop on the list. The sea is most beautiful in Bulgaria – white sands, warm water, and remarkable hotels. Start in Balchik at the northernmost point and explore the Balchik Palace. Overlooking the sea, this palace was once home to Queen Marie of Romania and consists of a botanical garden, a holy spring, a monastery, and a chapel.From the rocky shores of beautiful Balchik, you can travel down to the Southern coast, where you’ll collide with the town of Nesebar. On your way to Nesebar, you’ll pass the world-renown Sunny Beach resort, a summer tourism favorite populated with luxury hotels, bars, and nightclubs.Nesebar is situated on a long, narrow, manmade isthmus that reaches into the sea. Originally a Thracian settlement, it is known for its colorful history, from its colonization by the Greek to its capture by the Ottomans. Evidence of its varied history can be seen throughout the peninsula, alongside modern hotels, restaurants, and gift shops.Day 5: EtarBid goodbye to the coast as you head back inland to the mountains. Situated in the Balkan Mountains is the Etar, officially known as the Etar Architectural-Ethnographic Complex. It is an open-air museum that showcases life in old Bulgaria. It features various crafts, such as wood-working, pottery, coppersmith, needlework, and more.There is also a water mill and a variety of Bulgarian revival houses, featuring two stories and bay windows in a variety of colors – from vibrant orange to powder blue. If you stop to absorb the abundance of old Bulgarian customs, you must drop in for a cup of hand-brewed Turkish Sand Coffee. The fine coffee grinds and water are mixed in a “cezve” and brewed over hot sand, creating a rich, thick, memorable brew.Day 6: PlovdivAs you approach the final leg of your journey, it is time to witness the clashing of culture that is Bulgaria. That is why you must stop for a stroll in Plovdiv. Plovdiv was originally a Thracian settlement that was subsequently conquered by the Persians, Greeks, Celts, Romans, Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Slavs, Crusaders, and Turks. All of that makes the fact that the city dates back to the 8thmillennium BCE seem like small potatoes (but it’s not really).In fact, Plovdiv is globally known for being the oldest city in Europe – and one of the oldest in the world. Among its luxurious outdoor shopping malls, casinos, and fine eateries are the ruins (surprise, surprise) of the ancient Plovdiv Roman amphitheater and the Plovdiv Roman Stadium. It is also home to the oldest American academic institution outside of the U.S.The Plovdiv Roman amphitheater, also known as the Ancient Theater of Philippopolis, is well worth the visit. To this day, it hosts shows and performing arts events under the starlight. At dusk, when the theater is lit up with warm lights that emphasize its lavish columns and grandeur over the city, you will be absolutely mesmerized.Day 7: Rila MonasteryThis is the last stop as you inch your way back to the capital of Sofia. Located in the Rila Mountains, the Rila Monastery (which is home to over 60 monks) is of utmost cultural significance to the Bulgarian people. During the years of foreign rule, it served as a refuge for the Bulgarian people and a sanctuary for the preservation of their culture.It is named after St. Ivan of Rila, a patron saint of the Bulgarians and a hermit who lived in a cave and vowed to forego material possessions. The complex was built by his students. Note to travelers: when visiting the monastery, make sure to dress modestly or they will not allow you in. Shorts are prohibited at all costs, and quietness is encouraged.Just outside the monastery, travelers are allowed to engage in otherwise normal tourist activities. Street vendors sell rose liqueurs and handmade crafts, as well as fried powdered donuts (warning: be prepared to wait in line!)Read more about Bulgarian Food: The Ultimate Guide To The Most Underrated Cuisine.While enjoying your tasty treats, awe at the surrounding mountains – tall, strong, and stoic like the country’s people. Surely, while gazing upon Bulgaria’s landscapes and residents, you will feel a sense of pride for your own cultural and historic roots – whatever they may be. The beauty of Bulgaria is more than in the structures and fixtures that date back centuries, it is in its ability to remind you of each civilization’s resilience and hardships that have been engrained into history.As you take in the country’s idyllic mix of ruins and skyscrapers, mountain villages and sprawling cities, old and new – you will be reminded of the value to treasure your history, but embrace your present. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/sightseeing-the-real-deal-the-mines-of-potosi-bolivia/,"Sightseeing the Real Deal: The Mines of Potosi, Bolivia",Bolivia,"soda, cigarettes, and dynamiteAt the miner’s market, one can buy bottles of soda, thick cigarettes, tubes of crackers, 200-proof alcohol and dynamite, all from the same vendor. When tourists are led up to these stands, the Señora in charge happily assembles little packages of explosives, smokes, and bottles and helpfully recommends a coca leaf seller to complete the gift. Then, clutching their packages, the tourists are driven up the mountain in small vans that shake incessantly on the unpaved road.The tourist industry in Potosi, Bolivia is showy and honest and absurd. The city is home to what used to be the biggest silver mine in the world, Cerro Rico. At its peak, throughout the 1600s, it was the biggest, the richest, the most culturally opulent, and one of the most populous metropolises in the world. Since then, declining at time rapidly, at times less obviously, due to the waning of quality silver ore, the city has degenerated into one of the poorest regions in the second poorest nation in the entire Western hemisphere. Long dependent on what came out of the mines, Potosi is now trying to help make ends meet by bringing something into the mine: foreigners.The tours cost about $10-$20 and are usually led by ex-miners who’ve managed to get out of the mine, a fate often envied and revered by the brothers, friends, and father that stay behind. You’ll get a hard hat and lamp along with rubber boots and rain suit and the guide will lead you into a dusty, hellishly warm and narrow mine shaft. Many guides set off explosives with their groups on the mountainside before going into the mine – tends to be a crowd-pleaser for visitors from countries where explosives are less readily available. Inside, groups pay homage to the shaft’s anti-saint, a devil figure who must be appeased with words, cigarettes, booze, and coca in order for good ore to be released by the mountain. Then, they make their way around the shafts of the mine observing miners at work and talking to them. The baggies of goods from the market are gifted to miners.mine entranceIt’s totally chaotic because the mountain is unregulated, explosions are unannounced and uncalculated in any comprehensive way, children and men push heavy loads of mineral along crooked tracks in trolleys without breaks, there is little infrastructure and the mines are not designed to house the workers and their operations, not to mention tourists. But, for the curious and un-claustrophobic, it’s a very unfettered view of how the mountain and its eternal toilers live on after almost 500 years. What one learns is that conditions have not changed much since the days of [supposed] yore. Conditions are horrible, child labor rampant, wages bad, health problems inevitable, tools primitive. It’s extraordinarily difficult work with limited alternatives for mining families.I recommend finding a company with good safety and ethics records before booking a tour. Tours may be slightly more expensive, but several important things are at stake here: your safety, the guide’s knowledge of and responsibility to the shaft he takes the group to, quality of the gear (lamps, boots, etc) you get, quality of English (or other desired language) spoken by the guide, and the time the guide actually spends explaining what you’re seeing. Since everything is so unregulated, anyone can start an operation but it’s a lot better to hear this story from someone who knows it as well as someone who’s invested in it. I’ve gone twice, both with Marco Polo Tours’ (Bustillos 1036, [email protected]) Wilfredo Bracamonte and can’t recommend his tour highly enough. Also, consider skipping the mountainside fireworks display and gift the explosives to the miners, instead.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/morro-de-sao-paulo-tinhare-brazil/,"Morro de São Paulo, Brazil – The Most Beautiful Island You’ve Never Heard Of",Brazil,"When you think of a tropical island your mind immediately conjures up stereotypes of crystal clear waters, palm trees and white sandy beaches. Morro de São Paulo exceeds all these stereotypes.Nestled off the north coast of Brazil in the state of Bahia, Morro de São Paulo is a village on the Island of Tinharé, a couple hours boat ride from Salvador.I was fortunate enough to end up at Morro de São Paulo on a whim when I was traveling with some friends in Salvador. It has since become one place I tell every traveler to visit.Stepping off the boat onto the docks of this island made me feel as though I’d been transported right into the heart of the Caribbean. The sun gently kissed my skin and I breathed in the mix of warm sea air and tropical greenery.After being approached by locals offering to carry our bags for a fee we ascended the steep road leading out of the harbor. As we made our way to the main road of the village we noticed a distinct lack of vehicles, we later found out this is because cars are forbidden on Morro de São Paulo. A feature that I think helps the village maintain a much more relaxed pace.Walking further along the winding sandy path that is the main road, we reached the island’s first beach. Here we were confronted with the harsh reality of the situation, we’d found an island paradise that we may never want to leave.Imagine water that is the perfect temperature for relaxing in, the type of warmth that you’d expect after drawing yourself a bath to end a long hard days work. The sensation you get when you first step foot in the waters off Morro de São Paulo’s beaches is an overwhelming feeling of relaxation.The beaches have also been given rather creative names such as First Beach, Second Beach, Third Beach and yes you guessed it Fourth Beach.We checked ourselves into a nice little Pousada (guesthouse) close to all the life and partying that goes on near the aptly named Second beach. The staff at our guesthouse and at all the restaurants we visited all seemed to reflect the overall vibe of the island, content and relaxed.We spent the day exploring the Third and Fourth Beach, which is a seemingly endless coastline of palm trees. The fourth beach also offers some more boutique accommodation, complete with all the creature comforts of most high-class hotels. As we made our way around we periodically come across vendors offering a beer or some light snacks in the shade of the palm trees, complete with their very own lounge chairs. A perfect place to lie back while you indulge in the simplicity of your surroundings. It’s amazing how content one can feel with just a lapping shoreline in front of them.At nighttime we took our pick from the many restaurants lining the First and Second Beach or tucked away in the streets just behind them. We noticed that all the menus and even some of the street signs were printed in Portuguese, English and Hebrew. The Portuguese made sense and without trying to sound imperialistic so did the English, but we weren’t sure why there was Hebrew everywhere. We eventually found the answer to this; Morro de São Paulo is a particularly popular destination for Israeli tourists.When we went down to the beach to have a few drinks after dinner, we were accompanied by a few of the local street dogs. Now I’ve encountered street dogs in many major cities across South America and they aren’t a particularly friendly breed. But the ones on this island aren’t exposed to the intense survival of the fittest mentality of their urban cousins, so they were actually quite placid and very friendly. As a dog lover I’m a bit of a softy so I couldn’t help but show them some affection when they come over to us, as a result these dogs ended up flocking to us whenever we came past the beach over the next couple of days. I have to admit this made me feel ever more at home on this island.We kept the night going by visiting the only club on the island, where everyone flocks to later in the evening. There are just enough people on the island to fill up this one venue and give it a nice party vibe, it was a great chance to mingle with the rest of the people on the island and share in the good atmosphere.Our night finished by returning to the beach to watch the sunrise come up over the horizon. After having such a perfect day this seemed like a very fitting end, we sat there on the rocks jutting out from a point on the shoreline and we watched as the darkness gave way to the amber light creeping from behind the clouds. Looking back on the island behind us as it was lit up by the rising sun we breathed it all in.For people who appreciate the simple comforts in life, a cold beer, some delicious food, warm sun and clear water, this island offers everything you could ask for at a nice relaxing pace.How To Get ThereThe easiest way is to get there is to take the ferry or catamaran, which leave & return several times a day, from the Mercado Modelo in Salvador (a five-minute walk from the lower end of the Lacerda Elevator). The cost is around R$80 and the trip takes approximately 2 hours. When you first arrive you’ll also be required to pay a tourist tax.If you go to Morro de Sao Paulo during the high season (December thru March) make sure you make a reservation in advance since all the guesthouses and villas tend to be fully booked.What To BringIn Morro de São Paulo there are no banks only ATMs and despite the fact that most hotels and restaurants accept credit cards it is a good idea to have some extra cash with you when you arrive.Don’t take too much heavy luggage either. Clothing at Morro de São Paulo is usually casual. Morro is a place to chill and party – no need to overdress. You’ll almost always be walking on sand so sandals are the way to go.You can find more information at:http://www.morrodesaopauloinfo.com/en/http://www.morrodesaopaulo.com.br/maine.shtml  Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/favela-tours-in-rio-de-janeiro-brazil/,"Favela Tours in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",Brazil,"My favorite view of Rio de Janeiro wasn’t from Christ’s feet upon Corcovado or even from the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was from Rocinha, one of Rio’s largest favelas on a favela tour.Favelas are illegal settlements primarily built and occupied by lower-class Brazilians. If you’ve seen the movie “City of God” or Snoop Dogg’s music video for “Beautiful” you’ve glimpsed a glammed up version of a favela. Famously located on the hills surrounding Rio, favelas are home to roughly 20% of the city’s metropolitan population. And in an ironic twist, though most lack essential public services such as water, sewage, and garbage removal, they have a million dollar view of Rio’s colorful cityscape, its lush urban forests, and the Atlantic Ocean.Favela tourism is a touchy topic. Some passionately believe favela tours exploit local communities by turning the impoverished neighborhoods into “human zoos” for rich Westerners to peruse at their leisure. Others think they provide an enlightening experience, exposing well-to-do travelers to the realities of poverty.I believe both sides are a simplification. I think the experience can be eye-opening but not life changing. I also don’t think a few gringos walking down the street adversely affect any neighborhood—favela or otherwise. In fact, if the guides and drivers are from or connected to the community, and some of the money is used to benefit the residents, I’m hard pressed to find an argument opposed to the practice.In 2012 I toured Rio’s favelas with a company that donates part of its profits to a local community center that helps children excel in school and move on to higher education. Our driver was a local resident.What I found most surprising about my visit to these colorful hillside slums was not how dangerous they are (though there are many articles you can read about the drug lords and gun violence), but rather how organized everything was. I’ve lived in several major Latin American cities and capitals, and the slums surrounding them wash away in a downpour or fall down during a minor tremor.  In Rio, it is different. The houses are built from concrete and don’t look like they’re going anywhere. And though services can be sketchy and often illegal, tricky wiring allows residents to enjoy electricity, even cable tv.When I expressed my surprise, our guide informed me that despite their poverty, most favela residents are employed as construction workers, electricians, and plumbers. Basically, favelas are teeming with the types of people that keep the richer neighborhoods down below functioning. So is it any surprise that with a bit of elbow grease and legally-questionable wiring they’ve been able to create a functional community up above?With hundreds of favelas, some under police control and some not, my observations are vast generalizations. But during my visit to Rocinha and Vila Canoas—a much nicer and smaller favela—I did not feel unsafe or unwelcome. In fact, I felt like I was walking through the outskirts of Mexico City, abet with a much better view.My reasons for visiting a favela were not altruistic. I visited the favela for myself. I was intrigued, and for me, a vital part of travel is embracing the unknown. I’m not a millionaire and yet I enjoyed strolling the streets of Jardim Botanico (a rich Rio district) for the same reasons I enjoyed my short foray into the favelas: It was new and different and at the end of the day, it helped me understand just a little bit more of this world. Did a 3-hour tour in an air conditioned van teach me what favela life is actually like? Of course not. The tour was a superficial sample. But it was better than no taste at all. Share this: "

A beautiful glass chandelier decorated with 24-karat gold and a total of 88,680 Swarovski crystal beads dominates the atrium.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}State Room – The Disney DreamFabulous Food – Exceptional Dining ExperiencesAnimator’s PalateEnchanted GardenRoyal PalaceCabanasPalo and Remy – Cranking it up a NotchFun Times on the Enhanced Disney DreamOceaneer ClubAndy’s RoomKids Skipping Meals to Join the Rebel Alliance!Time for Dessert – Vanellope’s Sweets and Treats ShopWhat Else is New?Bibbidi Bobbidi BoutiqueShore Excursions and Spa ActivitiesCastaway CayStaying on the ShipRainforest RoomSenses Juice BarQuiet CoveSo Much to DoCabanas’ Marinated Lamb Chops RecipeState Room – The Disney DreamMy spacious stateroom came with a queen bed, a sitting area complete with a sleeping sofa, a 22″ LCD flat-screen TV, a desk, and a private verandah. There was plenty of closet space, and I loved the fact that I could store all of my luggage under the bed.Lots of electric outlets, an iPod docking station, a hairdryer, an in-room safe, a refrigerator, and individual climate control added to my personal comfort.Having one bathroom with a vanity, sink, shower, and tub, plus a half bathroom with a vanity, sink, and toilet was an additional bonus. To top it all, there were plenty of Elemis bath and shower products.My favorite hangout, however, was the verandah equipped with comfy patio furniture. I started each morning watching the sunrise over the ocean while enjoying an early breakfast, courtesy of the free room service offered on all Disney cruises.Animators Palate main dish Ginger-Teriyaki dusted Angus Beef TenderloinFabulous Food – Exceptional Dining ExperiencesThroughout the cruise, guests rotate to another restaurant each night. Each dining venue provides a uniquely themed experience.

Crush, the sea turtle from Finding Nemo, appears on multiple screens and interacts with guests throughout the meal.Enchanted GardenEnchanted Garden is a casual restaurant inspired by the gardens of Versailles, featuring a seasonal menu of market-fresh ingredients.When you GoCruise Travel Insurance – 3 Reasons you need it Last Minute Cruise DealsRoyal PalaceThe Royal Palace, a casual yet elegant restaurant, serves continental cuisine for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.CabanasCabanasserves buffet-style food and is a perfect casual alternative if you are pressed for time. I was amazed at the quality and diversity of the food at Cabanas. My favorite meal there was lunch on embarkation day. There was plenty of seafood and my all-time favorite, lamb chops. Trust me, they are simply delicious. (You can find the Cabanas Marinated Lamb Chops recipe at the end of this article!)Palo and Remy – Cranking it up a NotchAdults 18 and up can dine at Palo($30 surcharge), a premier restaurant featuring modern Italian cuisine, and Remy($85 surcharge), an exquisite, French-inspired gourmet restaurant.I did not have a chance to experience Remy, but I did dine at Palo. The food was superb, but the service lacked luster.While I welcome the concept of adult-only dining, I do not think that it is a necessity on a Disney cruise. I can only reiterate that each meal I had at one of the assigned restaurants (Animator’s Palate, Royal Palace, and Secret Garden) was amazing, and so were the waiters, anticipating any possible request I had.Millennium Falcon – The Disney DreamFun Times on the Enhanced Disney DreamOceaneer ClubThe Disney Dream, after an extensive upgrade, has emerged with lots of new features for kids and adults. Winning the prize for the coolest enhancement ever is, of course, the new play area inside the Oceaneer Club, where you’ll find the Millennium Falcon a console equipped with more than 1,000 LED lights, plus hundreds of buttons, switches, and special effects. It is the centerpiece of a recreational area for kids ages 3-12, where aspiring Jedis can pilot the pride of Han Solo, learn the ways of the Force, partake in role-playing, and enjoy high-tech interactive games based on Disney Infinity video games.Andy’s RoomAndy’s RoomThe younger set will be more comfortable in Andy’s Room, a colorful bedroom where the world of Disney·Pixar’s Toy Story comes to life, or at Pixie Hollow, a whimsical space that transports children to the magical world of Tinker Bell.Kids Skipping Meals to Join the Rebel Alliance!Danny Handke, the Creative Designer Lead of the new Star Wars-themed space, told me at a media event that kids are so enthralled with the new play area that they do not want to leave. Some are even skipping meals for a chance to go to a galaxy far, far away. During an open house for adults, I got to see what it is all about. When my time was up, I, too, experienced the pain of letting go (pun intended). David Handke’s remark about kids skipping meals made me curious, so I double-checked with Thomas Praxmarer, the Hotel Director, to ask if he had seen any decline in kids attending sit-down meals. The answer was a resounding “yes.”Vanelloppe SweetsTime for Dessert – Vanellope’s Sweets and Treats ShopKids and grownups alike rally at the new Wreck It Ralph-themed Vanellope’s Sweets and Treats shop. The three-scoop, five-topping Von Schweetz’s Race Kart Sundae served in Vanellope’s very own race car is my favorite. I don’t know what I liked most – the employee religiously making the treat – or the excitement in the eyes of the kid watching him do so. If you are a Kitchen Sink fan, there is a larger version (eight-scoops, eight-toppings) served in a trophy cup.What Else is New?Bibbidi Bobbidi BoutiqueThe Disney Dream is now home to a Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, where young princesses and aspiring pirates can get makeovers. The space was lovely and offered costumes unique to Disney Cruise Line, such as a Captain Mickey uniform.Shore Excursions and Spa ActivitiesGoing off the ship in Nassau is easy and, unless you want an escorted excursion, you are perfectly fine to just do your own thing. I am personally not interested in shopping for items I can get anywhere in the world, nor am I a fan of Atlantis. I walked around town and enjoyed taking in the scenery.Castaway CayFor Disney’s private island Castaway Cay, I signed up for the 5K run, which is free and comes with a nifty medal. I have done quite a lot of Disney races, coast to coast; while I knew I could do it, I also knew it was going to be painful. Even though the race starts before any other offshore activity, remember: It’s hot, people!Ninety-degrees and half an hour later, I collected the precious “bling” and enjoyed the adults-only beach and a fabulous barbecue.Adult Beach at Castaway CayStaying on the ShipWhen the ship is in a port of call, and you are not interested in going off the ship, the greatest place to be is at the Senses Spa on Deck 11. Special packages are available on days the ship is in port, and there is certainly no overcrowding.Rainforest RoomMy favorite thing to do is to use the Rainforest Room. For as little as $16, you can enjoy a dry sauna, a hot steam room, scented showers, and heated loungers, as well as two hot tubs overlooking the sea. For an extra $11, you can purchase a Do-It-Yourself scrub. Choices are Vanilla Orange, Chocolate Peppermint, Lavender Herbal, or Tangerine.Senses Juice BarNew at the Senses Spa is the Senses Juice Bar, where you can enjoy healthy, made-to-order fruit and vegetable smoothies.Adult Deck – The Disney Dream Quiet CoveAlso fun but for adults only is Quiet Cove on Deck 11, which offers a freshwater pool, jetted hot tubs overlooking the Ocean, and plenty of chaise longues for sunbathing. New on Deck 13 is Satellite Falls, where adults can soak up the sun in loungers or relax in the shade under a circular splash pool. I visited Satellite Falls several times, but it was never operational because high winds prevented the rain curtain from working properly.So Much to DoFrom Broadway-style shows to deck parties, there is something going on for everyone at all times. Keeping track of all the entertainment offered is an impossible task. Make sure to study the daily Navigator, a publication listing everything going on onboard. But most of all, relax and have fun!For more information on how to book your next Disney Cruise, consult the company’s website or for discounts check out Cruise Direct..With Minnie after 5K on Castaway CayCheck out the Unofficial Guide to Disney Cruise Line 2016, available January 5, 2016, for a complete review of all ships, activities, and port itineraries.Cabanas’ Marinated Lamb Chops RecipeRecipe courtesy dclnews.comIngredients:1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil1/2 lemon, zested and juiced1/2 teaspoon dried oregano1/2 teaspoon ground cumin1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 clove garlic, roughly chopped8 to 10 lamb chopslight olive oil, for cookingPreparation:Whisk together oil, lemon zest and juice, oregano, cumin, and pepper in a shallow dish.

https://amateurtraveler.com/junkanoo-caribbean-celebration-new-year-bahamas/,Junkanoo: A Caribbean Celebration of the New Year in the Bahamas,Bahamas,"Every year over the winter holiday season, my family and I enjoy taking a cruise to the Caribbean.  Often we have found ourselves visiting the Bahamas where we have heard tales and have seen remnants of a festival called Junkanoo.  Unfortunately, we always seem to miss the festival because it takes place early in the morning on December 26th.  This year due to the weather, our cruise ship ended up in Nassau from the middle of Christmas Day through December 26th.  As soon as our plans changed, I quickly realized that finally experiencing Junkanoo would be a real possibility.Junkanoo is a unique Boxing Day celebration of indigenous dance and music held every year in the Bahamas on December 26th.  The largest celebration takes place in downtown Nassau and officially begins with a parade at 1 AM in the morning.  Grandstands for viewing the festivities and a judging area are set up in the center of town on Bay Street.  I have never attended Carnival in Rio or Mardi Gras in New Orleans, but it seemed to me that the colors, sights, sounds, and celebratory atmosphere of Junkanoo are probably similar.  There are many places to get local food and the atmosphere on the street is one of a large party.The costumed revelers, in organized groups called “shacks,” parade through downtown Nassau in a slow, rhythmic dance called “rushing.”  They intensely compete for prizes for best performance, costume, dancing and music.  Each group chooses their own theme and the group members dress in elaborate, colorful costumes that feature exotic designs, vibrant colors, beads, foils, rhinestones, and unique, original decorations.  Some marchers play instruments and other carry props.  The parade also features enormous floats that are often carried by one person and can weigh up to 200 pounds (90 kg).  Parade viewers support their favorite groups by blowing whistles, blasting horns, ringing cowbells, and beating drums.  The entire parade is a continual banquet of colors, exotic images, drum beats, and wonderful island sounds.  It is an intense delight for the senses.A group of family and friends from our cruise ship headed out to the parade at 1 AM.  Unfortunately, once we were on the street, we found out that the first parade groups would not reach the center of town until around 3 AM.  All of us headed back to the ship.  By 3 AM, only my wife and I were up to the early morning challenge of experiencing Junkanoo.  It took a while for us to figure out where we could see the parade, since we were not able to get much reliable information during the day.  We eventually found a vantage point along Bay Street.  The sounds were wonderful.  The mix of drum beats, horns, whistles, and bells was intoxicating.  Dancers moved and swayed while the crowd cheered on their every move.  As the groups progressed, the rhythmic  sounds grew more intense and we became caught up the joy of it.Junkanoo is a long parade and some groups were more impressive than others.  The largest groups have up to 1000 revelers.  Some of our favorites were the Valley Boys, the Saxons, and One Family.  We even heard from people on the street that the Prime Minister of the Bahamas was marching in costume with the Valley Boys.If you have the opportunity to see Junkanoo, I have a few suggestions to make your visit more enjoyable.  The posted times for the festival suggest that it begins at 1 AM on December 26th.  In actuality, the first group does not appear until around 3 AM.  There are places to view the parade from the street, but you will see much more if you purchase a grandstand seat.  There is a ticket office on the west end of the Nassau cruise port terminal.  The parade usually finishes around 10 AM in the morning.  It is entirely possible to view much of the parade in the early daylight hours, but there is something magical about seeing it late at night under the lights.  The sequins and bright colors of the costumes seem more enchanting under the night lights.  The parade goes on for a long time and there are significant gaps of time between the performances of each group.  If you decide to watch from the street, the best free viewing areas are on East Bay Street.  If you are on a cruise ship and you arrive early to Nassau on the December 26th, you can still catch a few hours of the parade since it often lasts until 10 AM.  If you miss Junkanoo on December 26th, the parade is repeated in the early morning hours of January 1st.  Another option is the competitive junior Junkanoo parade featuring primary and secondary school students that is usually held in the evening a week prior to the Boxing Day celebration.  There is even a summer Junkanoo celebration held on Grand Bahama Island at Taino Beach from mid-July to mid-August.If you have the opportunity to see Junkanoo, don’t pass it up.  It is a sensory explosion of Caribbean sights and sounds that will give you an incredible appreciation of the culture of the Bahamas.  Bring a whistle and cowbell and join the crowds on the street. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/top-5-sights-to-visit-in-the-bahamas-with-kids/,Top 5 Sights to Visit in the Bahamas with Kids,Bahamas,"Many parents worry about keeping their children entertained on a family vacation, but this needn’t be a concern when traveling to the Bahamas.  Here are five attractions that are sure to be enjoyed by both parents and their children visiting this beautiful chain of islands.1 – Dolphin EncountersBlue Lagoon Dolphin Encounters (Nassau/Paradise Island) allows families to learn about marine life in the Bahamas through a series of exhibits that provide an up-close and personal look at animals. Along with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to swim with dolphins and pet a sea lion, guests are able to participate as a Program Observer, in which they are taught about natural history, animal training, and ocean conservation.2 – AquaventureAquaventre at Atlantis (Nassau/Paradise Island) isn’t as much of an educational experience, but it certainly is one the whole family can enjoy. The water park is 141 acres of aquatic adventure, from high-speed water slides to river rides, and a lazy river for a relaxing float around the park. Perhaps the most popular attraction at Aquaventure is Splashers, a Mayan inspired pool complete with a temple. The pool is shallow enough for young children to play in, and the temple is equipped with slides, rope-bridges, and water cannons. Additionally, there is an outdoor rock wall from which climbers are rewarded a view of the entire water park when they reach the top.3 – Garden of the GrovesGarden of the Groves (Grand Bahama Island), a 12-acre private nature park, gives parents the opportunity to treat their children to the natural side of the Bahamas in a more controlled environment than one might find in a forest reserve. Garden of the Groves is certified by the U.S Wildlife Federation as a Wildlife Habitat and features lush vegetation filled with butterflies, migratory birds, and indigenous vegetation. Located on the property are several waterfalls, a chapel, and a shopping and dining area.4 – Fort FincastleFort Fincastle was built on Bennet’s Hill in 1793 in order to protect Nassau from invaders. Although the fort never experienced a threat so great as to require the garrison’s guns to be fired, parents will appreciate it for its historic value – and kids will love its unique boat-like shape and its “cool” canons. The historic water tower now houses an elevator that allows guests to ride to the top and experience a view of Nassau that is unparalleled.5 – The BeachThe beaches are one of the most appealing aspects of the Bahamas – something both parents and children will enjoy. Kids can easily keep themselves entertained for hours, splashing in the surf and building sandcastles in the soft, powdery white sand. The older ones may even want to participate in watersports like body surfing, and snorkeling. The following are some of the many beaches in the Bahamas that are popular for families with children:Cable Beach on New Providence Island is accessible from the Sheraton and Wyndham Hotels. The beach is somewhat small, making it easy to keep track of frolicking children, but it can get crowded by tourists staying at nearby resorts. The waters are clear and water sports like jet skiing and boating are both popular activities.Lucayan Beach on Grand Bahama Island is located directly across the street from the Port Lucaya hotels in Freeport at the end of Sea Breeze Lane. This beach is great for parents traveling with older children interested in doing more than swimming. Vendors along the shore offer a number of options, such as parasailing and jet-skiing. Snorkeling equipment, boogie boards, Frisbees, and more are available to rent.Pink Sand Beach on Harbour Island is protected by a coral reef, which keeps the surf mild enough for youngsters and novice swimmers to enjoy without the risk of being bowled over by choppy waves. Pink Sand Beach runs the entire length of the island’s east coast, making it accessible from most side roads that lead east off Dunmore Street.With these attractions and more, a trip to the Bahamas is sure to keep even the most energetic children enthralled – and the best part is that parents will find them pleasurable as well.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/panama-canal-trip-journal/,Panama Canal Trip Journal,Bahamas,"This journal covers a cruise to Panama on Holland America through Insight / Geek Cruises. The cruise was a Shakespeare cruise done in conjunction with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and a Mac cruise done in conjunction with MacWorld.Friday November 2, San Jose to FloridaThe alarm goes off very early when you are trying to be at the airport before 6am for a 6:50am flight. A close friend Brad volunteered to take us to the airport… a very close friend indeed. Although in reality it was his wife Janice who actually woke up when their alarm went off so very early in the morning.Our flights to Atlanta and then on to Fort Lauderdale were both happily uneventful and we used the time to sleep, read magazines ( I brought 2-3 inches of my backlog for this leg of the trip), or do homework (Joan). We took a shuttle ($15 a person) to the Westin Fort Lauderdale where I was surprised to find that I had apparently reserved a suite.Almost immediately after our arrival we went to a party put on by the Shakespeare at Sea / Insight Cruises program that we were joining for this trip. By the time that the evening was done we had met more people on this cruise without setting foot on the boat than we had in a week at sea on our previous cruise. Most of the crowd was older than us, some by a margin. They also were more regular or more recent patrons of the Oregon Shakespeare festival than Joan and I. I had gone to Ashland, where OSF resides, in 2006 with our kids and their high school drama group but we had not been to the festival for a few years before that. Before the birth of our kids Joan and I had gone more regularly. I had gone to Ashland with a group from my high school 4 years in a row in the 1970s. The vast majority of the people at the party were from the west coast and the majority were from the San Francisco bay area. We very quickly found interesting people to talk to. We even found some Mac people who ventured in from the Mac party and some others like myself who were fans of both Mac and Shakespeare.Before going to bed I recorded a new introduction to an old episode of the Amateur Traveler podcast for publication on November 10th.Saturday November 3, Leaving Fort LauderdaleThe ship was scheduled to leave port at 5 pm which gave us plenty of time. We slept in, booked a place on the Holland America shuttle bus ($12 a person), brought our luggage to the truck and then went to brunch. We still had time to kill before the buses started to leave at 12:30 pm so we tried to get the last little bits of email etc off the internet before we had to pay $25 an hour to connect.We met more people while we waited for a tour of the ship. Our biggest fear was that our tour guide had gotten lost. Finally Colby, one of the assistant cruise directors, showed up and led us from bow to stern, from the dining room to the theatre, and much of what was in between. We had been on one similar cruise before on Royal Caribbean on the Empress of the Seas. This cruise was on Holland America’s Volendam. The Empress carried around 1,000 passengers and the Volendam 1,400. Much of the two ships were the same. The dining room and theatre were very similar. The central atrium on the Volendam was in the range from uninspiring to ugly and garish. The Volendam has a small theatre in addition to the large theatre which is used for movies, talks and cooking classes as it has a demonstration kitchen behind the screen. The Empress had a small but nice library hidden away where you could exchange one of the books you had brought on board for one that someone else left. The Volendam tripled the size of the library, added a coffee bar, many internet stations, a DVD library ($3 a day unless you have a suite) and a decent sized library of books available for free check out. The Volendam has the usual collection of shops, bars and a casino. It does have 3 self-serve laundries. It does not have a climbing wall or equally flashy gimmick. It has two pools, the larger pool (still small) is chlorinated and the one that is on the bow and not surrounded by a wall is salt water since the water in the pool can splash into the ocean in a rougher sea. The roof on the main pool can be closed in case of rain. The Volendam also has a buffet restaurant on the Lido deck as well as an upscale restaurant ($30 per person not counting wine).Before we left port we did a lifeboat drill where all of the passengers crowded onto 3rd deck where the lifeboats are located. Women and children are still first so the men lined up in the back and the ladies in the front. Pity the person who is claustrophobic as the ships passengers just fit on the 3rd deck. Since the lifejackets have the ship’s cabin on them, the crew checked off most people as they arrived and then just called out the names of the ones they were missing. We were assured that there were plenty of lifeboats for all the passengers.At 5 pm there was a Sail Away party on the deck in the stern of the ship. There was a live band and of course cocktails as we watched the Florida coast drift away. We waved at the Pilot boat and the people on land as we chatted with more people attending the Mac cruise including Janet from Apple’s Education department. Some of the people on the Mac cruise had the cruise paid for by their jobs, which seems to make that audience somewhat more varied in age than the Shakespeare cruise. Eventually the party was broken up by strong winds that started blowing the chairs all over the deck (predominantly the ones without anyone in them).At 7 pm the Shakespeare at Sea had a cocktail party to welcome everyone. We received our schedules, listened to welcoming remarks and met still more cruise mates.At 8 pm we adjourned to the dining room for the late seating of dinner. The plan is to shuffle the tables each night among the Shakespeare at Sea attendees so that we can meet more people. I was more impressed with my dinner than Joan, so the quality seemed to depend somewhat on what you ordered.At 10 pm Joan and I went to the evening’s movie which was Evan Almighty. Only 2 other people attended although they had prepared popcorn for more like ten times that number.Sunday November 4, Half Moon CayToday’s port of call was Half Moon Cay, which is a private island in the Bahamas owned by Holland America. We tendered into the island into a man-made harbor by the beach. The beach was a beautiful beach with fine white sand. Near the beach were bars, gift shops, an information booth, an outdoor kitchen, covered picnic areas and private cabanas. We rented a clamshell to provide shade for our chaise lounges ($10). We swam in the morning, read and napped. I tried out my underwater video camera. I thought that there were no fish in the water until I found out later that I had caught one in a video. Lunch was a BBQ on the island prepared in the outdoor kitchen. After lunch we took a cycling tour of the island. It was supposed to be a guided tour but our tour guide did not actually seem to like to talk or provide information so we were not always clear where we were going or why we had stopped here. We stopped at the horse corral, at the inner lagoon (and saw some old ruined houses), and the sting ray lagoon. The pace of the group was slow but the distances were very short. Serious bikers would probably be very frustrated with the tour.After returning to the ship we went to the large theatre where we were supposed to see a new performance put on by the OSF actors but it turns out that their costumes and props had gone missing (they later turned up in Florida) so instead Bill Rauch, the new artistic director, talked about his background and then answered questions about what his plans where for OSF. He had some very interesting experiences with a theatre company called Cornerstone, which he helped found with 14 friends right out of college. They started with a mission of bringing live theatre to small towns in the U.S. but ended up morphing into a mission of using theatre to bring communities and diverse groups together.I then went to a Mac event where Randal Shwartz talked about cool utilities for the Macintosh. I had heard of most of these utilities but still picked up some interesting new ones to check out when I get home.At dinner we met still more Californians in the Shakespeare group and talked about Shakespeare, audio books, web sites (one of the group owns LovePoems.com) and travel.The evening’s entertainment was Michael James who juggled, rode a unicycle, heckled the audience and climbed an 8 foot ladder which was free standing. The audience was a bit surprised when he really rode the unicycle with a member of the audience on his shoulders. We were probably even more surprised that she went along with it.Monday November 5, At SeaOur morning started with a lecture on violence in Shakespeare from Christopher Duval. He talked about the weapons (rapier) and styles of combat in Shakespeare’s day. He also said one census from the time had 130 men for every 100 women which caused great sexual tensions which are played out in Romeo and Juliet.The next talk was again with Bill Rauch talking about the 2008 OSF season. Joan attended but I worked out in the gym instead. It is surprising that on a ship of 1400 people it is not hard to find a free machine in the gym. They had maybe 20 aerobic machines of which no more than 10 were in use at any given time.After lunch I attended a question and answer session with 4 of the actors, which Joan skipped so she could work out. The stories the actors told often left us in stitches. My favorite was a story of a production of Julius Caesar (not at OSF) where just after Caesar was killed in a very dramatic fashion with lots of stage blood, the assassins paused to let the audience take in the moment. In the silence a phone started ringing off stage. No one knew what to do until one of the actor’s ad libbed “what if it is for Caesar?”The second session was watching the film Romeo and Juliet from 1968 by Franco Zefferelli. Barry Kraft gave some introductory remarks about what to watch for in this particular production. The theatre was warm and more than one head nodded off when the lights went out. It was a good production but I was not the only one hoping that just this once it would not end so badly for our star crossed lovers.I stayed in the same theatre for another 2 hours to hear Jason Snell of MacWorld give a presentation on Leopard 101 (Mac OS 10.5). I knew much of what he was presenting but there was enough that I did not know to make the presentation (which was well done) worthwhile.Dinner was our first of 3 formal dinner evenings, so I rushed quickly from the Mac talk to the room to change and then on to the dining room. Yet again we had wonderful dinner table mates. We can’t join in the discussions on the most recent OSF productions, but also found may other things to talk about. Our table had 2 doctors and their wives (a hand surgeon at Shriner’s hospital in LA and a Ob/Gyn from Bellevue Washington). They each had a couple of stories of being asked “is there a doctor in the house… or on the plane…Tuesday November 6, at ArubaOur ship was not scheduled to arrive in Aruba until noon so I attended Robin Williams’ (not that one) class Fourth Wall? What Fourth Wall? The Elizabethan Stage. Robin showed pictures of the old globe and the new globe in London and talked about how actors in the New Globe gained new insights about Shakespeare’s plays when they performed those plays on a stage similar to that which he used. Particularly it became clear how many speeches were aimed at the groundlings who stood at the very edge of the stage. She also introduced us to the Wheel of Fortune and the Great Chain of Being and we learned the proper use of thee/thou vs you in Elizabethan English.After that I went to a session on podcasting by Randal Schwartz on the Macmania track. I can only hope that my comments were helpful as I did not go as much to learn as to share.For our shore excursion we did a sea kayaking and snorkeling trip. We had 3 very nice guides who showed us how to paddle and un-capsize a kayak (fortunately the second set of knowledge went unused). We had never kayaked before but had wanted to try it. We did not steer anything like a straight course but did manage to get to and from a park down the coast which we used as a base for snorkeling. I had brought my prescription swim goggles so I went out without a mask and snorkel which made the snorkel part of the excursion more work. There was not really great visibility but at least I was able to start getting the hang of the underwater video camera (Sanyo Xacti) that I had recently purchased. The guides made us wear life vests which just got in the way. Mine kept coming unzipped which just gave me one more thing to fuss with. We were warned by the guides that fire coral which was prevalent in the area would give us a painful and permanent tattoo should we touch it.After the excursion we walked around the port area of Aruba but only had to venture a block or so before the city started looking pretty seedy.Wednesday November 7, at CuraçaoWe had booked a cruise and snorkel excursion through http://ShoreTrips.com for Curaçao. Since we were not booking through the cruise line we were the only people from our ship on the excursion and had to wait by the port’s gate for almost a half hour after the time they had given us before the van picked us up. The van took us to Spanish Bay, which was a distance away. Unlike Aruba, much of Curaçao looked attractive and I would like to spend more time there some time. At Spanish Bay we took a Zodiac out to the sailing schooner Bounty. The ship had about 40 passengers and a crew of 5. We motored out of the bay and then raised the two jibs to sail to our first snorkel destination. There was a free open bar on the boat so I got my diet coke fix and a rum punch or two during our 5 hour voyage. The visibility was better at Curaçao than we had seen at Aruba and both the outing before and after lunch were quite fun (so fun that I did not notice how fried my back was getting in the tropical sun). After a nice lunch on the boat we motored a short distance to the wreck of a tug boat. I was able to shoot underwater video that reminded me of the Titanic. All in all it was an excellent outing which left me grinning profusely and fried to a crisp.Thursday November 8, at SeaFriday November 9, Panama CanalWe arose early (thankful for gaining an hour in the time change as we sailed West to Panama and Eastern Time) to watch the ship enter the 3 locks that took the ship up the 85 feet from sea level to the level of Gatun Lake. The canal has 6 sets of locks total but the ship just went up halfway and then back down again to the Caribbean. We left the ship in Gatun Lake for a 7 hour adventure across Panama by bus to a ferry on which we rode out the 3 remaining locks to the Pacific ocean. Being in the lock in a small boat is a different perspective from the big cruise ship. The canal seemed surprisingly small to me. We saw where they are starting the new expanded canal, which will allow the canal to carry larger ships. I was also surprised at the Gaillard Cut how small the cut looked. It is hard to believe that 20,000 people died in the French effort at this spot alone (of the 22,000 deaths). The area around the canal looks more pastoral than jungle these days. We had rain on our trip, which is not that surprising in an area that gets 250 inches of rain a year. We had a good local guide whose English we usually able to make out. Although when he said we were moving towards our “destiny” (when he meant “destination”) that sounded pretty ominous.Saturday November 10, Costa RicaWe had another early start (and to our surprise another time change to Central Time) in Costa Rica. Both at Panama and Costa Rica large numbers of passengers were doing shore excursions so we were gathered in the Frans Hals lounge (the largest theatre) where we were each tagged with a colored number sticker by tour group. With the rest of the red #7s we boarded a bus with a very articulate local guide. We transferred from the bus to a train for a ride through the rain forest and banana plantations. Living up to the name rain forest, it rained our entire day in Costa Rica. At times it rained quite hard. Our guide told us that the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica has two seasons: the rainy season and the rainier season. Some of our bus/train/ship mates still grumbled about the rain. We stopped at a banana packing plant but for some reason they were not working that day. They normally work every day and our guides were caught by surprise. Our bus driver works at one of these plants and is part of a program where he trained to be a driver and drives a couple of days a week. We learned that a banana plant will bear one and only one bunch of bananas (in about a year) and then will be chopped down. So they leave two younger plants growing from the same root system so that the same root system can bear 3 bunches of bananas in a year.After our train ride we stopped for a break with music, shopping, fresh fruit and fruit juice or beer (Imperial from Costa Rica) before boarding a boat where we cruised a short distance along the rain forest. We saw a sloth (curled in a ball against the rain) and several different types of birds: toucans, egrets, etc. We also saw small bats, which we would easily have missed if not for the sharp eyes of our boat driver.Sunday November 11, At SeaMonday November 12, At SeaI podcast about this trip at the Amateur Traveler podcast in these podcasts:Amateur Traveler Episode 113 – Theme Cruise to Panama (Shakespeare at Sea / MacMania)Amateur Traveler Video Episode 25 – Curaçao – Sailing and Snorkeling with the Bounty (part 1)Share this: "

It was 13 hours to Guangzhou (Canton), China, and then a 4-hour flight to Kathmandu.There are great views of Everest and the Himalayas between Guangzhou and Kathmandu provided you get a window seat on the right side of the plane. Pilots flying into Kathmandu airport require a special training certificate due to the airport being on a Mesa in a valley at the foot of the Himalayan mountains.It is a 13.45-hour time difference to California which wasn’t too bad maintaining contact with home. I have no idea about the 45 minutes! I’ve read it has to do with Nepal being 4 degrees of longitude off which they jokingly call “Nepal stretched time” and never makes them late by making them 15 minutes early to everything.I was greeted at the airport with a Nepal ceremonial scarf (Khada) signifying compassion, not unlike the custom of being presented with a lei upon arrival in Hawaii. Namaste!Facts about NepalNepal is 90% Hindu and 10% Buddhist despite Buddha being born in Nepal. Nepal opened for tourism in 1951. They drive on the left side of the road. The unit of currency is the Nepal Rupee, about R111 to the US dollar (2019). The Thamel district of Kathmandu is a pedestrian-only back street tourist shopping district. Dinner can be had at the Thamel House Restaurant which specialized in Nepali and Newari foods. It’s the former 150-year-old wood residence of a Newar craftsman. I would recommend the Nepali Ghar Hotel as a place to stay.Lukla Airport NepalLukla, NepalI flew to Lukla (Tenzing Hillary Airport), Nepal, at 9,338-foot elevation. It is the “Roof of the World”, the gateway to Everest and Sagarmatha National Park. It is the most extreme airport in the world; coming in at treetop level, landing over a 2,000-foot abyss and one of the highest airports in the world built by Sir Edmund Hillary. Lukla has no cars, foot traffic only. This is a very busy airport with over 50 airplane arrivals and 50 helicopter flights a day. Planes and sightseeing helicopters are constantly landing and turning around in 15 minutes.Lukla is a small village dependent on tourism. People from all over the world are here. This is the starting point for trekking to Everest Base Camp or climbing Everest. One-hour helicopter sightseeing flights to Kalapathar (above Everest Base Camp) are expensive unless you can share the cost. It was a beautiful day and I got to see Everest up close. Everest was declared the highest mountain in 1852. My helicopter reached 21,000 feet above sea level with an outside temperature of -9 degrees.The afternoon left me time to trek out a couple of miles on the Everest base camp trail walking in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hillary. I took a loop trail starting down a 1000 “step” trail to Chaurikharka and looping up to the Base Camp trail. The trail is very busy, a foot freeway, with trekkers, Sherpas, and mule or Zupki (ox) supply trains. I did well with the altitude but did have many rest stops when my heart started pounding too fast. What a great adventure.I stayed overnight at the Himalaya Lodge owned by the town’s go-to resident, Dawa Tshering Sherpa. The only downside was no heat and it’s cold at this elevation. Apparently, none of the hotels have heat.Kathmandu, NepalThe next morning, I flew back to Kathmandu. While waiting in the Lukla airport, I thought I was in an emergency room. So many of the trekkers were coughing like they all had bronchitis. Speaking of breathing issues, Kathmandu has very poor air quality. Let this be a health warning to anyone with respiratory issues, you should probably avoid Nepal. It caused me problems.Royal Narayanhiti Palace MuseumBack in Kathmandu, I visited the Royal Narayanhiti Palace Museum. It was the site of the massacre of the Nepal royal family in 2001. It houses the Crown Jewels and the usual palace rooms including the Throne Room. The current structure was built in 1963 but has been the site of the residence since 1846.That night, I went to Bhojan Griha for a traditional Nepal dinner. I was entertained with traditional folk music and costumed dances of the Sherpas and Gherkas. The building itself was 160 years old and served as a royal palace for the priests.I had a two-day tour of the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. The site is composed of seven properties. Most of the properties were being restored after the 2015 7.8 earthquake. Hanuman-dharma Durbar SquareThe first property I visited was Hanuman-dharma Durbar Square which contains an ancient wooden palace, Hanuman Statue (Red Monkey Hindu God), and various temples with intricate wood carvings all dating back to 1563. In addition, the House of Kumari is the home of a female child (4-year-old) known as the Living Goddess of Nepal. She presented herself to me from a balcony and I received her blessing.The valley was divided between three grandchildren who were each given their own city to rule, Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur. Being siblings, they tried to outdo each other with their Palace Square or Durbar. This was the first. The second property is Swayambu Stupa where the Buddhist Saint Manjushree found a lotus flower in the center of a lake, drained the lake, and established Kathmandu.Monkey TempleA stupa is a Buddhist temple that has prayer wheels you walk left around the Stupa spinning and chanting “Om Mane Padme Hun” which means “hail to the jewel in the lotus.” It is also called the “Monkey Temple” due to all the Assamese monkeys on the grounds. You get a good view of the city of Kathmandu from here despite the polluted air.The third property is a Bhudda Stupa built in the fifth century and is one of the largest in Nepal. Here you will find a school of Thankas (tantric Buddhist paintings). They are intricate, detailed, vividly colored, beautiful, and painted with cat hairbrushes.Pashupatinath TempleThe fourth property is Pashupatinath Temple dedicated to Shiva and built 500 years ago. This temple is the holiest Hindu temple in Nepal. The grounds along the sacred Bagmati River serve as a cremation site known as Arya Ghat. I encountered at least three cremations occurring and one body openly being prepared for cremation.Patan Durbar SquareThe fifth property is Patan Durbar Square, the second grandchild’s city. It is known as the city of “Beauty”. It’s known for its artists, craftsman, and metal workers. The Patan Museum (a temple) contains examples of metal sculptures. The square contains Buddhist monuments, Hindu temples, a Golden Temple, and guardian risqué statues. The royal palace has a royal bath with two snake statutes running along each side and 102 wooden hand carvings of Buddha’s hand and finger positions (AKA the original emojis). The palace and temple all have Golden Doorways.Bhaktapur Durbar SquareThe sixth property is Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the final grandchild’s city. It is known as the city of ” Devotees” and is the oldest of the three founded in 889 AD. It contains many of the same types of buildings as the other two with the exception of a five-tiered temple. One temple had a wooden gate that was exquisitely carved that the king had the craftsman’s hands cut off and buried nearby so he could not create another. The palace has 55 wooden windows. There is a working pottery kiln.Changu Narayan TempleThe seventh and final property is Changu Narayan Temple, a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, perched on a hill. It is one of Kathmandu’s oldest shrines. There was a religious ceremony occurring while I was there, and the ladies were all dressed in traditional attire. After visiting all these cultural properties, there sure is a lot of steps in this town. And the street merchants were like flies.Shivapuri Nagarjun National ParkI took one morning and hiked in Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park. I took a hired 4WD jeep up a one-lane narrow dirt track to the top of Shivapuri Peak at 8963 feet and hiked straight down to 4429 feet. At the top, there are clear views of the Himalaya range. I saw a Barking Deer and Kalij Pheasant.Interestingly, the ex-king’s palace home is inside the park and I had to go through four military checkpoints. The third checkpoint had a machine gun nest. Poachers don’t seem to be a problem at this park. Also, I learned Nepal doesn’t have park rangers, per se. The parks are patrolled by a special Army unit trained for park work.Sarauha, NepalMy next destination was Sarauha, Nepal. I got there by bus. It was unique to see working elephants transporting materials and the town rhino just walking down Main street on a daily basis.I had three safaris around Chitwan National Park which is a World Heritage Site, Nepal’s first national park, and one of those “places to see before you die”.Budhi Rapti RiverThe first was a Silk Cotton Tree dugout canoe. I floated about three miles down the Budhi Rapti River. We saw two Mugger crocodiles and a spotted deer.Chitwan National Park’s Elephant CenterAfterward, I visited Chitwan National Park’s elephant center where elephants are rehabilitated, breed, and recover from injuries. The second safari was an elephant walk in the grasslands of Sapana with Lucky Kali, a rescued female. This is a more ethical tourism adventure than riding the elephants which is so widely advertised. Lucky had her own mahout (handler). I helped cut the grass with a sickle for Lucky’s lunch or Kuching.Chitwan National Park Jeep TourMy third and final safari was a jeep trip through Chitwan National Park. I took a tourist ferry dugout canoe across the East Rapti River to pick up my jeep. Again, after military checkpoints, I traveled about 24 miles through the forest and elephant grass. I saw wild boar, three Indian Rhinos, Gharial crocodile, spotted deer, and peacocks. The final stop was the park’s Gharial crocodile breeding center.My return to Kathmandu was not uneventful. It’s a narrow two-lane valley/mountain road. There was an oil tanker truck that overturned and kept everyone parked for about 2.5 hours.Nepalese FoodNepalese food is spicy, and most people are vegetarians. However, I tried wild boar, water buffalo, Momo (beef dumplings), Sherpa Soup (vegetable), yak cheese, and Dal Bhat (lentils, rice, and veggies). For libation, I drank Raksi (a 60% distilled beverage which is much stronger than its hot water over millet version, Tongba), Nepal Ice lager beer, Gorkha beer, Himalaya Red beer, Chang (milky white authentic Sherpa beer), Sherpa Beer (ale, commercialized in name only), and milk tea.BhutanSaying goodbye to Nepal, I flew into Paro, Bhutan, another top extreme airport. You fly up the valleys of the Himalayas banking left than right as you come in housetop level into the airport.Facts about BhutanBhutan is the “Land of the Thunder Dragon” (Druk Yul). The fabled land of “Shangri La”. It’s a strict Buddhist country. Here you experience their “gross national happiness” (which really wasn’t that apparent) and it is definitely the safest country on the planet.Bhutan was first opened to foreigners in 1974. It is the size of New Hampshire and Vermont combined. The first vehicle arrived in 1962 with the first paved road. There is a twist in the road every 27 seconds and traffic lights are prohibited. They also drive on the left side of the road. Television came in 1999. Tobacco and plastic bags are illegal. Their currency is the Bhutan Ngultrum which runs about N70 per US dollar (2019). You get a better rate if you exchange US$100 bills than $20.Nepal is cheap compared to Bhutan. The population is about 800,000 with 60% of that under 13 years of age. There are dogs everywhere and I only saw four cats in the entire country. English is understood fairly widely here as it is their mandatory second language. No one outside Bhutan speaks Bhutanese, so English appears to be the better choice when traveling internationally for Bhutanese.Bhutan’s constitution mandates preserving 51% of its natural heritage in protected areas. Peak climbing is banned as the peaks are spiritual. Trekking on long-distance trails is allowed.Paro, BhutanAfter leaving the airport, I checked into Kangku Resort and headed off to the National Museum. I was surprised to see the extent of wood carved deity and animal masks used in their cultural dance.Below the museum is the Ta-Dzong, the watchtower over the Rinpung Dzong (monastery fortress) built in 1645 with more superb woodwork.Taktsang Monastery (Tiger’s Nest)My first full day was an adventure in endurance. I hiked 1,700 feet up a 6.5-mile trail in 7 hours to Taktsang Monastery also known as the Tiger’s Nest, located at 10,232 feet. The final section was 308 steps down and across a gorge. The approach is dangerous and slippery. The monastery clings to a sheer mountain ledge.Taktsang Monastery was founded in 1692 by a Tibetan missionary venerated as the second Buddha. Legend says he landed on the spot (a cave) from Tibet astride a flying tiger, bringing Buddhism to Bhutan. He meditated here three years, three months, three days, and three hours. It is the cultural icon of Bhutan. It was fitting to be here on this day as it was a Buddhist holiday honoring Buddha ascending to Nirvana. I ascended to this Shangri-La!Thimpu, BhutanMy hotel in Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan, was Hotel Jumolhari. After breakfast, I went behind the hotel to the Changlimithang Archery Grounds to watch archery practice. Bhutanese are noted for their archery skills. Their practice range is 459 feet. I even tried my hand at it after lunch. I wasn’t that great.Folk Heritage MuseumThe first stop of the day was the Folk Heritage Museum which preserves one of the oldest homes in Thimpu. Across the street was the National Institute for Zorig Chusum which is a government-sponsored trade school where students learn to master the many cultural artworks of Bhutan, like woodworking, pottery, embroidery, and sketching.Royal Textile Academy of BhutanThe last stop before lunch was the Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan displaying beautiful ancient and modern textiles, like wall hangings and regional clothing.Buddha DordenmaAfter lunch, I went up the mountain to Buddha Dordenma, one of the largest sitting gilded-gold Buddha’s in the world. From there, you get magnificent views of the Thimpu Valley.I had been feeling badly since I left Chitwan and my symptoms weren’t getting any better. I decided to check out their national health care system which is free to all including foreigners. I was diagnosed with Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in 1.5 hours. I received a chest x-Ray, EKG, and all my prescriptions. No cost to me. Wow, the US could really take a lesson here.At the Bhutan General Post Office, Bhutan allows you to take any photo off your iPhone and turn it into a Bhutan official postage stamp. I had two stamps made showing me at Tiger’s Nest.Punakha ValleyBack on the road for the last adventure, to Punakha Valley and the former capital of Bhutan. You drive over the 10,229-foot Dochula Pass which has a stupa with 108 miniature chortens (shrines).Just over the pass is the Royal Botanical Park administered by the Bhutan National Park System and created in 2008. It’s known for having all 49 species of rhododendron found in Bhutan. A musk deer was wandering the grounds.Chimi Lhakhang TempleI checked into the Drubchhu Resort. After lunch, I visited the Chimi Lhakhang Temple. This is a temple to a demon deity, known as the divine madman, who had overzealous behavior with women. Phallic symbols in all shapes, sizes, color, and paintings can be found for sale and most homes and businesses are adorned with phallic symbols for good luck. Hence the temple is also known as the Fertility Temple. Childless couples come here to offer prayers and are usually blessed with children. There’s a testimonial photo book in the temple.Khamsum Namgyal Chorten TempleUp the valley is the three-story Khamsum Namgyal Chorten Temple built by the Queen. It’s a bit of a climb on a trail through the terraced rice fields after crossing the Mo Chuu River on a cable bridge. As with all Buddhist temples, it had striking paintings and god effigies.Punakha DzongBack down, I had a picnic lunch at the confluence of the Mo Chuu (mother) and Phochu Chuu (father) rivers with Ruddy Shell ducks floating around. The confluence was strategically important. The Punakha Dzong (monastery fortress) was built to protect the country from invading Tibetans. It became the first capital of Bhutan and royal weddings and coronations are still held here.Tamchog Lkakhang TempleDriving back to Paro, I made a stop to view Tamchog Lkakhang Temple built by the “iron chain” monk, Thangtong Gyalpo. He built many temples and bridges made of iron chains to cross rivers. I stayed my last night at the Tashi Namgyal Resort.Leaving Bhutan, Paro’s takeoff has the plane spiral up above the airport to gain altitude to get over the Himalayas. I saw the tallest mountain in Bhutan, Gangkhar Puensum (24,836 ft.). Bidding Bhutan goodbye, I can say I hope I don’t see rice or stairs for a few months upon my return!Bhutan FoodBhutan food is also very spicy and not a lot of variety, I tried their national dish Ema Datse (extremely spicy green chilies and cheese) and red or pink rice. They really love their chilies. It’s grown and dried all over the countryside. Drinks included Lassi (yogurt), Bhutan Peach Wine, buttered tea, Red Rice beer, and Druk Supreme beer.Heading HomeArriving back in Kathmandu, I prepared for the trip home. My final dinner was at a fantastic pizza place called Fire and Ice. By the crowds and the waitlist, it appears it wasn’t a secret.A quick three-hour flight to Guangzhou, China, and I was looking forward to the McDonalds in the terminal. Sadly, a McDonalds without burgers and fries is like a bar without beer. Luckily, I got my meat fix at the nearby Burger King. Best burger ever (or at least since I left home). The next leg was 11 hours to San Francisco. I was lucky I had no rain for the entire trip (November). It was amazing the amount of Indian Hindu tourists traveling in both countries. Travel statistics for this trip were: 17,696 air miles, 39 hours in the air, 541 miles by vehicle, 127 miles on foot, and 3.5 miles in a dugout canoe. Due to the exercise and illness, I gladly lost 12 pounds Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/africa-overland/,"Africa Overland – Tour from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe",Botswana,"Once a year I try and take a trip with a group of listeners of Amateur Traveler somewhere in the world. This year we chose southern Africa and took an overland trip to South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe. We drove from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. This was a camping trip and an overland safari. Before the trip, my wife said, “this will probably be my only safari”. After the trip, she started saying things like, “when we go next time…” Let’s see if I can get you interested as well.you can also listen to Africa Overland – Johannesburg to Victoria Falls – Episode 670Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Intrepid TravelJohannesburg, South AfricaBlyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaThe Three RondavelsBourke’s Luck PotholesGod’s WindowKruger National Park, South AfricaMorning Game DriveEvening Game DriveThabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaVillage VisitMoremi Gorge, BotswanaMakgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaVictoria Falls, ZimbabweLivingstone, ZambiaWhat to PackConclusionIntrepid TravelWe had traveled previously to China, Morocco, Cambodia, and India with Intrepid Travel so we booked this trip with Intrepid as well. We have had good experiences with Intrepid with great guides every time. Our guide to Cambodia was even named the guide of the year a few years later. Intrepid has a number of overland trips in southern Africa and we chose their Kruger to Victoria Falls – 8 days/7 nights trip.Normally for these overland trips, they host groups of up to 24 in a custom made bus, but we ended up with a smaller group in a small van with a guide (Philip) and a driver (Goodman).Johannesburg, South AfricaAll the rest of our group got into Johannesburg a day early and explored the city but Joan and I spent 3 days in Capetown instead.We flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg in the early afternoon but did not do any exploring. Joan wasn’t feeling great, possibly from starting the malaria medicine that day. Our meeting hotel was the Holiday Inn Rosebank. I had stayed in Rosebank 6 months previous on the way to a Botswana safari so I knew how easy it is to get from the airport to Rosebank via the train. We hopped on the train right at the airport terminal and made one connection to get to Rosebank. The Holiday Inn is within view of the station at the Rosebank Mall. We chilled out in the room until our 6 pm meetup.We met our group and our guide Philip and driver Goodman in the hotel. The other members of our group were Pat and Lis, who had been on the Amateur Traveler India trip, and Lis’ two sons Alex and Eric. We had an early start in the morning so after our meeting, Pat and Joan and I headed into the mall for dinner and then an early bed.Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaWe met up at 4:45 for a 5 am departure so that we could get out of town before the traffic got bad. The hotel had made up breakfast bags for us with some pastries and fruit, juice and a yogurt bar. When we stopped for coffee and bathroom at a truck stop at 7:30 – the Alzu Petroport on the N4. We saw ostriches and rhinos outside as there was a small private preserve. I made sure everyone got a look as it was unlikely we would see rhinos in the wild these days.At 9:45 we stopped for groceries and food for our lunches at a SuperSpar market. Eric and Alex got a takeaway tray of meat with a side of meat from the local Wimpy Burger.Our goal the first day was to get to Kruger National Park before they closed the gate when the sunset, but on the way to Kruger we drove through the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve. Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve is not what I picture when I picture Africa. On the way to the canyon, we passed small towns with modern coffee shops and B&Bs. We past signs that that were advertising the local fishing.The Three RondavelsOur first stop was at a vista point where we could view the Three Rondavels. These rock structures remind locals of the local roundhouses or rondavels.Bourke’s Luck PotholesWe picnicked for lunch at Bourke’s Luck Potholes. Here there are some small waterfalls and the river has carved a series of kettle shaped potholes into the rock. The area is named after a prospector who predicted gold in the area… but did not find it. So presumably Bourke’s Luck was bad.God’s WindowWe drove through forests of pine trees as we drove around the canyon. Logging is a major part of the local economy. We stopped again at God’s Window to get one last view of the area before heading downhill into Kruger National Park.Kruger National Park, South AfricaAs the sun was getting low to set we entered Kruger National Park, which has 150 mammal species, 110 reptiles species, and over 500 bird species. We hoped to see the Big 5: rhino, elephant, lion, Cape Buffalo, and leopard. There are also the “Ugly 5”: wildebeest, warthog, hyena, the maribou stork, and the leopard faced buzzard.If you don’t get to the rest camp before the gates shut at sundown you will be fined. During the night and early morning hours, only the official park vehicles are allowed on the road. So we were anxious to get to the rest camp but also slowed down as we started to see animals along the side of the road.We headed to Satara Rest Camp and set up our tents as it was getting dark, with plenty of help and advice from Philip and Goodman. Philip made spaghetti Bolognese and salad for dinner, and we made it an early night. We were pleased to see that along with the sleeping bags we each got a cot, mattress, pillow, and blanket. The tents were large enough to stand up and to hold two cots and at least some of our luggage.The facilities were nicer than expected, bathroom blocks with toilet stalls and showers with wooden doors. In general, I have never seen such nice facilities at U.S. national and state parks as we did at all of our stops in Africa. Someone was always in the facilities cleaning something it seemed.Morning Game DriveWe had booked an early morning game drive so we had another early start. We were up at 4 to be picked up at 5. Philip had hot water ready for coffee and tea and rusks to dip. Rusks are like thick biscotti but made from cereal like muesli, really good. (Ouma brand recommended). Philip walked us to reception at 4:45.It was so cold that the guide gave us each a blanket. He gave 2 people on each side spotlights to shine out to spot animals. From 5 to 6 it was dark and we had no sightings. From 6-8 we saw kudu, mongoose, steenbok, and then in the last 10 minutes, we saw two lions sitting near the side of the road. Fabulous! One of the reasons you do early morning or late night drives is that you are more likely to see the carnivores like the big cats at that time. I kept track of where we had gone one our morning game drive with the maps.com iPhone app so I was able to show Goodman and Philip where we had been when we spotted the lions so we drove by that spot but did not find the lions again. We did find a large herd of cape buffalo we had seen previously and a herd of elephants complete with at least 3 very young elephants that were fascinating to watch.Back at the camp, Philip made eggs, bacon, bread, along with leftover pasta sauce. We broke camp and left for Letaba Rest Camp at around 10, watching for game along the way.We stopped at Oliphants overlook, where you look over a watering hole with elephants and hippos. We bought Kruger guide books with pictures of animals in the back that you can check off as you see them.Each of the rest camps has two maps up with magnets on them that mark where people have seen some of the animals. While rhinos are on the map, they do not mark them because this was something that poachers were using to find and kill the animals for their horns. A rhino horn will sell for $100,000 in China. Rhinos are likely to become extinct in my lifetime at the current rate of poaching.We got to camp at 3:30 and set up camp. Philip put out a fruit salad. We took a walk to the river but couldn’t see much there, sat at the restaurant and got drinks, then went to the Elephant Museum, which was really interesting. Philip made lamb chops and sausage, pap (made from maize), and corn for dinner.Evening Game DriveWe headed to reception at 7:45 for our night drive. This time Joan had one of the spotlights. In the first hour, we saw a leopard, hyena pups, and a jackal. The second hour was quieter, though we did see spring hare and scrub hare. The guide was informative and allowed time for photos.Back to camp at 10 and to bed.Departure time was at 7:15. Breakfast at 6:45 was cereal, bread, coffee.Thabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaWe headed west to Thabaphaswa (meaning ‘black and white mountain’ in the local dialect) for a farm stay. We passed by Zion Christian Church, which Goodman told us had 2.5 million people on Easter. The bishop lives in a sort of tower, and he apparently blesses and heals people. The complex was massive.We stopped at a mall for lunch. The mall could easily have been somewhere in the U.S. as it had the same design and some of the same stores.We got to the farm, which had a private reserve next door, and saw nyala, ostriches and their eggs, and monkeys. We were greeted in the driveway by our host and directed to go to the area we’d be staying. It was down a very long rocky dirt road, and when we arrived Philip assigned our rooms, which were buildings at various levels on a rocky hill, connected by cement paths and steps.Each building consisted of 2 or 4 rooms, which each had one full wall made of panes of glass with a door that matched. Each building was painted in a different color. Most had bunk beds or just two twin mattresses on the floor. We brought our sleeping bags and pillows and blankets, and just what we needed for the night, and made up our beds. We had about an hour and a half break before dinner.At 5 we drove to the main house where we sat in chairs in a circle on a patio, with our host as he described the work he has done to bring development and training young people to farm. There were 2 really nice good-sized dogs that greeted us, and another smaller one. We learned the 2 are “boerbulls”.We walked to the cattle pen. The dogs came with us but were very intimidated by the cows. Back at the house, there was now a fire in the center of the circle where we’d sat, and the host talked about the cattle. He breeds for studs and hires out their services, and he offers a cattle hotel so a new farmer can place their cow with him, breed for better offspring, and build up his farm.When Europeans came in they preferred the cattle breeds that they knew but those cattle were less suited for Africa so what they are trying to do is re-introduce the Nguni cattle that the local Bantu peoples raised. These animals are much more resistant to African diseases and the long-horned cattle can protect themselves from predators like leopards. Many a leopard had been killed by farmers trying to protect their prissy European cattle.Dinner was a traditional “braai” or BBQ, starting with a Mopani worm (cooked, crispy), sorghum beer, sausage, lamb and steak, chicken feet, spinach, Coleslaw, pap, and Chakalaka, with pudding for dessert. We could also get wine or beer for a fee.At 9:10 we said goodnight and went back to the rooms. The shower and toilet were outside within a bamboo enclosure, and hot water is provided by a “donkey boiler” which Philip kept heated by building a fire under it. We didn’t know if we’d have hot water in the morning. It was a little colder overnight in the rooms, they are probably not as airtight as the tents.We heard lions in the neighboring game reserve roaring by at least 5 am and got up at 5:30 for our 6:15 breakfast. We were pleased to have hot water for showers, but we still made them very quick as we were outside and the air was very cold. We packed up and met at the van where Philip and Goodman had cereal and tea and coffee ready.Village VisitOur host drove over and we followed his truck. At one point we stopped and he came and explained that we were in the “Platinum belt” and told us about underground and above-ground mining. One of his workers got in our van to go to the village with us to translate.At about 8:30 we arrived at the village for our visit. The buildings are similar to what I see when I do volunteer work in Tijuana, made of cinder block and no indoor toilets. A man from the village was somehow designated to be our guide, and Goodman actually did some translating, and a young man from the village also came over and did the bulk of the initial translation.The man we were visiting with owned a store, so we saw how it is set up, very neat, snacks, dry goods, and also meat. His bedroom is in the same building, and that is the entire building. He also grows vegetables to sell. He showed us his peanut plants and we tried raw peanuts, which tasted like beans. The young man we met had just finished school for mechanical engineering and was looking for an internship, which he said is the typical career starting point. We learned that typically a small percentage of the people in the village works in the mines, and the rest of the people work in support services. They do make their own houses, there is a community cement mixer to make the blocks.One of the things that I like about Intrepid tours is that they usually involve some sort of community connection. It might be visiting a rehabilitation center as we did in Morocco or a village as we did in Cambodia or South Africa.We left the village at around 9:15 and made a stop around 10:10-10:30 to pick up drinks. We drove into Botswana and got to our campsite at Moremi Gorge at around 1:45. We set up camp while Philip made tuna salad and fruit salad for lunch.Moremi Gorge, BotswanaWe started a hike of the Moremi Gorge around 3:30 with an intro and information about a large baobab tree. Philip had already shown us the inside of the fruit, which is hard and which is where we get cream of tartar.We selected walking sticks to use on the hike and got started. The hike crosses a stream river several times, so the sticks were to help keep our balance while walking on rocks. We saw a dassie, and our guide identified several plants including a broom cluster fig and a rock scrambling fig. We saw a plant with a hole dug under it, and the guide said that if a porcupine eats the roots of a plant, it is safe for humans to eat that plant.To complete the hike, we had to climb on boulders that had cables or sections of garden hose attached, definitely more strenuous than we had expected. But we all managed it both up and down. Just before we got to the last waterfall the cables went away and we had to climb around a set of boulders an uncomfortable height off the ground.The waterfalls were very pretty. The hike back was much faster, which was good as it would be getting dark soon. Somehow stepping over the rocks in the stream and all the other aspects of the hike seemed much easier after the bouldering portion. Philip drove us back to camp and made Philip’s Surprise, basically chicken burritos. He had also provided ingredients for a variation on s’mores, with Nutella and Marie’s biscuits in place of chocolate and Graham crackers. They were actually very good!Alex and Eric had bought some cane alcohol, and the campsite actually had a tall counter with a sink which made the perfect bar. Pat had bought wine, and we shared our Port from Stellenbosch.While the rest of us had hiked the gorge, Alex had stayed at the camp, and when we got back he showed us photos of the zebra that had been wandering through the campsite while we were gone. The zebra actually hung around and was just in the trees later in the evening as well.Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaWe were up showering at 5:30. We broke camp, had breakfast at 6:45 and were on our way by about 7:30 to drive to Nata. We had a quick bathroom/fuel stop, and a shopping stop from 10:30-11:15, in a really nice SuperSpar market.We got to the Nata rest camp and set up camp. We had a drive scheduled out onto the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. On the drive, we saw jackals, helicopter birds, ostriches, wildebeests, kori bustards, and zebra.At the salt pan, we saw a huge number of flamingoes in the sunset. In fine African tradition, the numerous vehicles from the rest camp brought coolers of beer and other drinks for a traditional “sundowner”.Philip made poiki for dinner, a traditional stew with kudu meat, made in a dutch oven over the fire.After dinner, Philip took us for a quick walk into the dark around our campsite to find bush babies. Bushbabies are one of the smallest and cutest primates. We only had to look in a few trees before we saw their large eyes staring down at us.Victoria Falls, ZimbabweWe packed up camp and headed out around 7:15 am to head to Victoria Falls. We got to Victoria Falls Rest Camp around 1:30, and Philip and Goodman said they would set up camp for us. (Yay!) We had lunch at the restaurant at the camp, “in Da Belly”. You have to love a restaurant with croc, warthog, and impala on the menu.The camp was right in town, unlike our other camps so far.Philip drove us to the Falls, where we had a guided tour of the viewing point. We were glad that Philip had advised us to wear rain gear and sandals as we definitely got wet. There are more than a dozen different viewing spots and the half to the right get more and more wet. At one it was basically like being in a driving rain.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-928fc4R/0/f68e5013/1280/IMG_6852-1280.mp4The Falls are spectacular, with a rainbow visible for much of the walk, at times a double rainbow. The tour lasted about 2 hours, though you could do it in less.Philip had made reservations at Pariah State, a restaurant close to the camp, at 7. The restaurant was really good. We split a spinach and feta pizza and a chocolate dessert. Joan tried Zambezi beer, Chris had a cider. The entire bill for the 2 of us was $22.We were able to have a later start on the last day, with breakfast around 8. Philip and Goodman kindly took down our tents, before they packed up to drive the van back to Johannesburg. You can normally book this trip either one way as we did or round trip which takes 14+ days and visits some other great sites on the way back to Johannesburg like the Okavango Delta and the Khama Rhino Sanctuary.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-ZRjQWKx/0/3f0480f4/4K/IMG_2191-4K.jpgWe said our goodbyes and put our luggage in storage, and then went with Lis and Alex and Eric to the market in town to look at handicrafts. It was quite an experience, with many vendors all with very similar wooden and stone artwork and lots of haggling and even bartering. Lis gave one of the vendors things from her purse like a tape measure and nail clippers.One of the reasons that people were trying to barter with us for our shirts, shoes, and nicknacks is that Zimbabwe’s economy is quite screwed up after they had runaway hyperinflation. Over 90% of the country are out of work and it is a wonder that the country still functions. But the people we met were friendly, the crafts were great and I was glad we could buy some to take home.Livingstone, ZambiaJoan and I wanted to visit Zambia which is just over the bridge from Victoria Falls. We said our goodbyes, went back to the camp and got a cab for $5 to the border. There we exited Zimbabwe and walked between the two borders, which included crossing the bridge, with additional walking before and after the bridge. It was farther than we expected. At the Zambia side, we got in a line to enter and were behind a group that we thought were also tourists. It was moving slowly if at all, and after about 5 min someone in a uniform came over and told us there were 2 lines and we should be in the other line, which was for tourists. That was much shorter and it went quickly from there.We then got a cab into Livingstone, the town across the border. We shared it with someone and it was about $10 each. On the way, we talked to both the driver and our fellow passenger about Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zambia is doing much better than Zimbabwe due to its better government for the last few decades.The driver and other passenger gave us recommendations for what to do in Livingstone, but since we didn’t have much time, and the crossing had taken longer than we expected, we just got lunch and didn’t try to see more of town.We got a cab back to the border for $10, as listed on a price list the driver showed us, then got a taxi that goes from border to border to avoid the long walk, and then a third cab to the Vic Falls Rest Camp. We had time to sit at the restaurant and have a soda and iced tea before getting our luggage out and waiting for our driver from the Old Drift Lodge to pick us up for our next adventure.What to PackSouth Africa, Botswana Travel Adapter Plug – the right adapter for Southern AfricaOutlet Travel Power Strip Surge Protector with 4 Smart USB Charging Ports – a small surge protector to plug in more things1004 Luci Lux Warm Frosted Decor Light – a collapsable solar lantern for your tentheadlamp – a good headlamp will let you be hands-free in your tentAlso, see What to Pack for a Mobile African Safari for a more detail list.ConclusionIt was interesting seeing Africa, or this corner of Africa at least from ground level on an overland tour. The countries are of a good size so there is a lot of driving on this trip, but there was something interesting to do every day. I would love to go back and do one of the other tours that Intrepid has in southern Africa. I would try and see if we could get Goodman and Philip again if I could!One other surprise is that the trip sounded like our wildlife experiences would mainly be in Kruger National Park. We certainly had great wildlife encounters there, but we also would just see elephants or giraffes or zebra crossing the road some times. The stretch of road from Botswana to Zimbabwe is called the Elephant Highway. Much of it is inside the national parkland.As with all road trips, the most important thing is great traveling companions and, like every other Amateur Traveler trip, we were richly blessed in that regard.See all my Africa photosShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/jacks-camp-botswana/,Jack’s Camp – Botswana – Luxury Safari Camp in the Kalahari Desert,Botswana,"In 1869, American journalist Henry Morton Stanley set out for Africa in search of the British explorer and missionary David Livingstone who had lost contact with the outside world for at least 4 years by that time. They finally met on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871 where Stanley greeted him famously with “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?” I had not found Livingstone on my safari experience in Botswana… but I feel like I found his camp.If you want to feel like an explorer from Victorian England, Jack’s Camp in Botswana’s Kalahari Desert maybe the place for you.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}The TentThe CampThe AreaActivities at Jack’s CampGame DrivesSundowner on the Salt FlatsCamping Out in the Salt FlatsATV Riding in the Salt FlatsHorseback Riding or BikingKalahari Bushmen EncounterMeerkat EncounterThe TentJack’s Camp is an off the grid safari experience. There is no cell signal and no internet. While there is a place to recharge your electronics in the main dining tent, at night your tent is lit with lanterns. Each of the ten tents in the camp is decorated with East African furniture including a 4 poster bed or two, a writing desk, a chest of drawers, a trunk or two.Not only did it look like it might be Stanley’s camp or Livingstone’s, my tent included a copy of Stanley’s book “How I Found Livingstone; travels, adventures, and discoveries in Central Africa, including an account of four months’ residence with Dr. Livingstone” in a collection of books on the dresser.There was an electric fan that you could use during the daytime when the generator was running. This being a desert, there was no need for a fan at night even in December at the beginning of Botswana’s summer.A small box on one of the trunks held insect repellent, sunscreen, and an air horn… the latter being a bit more disconcerting as we heard the sound of a lion roaring from nearby at night.I was coming off a 7-day mobile safari in the Okavango Delta. The camp did not have a pack of African wild dogs like I had seen there, but it did have indoor plumbing. What looks like a chair and writing desk in the bathroom area opens up into a flush toilet and sink. There is a shower inside as well as a second one outside. This is not camping as you did in the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts.The tent not only had plush towels but a traditional shawl-like cloth from Kenya called a Kikoi that you could wet and wear to keep you cool in the heat of the day.The CampWe flew to Jack’s Camp from Maun on a small plane and were greeted at the landing strip by Ossy who would be our safari guide for the rest of our two-night stay.He drove us 15 minutes to the camp where we were greeted by what seemed like everyone on the camp staff. This is a small intimate experience where you get to know the staff by name and eat at a common table in the dining tent with guides and the other guests who you also get to know.The dining tent is the central social meeting place in the camp. The tent has a large common dining area. This is where you will take your meals. People come and go from meals as they come and go from various activities rather than eating all at exactly the same time. The food, as you would expect, was excellent. In addition to breakfast, lunch, and dinner the afternoon tea is no small production, basically the 4th meal.To one side of the dining area is a small pool table as well as a fully-stocked open bar and a fridge with cold drinks.To the other side of the dining table is a library, seating area, and place to recharge your electronics. You are in the middle of nowhere with a small select group of people so people would just leave there smartphone or laptop sitting here with no fear of theft. There are seating areas in the front of the tent where people can just hang out, read a book, or chat with their fellow travelers.Surrounding the dining area in every nook and cranny are museum display cases with artifacts and exhibits about Botswana’s wildlife, African explorers and the native bushmen. Jack’s Camp was founded by Jack Bousfield in the 1960s and the collection is the Bousfield family collection of artifacts.There is a plunge pool in a nearby tent that is unheated and therefore chilly and/or refreshing. There is another fridge with cold drinks at one end and a massage area at the other. The tent is mostly open with views of zebras grazing on the nearby fields.The Area            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/JacksCamp.kmz"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(8);    });  }Jack’s Camp is near located on a private concession near the Makgadikgadi Pans National Park and not far from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in central Botswana. Botswana’s Makgadikgadi Pans is a salt pan the size of the country of Switzerland. It is 1,900 square miles of flat and white and lifeless.The area just around the camp is savanna. The camp has dug some watering holes to make the area attractive to life all year round, but the area also gets 50,000 zebra and wildebeest that migrate through the area from January to April. This is the rainy season for Botswana and the area turns lush, green and wet with flocks of migrating birds including flamingos as well. We were there in December when the rains had just started and some of the zebra herds were starting to arrive.The company behind Jack’s Camp, Natural Selection, runs two other camps in the immediate area. We toured one of these camps and it is also lovely if with a little less 1800 century explorer vibe.Activities at Jack’s CampGame DrivesAs is common with safari camps, morning and afternoon noon game drives are a typical experience. We saw one of a pair of male lion brothers who are the alpha males in the area as well as herds of zebra and wildebeest, ostriches, and impala.We also did a game drive after dark with the aid of a spotlight on the vehicle where we spotted some nocturnal animal activity like this shy porcupine.Sundowner on the Salt FlatsOne activity that just made me laugh out loud was when we pulled up to the edge of the salt flats at sundown to see a small camp set up for our daily sundowner drink.You know you are on a luxury experience when you find a fully stocked bar on the edge of a salt flat the size of Switzerland. While a gin and tonic is the traditional drink, for the record, I had a rum drink. The tradition was to drink quinine in the tonic water to help prevent Malaria and gin helped that drink be more palatable. But… I was taking Malarone as a malaria prophylactic and… there did not seem to be a mosquito for miles.Camping Out in the Salt FlatsATV Riding in the Salt FlatsTwo typical activities that were not available during our visit because the rains had started were taking ATVs out into the salt flats or doing an overnight camping out in the salt flat, miles from any light, for great stargazing.Horseback Riding or BikingOther guests took advantage of the opportunity to go horseback riding or biking while we were at the camp, but with a two-night stay you don’t have time to try every activity offered.Kalahari Bushmen EncounterOne of the more unique experiences at Jack’s camp is an opportunity to spend time with a group of Kalahari bushmen (and women). The camp hires a group to stay with them for 3-4 months at a time and present a cultural experience to their guests. They have built a replica of a traditional campsite near the camp which is where we had our visit.A number of the group spoke fluent English and acted as interpreters because some of the information was presented in the distinctive clicking language of the bushmen.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Kalahari-Desert-Jacks-Camp/i-XDFksZ6/0/4cc52a9c/1280/MVI_2979-1280.mp4The group demonstrated some of their traditional games like this one where the player has to keep the rhythm as he passes his hand between two rocks being beaten together. Notice that he is not even looking to see if his hand is going to get smashed.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Kalahari-Desert-Jacks-Camp/i-Gh5KC3q/0/7b1c5ead/1280/MVI_2981-1280.mp4Another game was a version of jump rope. Even my host Bill Burns of Botswana Trek took part.We then took a walk as they explained the traditional uses for nearby plants and trees, including which caterpillar from which tree they used to create the deadly poison that they used to dip their arrows in to hunt for big game.It was a fascinating experience and also decent employment for the bushmen.Meerkat EncounterThe best experience we had at Jack’s Camp though would still have to be the time we spent with local meerkats.Jack’s camp hires 7 men to track local meerkat colonies. These colonies are wild but habituated to the presence of humans. In a meerkat colony, only the alpha male and alpha female breed and all the other adult meerkats assist with raising the young. If some eagle snatches away one of the alpha animals then the men who the camp employs will direct tourists away from that group until they can attract a new alpha male or female, so that the presence of tourists does not disrupt that process.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Kalahari-Desert-Jacks-Camp/i-79n9r5V/0/7ef98866/1280/MVI_2889-1280.mp4We watched for a while as the various meerkats would roam further into grasslands digging for something yummy like a beetle.One of the meerkats would always be on the lookout for predators.The surprise came for us after the meerkats were done with their foraging and returned to the mouth of one of their tunnels. Ossy sat down nearby and one of the meerkats quickly climbed up on him to use him as a better lookout spot. Meerkat researchers discovered this behavior by accident and I can imagine their surprise… since we had that same reaction.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Kalahari-Desert-Jacks-Camp/i-VKr7dCz/0/eecfdb04/1280/IMG_4818%202-1280.mp4We were encouraged that if we were to stand near to Ossy but be just a little taller, that the lookout would take advantage of this improved perch and before you know it… I had a meerkat on my head. I did expect animal encounters in Botswana… but I did not expect this.Starting at ~$1250 per person per night, Jack’s Camp is not for everyone, but if you have the means it can make a nice stop after a mobile safari or even as a honeymoon destination.See all my pictures from Jack’s Camp.I was on this safari as a guest of Botswana Trek which can find the right Botswana safari for you.Share this: "

Have you sat 15 feet away while it uses this improbably useful flexible appendage to pull up the local grass and eat it? I suggest you try this sometime. They are a fascinating animal. They are the kind of animal that would be hard to convince the product review committee was a particularly good idea. “How’s that again?”, they would ask, “you want to design an animal with a, particularly large and snake-like nose that it will eat with? That’s never going to make it out of the focus groups.” That idea, like your idea about an animal with a particularly long neck, would be doomed to the dustbin of product ideas.But darned if someone did not design both of those animals… and He put a fair number of them in northern Botswana in the Okavango Delta. In fact, fully one-third of Africa’s elephants can be found in the Okavango.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}The Okavango DeltaMobile Safari CampBest time to visit BotswanaGame DrivesAnimal EncountersThe Safari VehicleCostsPodcastThe Okavango DeltaThe Okavango Delta in Botswana is an interesting phenomenon. It is an inland delta. It does not drain into any lake, sea or ocean but basically drains the rivers that flow down from the Angolan highlands into the Kalahari desert. The whole area is lush as the water brings life to it. The area used to be a large ancient lake, but after the Chobe and Zambezi rivers redirected, the area turned into this out of place delta. 90% of the water that flows into the Okavango either soaks into its sandy soil or evaporates from his shallow waterways.I was in the Okavango as a guest of Bill Burns from Botswana Trek. Bill fell in love with Botswana 28 years ago as a young teacher with the Peace Corps and now brings groups to the area.We camped in the Khwai Concession which is a community-owned conservation area instead of one of Botswana’s many National Parks. On the way there we drove through a corner of the Chobe National Park in an area along the river with a stunning variety of life. We saw wildebeests, zebras, hippos, crocodiles, gazelle, and waterbuck. And all that was just the first day.We are exploring the area not from a luxury safari lodge but from a different form of luxury in the form of a mobile (that is to say camping) safari.Mobile Safari CampI woke to a friendly “good morning”, but there were few signs of the morning and it would take me a while to evaluate “good” at 4:30 am. A member of the safari crew had unzipped the back porch area on my tent to bring me a fresh warm basin of water so I could wash up before our morning game drive.My tent had an awning in the front of it and in the back of it, there was a private area with a suspended bag of water for a shower, a basin and a simple pit toilet covered with a toilet seat. Beside the toilet was a bucket of sand and a trowel that I would use to “flush”.Inside my tent, many of the vents were still opened to let in the breeze as I was in Botswana in December which was the beginning of the hot rainy part of the year and it was already shirt-sleeve weather at 4:30 am. There was a comfortable camp bed with bedding, including two monogrammed pillows that said Royale Wilderness, which was the name of the mobile safari operator who was showing me the Okavango delta area of Botswana.Both the inside of the tent and the back porch area have an LED light that is connected to a large battery that should last for the whole week we are out in the bush.We have a dining tent nearby where we eat our meals. This safari comes with a chef and the food is plentiful and tasty. The only problem I had with dinner was trying to keep the staff from endlessly filling my wine glass.Best time to visit BotswanaThe rains started in the afternoon as the heat of the day broke. I woke to thunder from a quick power nap between the morning and evening outing. December is supposed to be the rainy part of the year. Temperatures are warmer this time of year (hitting over 100°F or 40°C during the heat of the day) as well so there are fewer tourists out on safari. The rains have come late this year so animals and humans alike will be glad for this downpour if tourists are a bit more inconvenienced. As the rains have come a parade of at least 100 elephants from different groups has paraded past our camp heading in the direction of the lightning and the refreshing rain.This is a good time of year for birders as the migratory birds are coming back from their summer in Europe. Over 450 different species of birds visit or inhabit the Okavango Delta area. Of course, it is good to note that one reason that the birds want to come to this area in the wet season is that as soon as the rains hit the many many termite mounds, the mounds open up and disgorge flying termites which will mate and found new colonies… or will become lunch to some migrating bird. Flying ants will also come out and one morning after a rain, the flying ants sounded like rain on the side of my tent as they swarmed around the outside light.Most tourists come in Botswana winter which is colder and dryer. This early December safari will be the last one that Royale Wilderness will do for a few months. The hot summer months can become to wet to get around much of the Delta so it is a time for the guides and crew to take vacations and for refitting for the next safari season.Game DrivesThe typical schedule is to get up before sunrise, eat breakfast in the pre-dawn and head out of a game drive in the early morning light. Herds of herbivores are easy to find but most of the carnivores are more active at night or in the early morning or late afternoon light.We would drive around in our safari vehicle as our guide Johnny Ramsden would lean out of the vehicle to read the tracks left the night before (like the rhino tracks pictured above). He wanted to see those tracks before other safari vehicles would drive over them to know which direction to head to find lions for instance. Johnny and his wife Tasha own Royale Wilderness. Johnny still does some of the guide work while Tasha does all the hard work of keeping the company running.Mid-morning we would find a place to park and have our morning tea. Johnny would set out the tea, coffee, and biscuits on a fold-down table in the front of the vehicle while we enjoyed watching some hippo pool or herd of elephants.We would then continue the game drive until around 10 am or 10:30 am when we would return to camp. The middle of the day would be a break for lunch, naps, editing photos, telling stories or catching up on that book you had been meaning to read. We were out past cellular or wi-fi signals so you bring your own entertainment with you.In the afternoon we would have tea around 4 and then get back in the vehicle for a second game drive until just after sunset. We would find some pack of lions or wild dogs (see Hunting with African Wild Dogs on Safari in Botswana’s Okavango Delta) and watch them as they woke up and headed out to hunt.In fine safari tradition, we would stop for a “sundowner” drink and watch the sunset. The traditional drink would be a gin and tonic (the tonic meant to help prevent malaria) but mine was as often a glass of red wine or a Diet Coke.As we lost our light we would return to camp for dinner.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Moremi-Wildlife-Reserve/i-dDMKmkv/0/4ef7068a/1280/MVI_2584-1280.mp4We camped at Khwai for 3 nights and then repositioned to the Moremi Wildlife Reserve for another 3 nights. One the days that the camp is being broken down, transported and set up we would continue to drive through the middle of the day, stopping for lunch somewhere along the way. A typical game drive is around 10 days, changing locations about once every 3 days.Animal Encountershttps://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Khwai-Consession/i-wRgKXZ9/0/ad27bbef/1280/IMG_4714-1280.mp4We had an up-close encounter with a bull elephant that ambled up to our safari vehicle just to get a good look at us. He definitely seemed more interested than upset, as if we were also the highlight of his day.One morning game drive was the Okavango version of “uneventful”. We watched a mother giraffe and a juvenile, but we were trying to find carnivores. After a few hours, we spotted a leopard… no pun intended. We watched a mother leopard for at least half an hour as we crashed through the underbrush in the vehicle at times, to get to where she would pass by. She seemed unconcerned by our presence and would walk directly in front of the vehicle at times.After our coffee break, we heard news on the radio that her daughter had joined her and continued to watch the pair as mom tried to encourage the daughter to get a place of her own. It was time for this one and a half-year-old juvenile to establish her own territory before the mom would have her next offspring in about 6 months.Besides the African wild dog encounter which rated its own blog post, we lions rise from their nap and start the hunt. One group of 3 sisters included a lioness who had injured her paw and was no longer able to keep up with the pride. If her paw did not heal quickly then she would stand little chance of survival,We heard lioness roar on another occasion, just outside our camp. We sat by the fire as she strolled by 50 feet away in search of the rest of her pride.We spent quite a lot of time trying to identify some of the many species of birds that visit the Okavango Delta in a year. Some of these are locals and some tourists coming from as far away as northern Europe.The Safari VehicleThe typical safari vehicle in Botswana is a highly customized Toyota pickup truck that has been modified to add 8 tiered seats in the back. Royale Wilderness will never take more than 7 guests in the vehicle at a time even though that leaves 2 middle seats empty. There are no windows and even the windshield is usually folded down so this is a bumpy, dusty ride.Our morning game drive started a little late one day as one of our group had dehydrated the day before and was ill. As you drive for hours in the open vehicle you can stay cool with the breeze and not realize how much you are dehydrating. So you keep your water bottle near you. This vehicle also had a fridge with cold drinks that the crew kept stocked and places to plug in your electronics to recharge them.CostsThis is not basic camping. When you leave your dirty clothes on the floor of your tent they come back laundered. Dinners are much better than any camping outing where I was in charge of the cooking.Prices for a safari with Royale Wilderness start at about $360 per person per day. Each group is a private group. It is the kind of “once in a lifetime experience” you hope to have more than once in a lifetime.PodcastFor more information about Botswana listen to the only episode of the Amateur Traveler podcast which I have ever had interrupted by a lion: Botswana Safari – Amateur Traveler #639See also:What to Pack for a Mobile African SafariHunting with African Wild Dogs on Safari in Botswana’s Okavango DeltaI was on this safari as a guest of Botswana Trek which can find the right Botswana safari for you.</em Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/safari-packing-list/,Safari Packing List – What to Pack for a Mobile African Safari,Botswana,"I was just on a mobile Safari in Africa in Botswana and wanted to summarize what I learned about what to bring from that experience. I started with a packing list from Royale Wilderness who was the operator I went with.Royale Wilderness‘s great crew would pick up dirty clothes off the floor of my tent and launder it. Double-check with your operator to see if that is offered or you may need additional clothing.Royale Wilderness told me that they did not wash underwear, but in my experience, they did wash out cotton boxers, but you may want to wear something that is easily washed out like boxers or a low maintenance travel brand like ExOfficio.During the heat of the day, shorts were more comfortable, especially in late Spring and Summer. During the evening when bugs and maybe the mosquitoes come out you will want long pants and a long sleeve shirt or jacket.Royale Wilderness recommended jeans because they provide better protection if you are doing a bushwalk, which may not be included in your mobile safari. Check with your operator.Safari clothing for women2 or 3 pairs of long pants (Preferably Jeans)2 or 3 pairs of Short pants or skirts if preferred2 or 3 T-shirts1 or more long sleeve shirtsSports Bras for ladies (the country roads are very bumpy)Safari clothing for men2 or 3 pairs of long pants (Preferably Jeans), I brought travel pants.2 or 3 pairs of Short pants2 or 3 T-shirts1 or more long sleeve shirtsSafari OuterwearI was in Botswana in early December which is the start of their rainy season and the beginning of their Summer. We woke up at 4:30 am and the temperature was shirtsleeve weather. I never needed a coat. During the heat of the day, it got up to over 100°F or 40°C. The winter is the more popular safari season in southern Africa, and it will be cold when you wake up. During the heat of the day, it will be shirtsleeve weather.1 Windbreaker or rain gear (Summer)1 or 2 sweaters (Winter)A Heavy Jacket (Winter)A wide brim hat with a string (summer) – A typical safari vehicle is open-air so the string will keep that hat from flying awayA beanie and scarf (winter)a buff or scarf – As you drive on dirt roads something you can pull over your nose and mouth quickly to keep out the dust is very usefulSafari FootwearAnkle-high leather boots (you won’t need these for a mobile safari but will want them if you are doing a bushwalk. Check with your operator)Slippers or Sandals (A mobile safari camp may be pitched near Acacia trees with their thorns. This can poke through canvas so we were encouraged to wear sandals even to just go in the back porch of our tent to use the facilities.Safari GearA typical mobile safari schedule is to get up before dawn and do an early morning game drive and then to take a break in the middle of the day from around 10 am to 4 pm before an afternoon game drive. So you will have some time on your hands.Books to readiPad/iPodA pair or 2 of SunglassesLots of sunscreenInsect repellent with Deet, I used a small sportsman stickA small Medical kitAnti Malaria tablets (I recommend Malarone but please consult your physician about best possible drugs)A pair of Binoculars (8-30mm is fine for general game viewing, 10-50mm recommended for birding), binoculars with night vision would be interesting to have alongheadlamp – a good headlamp will let you be hands-free in your tentsmall LED flashlight – when we were out in the bush at night I was trying to use the flashlight on my iPhone and was envious of the people who had brought a much brighter compact flashlighthand sanitizer, tissues, wipes – You will be out in the bush for hours at a time. Restroom breaks will be taken by going behind the vehicle to “check the tires”. Plan accordingly.Safari Camera EquipmentI brought a digital SLR because I wanted to possibly sell some photographs as stock photography, but my point and shoot camera with a good zoom would also have worked fine for personal use (see Finding The Best Camera for Travel Photography).I brought an 18-250mm Lens which worked great for shots of animals (see Botswana photos), but for birders, you will want a bit more zoom like an 18-400mm.A monopod to steady the camera if you have a zoom, especially for videoExtra memory cardsLaptop/external hard drive (Optional)Powering ElectronicsIt is not likely that your safari camp will be running a generator so find out what capability there will be to recharge electronic devices. The Royale Wilderness vehicle has a second battery in the vehicle which is used to power a fridge to keep drinks cold and also to recharge electronics. I brought more external batteries than I needed, but ask your operator what plug type you will need. It might be a cigarette lighter adapter instead. Also how many of them. The fewer there are the more you might want an extra external battery.  That might also make the difference between reading books on an iPad or eBook reader vs a paper book.Extra batteriesAn adapter for your battery chargersCigarette lighter charging adapterSouth Africa, Botswana Travel Adapter PlugI was on this safari as a guest of Botswana Trek which can find the right Botswana safari for you.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/african-wild-dogs-safari/,"Hunting with African Wild Dogs on Safari in Moremi Game Reserve, Botswana’s Okavango Delta",Botswana,"https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Moremi-Wildlife-Reserve/i-X3Kn5V8/0/7d22f9b8/1280/MVI_2714-1280.mp4 We bounced along the dirt “roads” of the Moremi Game Reserve trying to keep up with the pack of wild dogs. Royale Wilderness owner, safari guide and formula one fan Johnny Ramsden was in hot pursuit and in the back of the safari vehicle I would occasionally find myself airborne. We clung to cameras, thanked god for hats with tie strings that kept them from flying out of the vehicle and wondered once again whether seat belts might be, after all, a not entirely bad idea.African Wild Dog HabitatOnly a few minutes previously we had been sitting in our heavily modified Toyota Land Cruiser safari vehicle lazily watching a pack of around 35 African wild dogs as they stretched and woke from their naps in their natural habitat. The heat of the day was gone and the pack was likely to go on one last hunt before dark. There was only one other vehicle around which belonged to a wildlife photographer from cheetahman.com. We had encountered Cheetahman earlier in the day and let him know about this pack. Safari guides routinely share information with other guides because the Moremi Game Reserve is a huge part of the Okavango Delta area (just under 5,000 square kilometers or 1,900 square miles) and finding a particular pride of lions, rhino or pack of wild dogs is not simple.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Moremi-Wildlife-Reserve/i-r59wGFv/0/3de41586/1280/MVI_2704-1280.mp4African Wild Dogs HuntingAn African wild dog pack is the most effective predator in Africa. When the pack hunts, there is an 85% chance that some animal is going to find itself on the wrong end of the food chain. Even hunting as a pride, lions are only 30% effective by comparison. It is hard to picture these as killing machines when you watch them play like puppies and greet one another with their impossibly high pitched yelps that sound like someone is playing the video at the wrong speed or that the dogs have been breathing helium.Safaris in Africa and more specifically in Botswana are like this. An hour and a half of “ho hum” and “how cute” can quickly be followed by fifteen minutes of “oh my god, oh my god!”While the pack was looking for larger prey like a juicy impala, an unfortunate scrub hare caught their attention and was quickly dispatched by a couple of members of the pack.In the middle of the chase, Cheetahman’s vehicle got stuck on one of the stream crossings and Johnny broke off the chase long enough to pull him out. You have to come to someone’s aid if they need it because there is no auto club to call nor even any cell phone service to call them with. Johnny carried a satellite phone and had a crew back at our campsite with a truck that could come to our aid if we got stuck (and did one night on our trip when we were tracking a pride of 7 lionesses) but a solo vehicle operator could be stuck until someone happens to come along… if someone happens to come along.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Moremi-Wildlife-Reserve/i-CBn8dHD/0/0aa0bd15/1280/MVI_2726-1280.mp4Our Good Samaritan duties fulfilled, we were back on the chase and caught up with the pack just in time to see it corner a group of a dozen adult and 3 juvenile wildebeests. The wildebeests formed a circle around their young with their horns out to fend off the dogs. The dogs were trying to get the animals to panic and run but the wildebeests were having none of it. If the dogs kept this up, one of them was likely to become a casualty so they broke off and raced after a herd of impala.Impala is the fast food of Botswana, the 4th fastest animal on the planet. They can run around 90 km/h (56 mph) for short bursts, can make 9 m (10 yds) jumps and can quickly change course. A single impala can probably outrun a single wild dog… but this was a pack. We watched as the pack went after one impala that was fast enough to escape but the next impala was less lucky. We saw them start the chase, but by the time we cleared the next small hill a few seconds later the chase was done and the impala was being torn apart. All thoughts of how cute a wild dog is are set aside when you see their blood cover muzzles tear into their prey.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Botswana/Moremi-Wildlife-Reserve/i-GqD9WDB/0/8f6d65c8/640/MVI_2729-640.mp4This is the time when Johnny says some tourists want to suddenly head back to camp. This is the part of the Circle of Life that they left out of the Lion King.I was on this safari as a guest of Botswana Trek which can find the right Botswana safari for you.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/botswanas-african-safari-treasures/,What to Do and See in Botswana,Botswana,"There are many safari destinations that will offer you great adventures, but none of them can be compared to Botswana’s. Over the years, Botswana has been regarded as one of the best places for wildlife adventures. Here’s a look into Botswana’s great treasures.The annual zebra migration in Savute and Linyantiflickr.com/amanderson2Bordering the Chobe National Park and located just above the Okavango Delta is the Savuti and Linyanti area. It is a remote region of Botswana consisting of grasslands, swamps, sandy plains, and is the famous site of the amazing annual zebra migration.The zebras stay in the Linyanti area during winter and head to Savuti by late November in anticipation of the summer rains which happen between December-March. What makes the annual zebra migration popular and very much anticipated by tourists is because, during this event, they get a chance to experience a superb viewing of the wild-life in person. There are several hides available around the area for guests to use in order to have an exclusive and close-up viewing of the migration. The staggering view of the zebras together with animals running from Linyanti to Savuti will surely leave you astounded.The Okavango Deltaflickr.com/justinHighly regarded as “the jewel” of the Kalahari Desert, the Okavango Delta is an isolated oasis located at the arid desert of Botswana. Okavango Delta is sought after by tourists because of its exemplary flora and fauna diversity. This area of Botswana can be explored through canoes, boats or nature walks.Chobe National Parkflickr.com/ObliotChobe National Park is perhaps Botswana’s best destination for game and elephant viewing. Even though parts of Chobe National Park can be crowded with tourists, it is still the prime safari destination because it is home to an exciting variety of more than 600 bird species and giant mammals. The park is probably best known for its elephants. With over 50,000 elephants it is one of the easiest places in Africa to see elephants. The population of elephants has grown from a few thousand elephants in 1990 and is a testament to the conservation efforts in Botswana.The Big Five and other game viewing animalsflickr.com/jurvetson“The Big Five” is a term coined by hunters referring to Africa’s 5 of the most difficult animals to hunt on foot, namely the African Elephant, the Black rhinoceros, cape buffalo, lion, and leopard. Even though hunting is not allowed in Botswana parks, many tourists still keep track of how many of these animals they shoot, although now they are shooting them with their cameras. There are many places in Botswana where you can have an up-close and personal look of them together with other animals such as wildebeests, hyenas, and zebras.A diverse bird speciesflickr.com/Stig NygaardBotswana is truly a bird’s paradise with more than 600 bird species which makes it a perfect place for bird-viewing adventures. Okavango plains is a breathtaking spot where you can see a dazzling array of bird species including the three most popular: Wattled Crane, Slaty Egret, and Pel’s Fishing Owl.World Heritage Site of the Tsodilo Hillswikipedia.orgTsodilo is a UNESCO World Heritage site found at the north-eastern part of Botswana. Tsodilo is highly regarded for the rock paintings that can be found all over the area left by humans who lived in Africa thousands of years ago. With more than 4,500 paintings in a relatively small area (10 square km) the area has been called the ‘Louvre of the Desert’.The Kalahari Desertflickr.com/untipograficoThe Kalahari “Desert” is an area of semi-arid savannah covering the hollow basin of Botswana. The area gets only  3–7.5 inches or rain per year and 4,000 hours of sunlight. The area includes vast grasslands as well as acacia trees and over 400 kinds of plants have adapted to its harsh environment. The Kalahari Bushmen which have inhabited this area fr perhaps as long as 20,000 years.In SummaryBotswana’s natural wonders aided by its’ government’s strong commitment to boost their travel industry has made the country a top destination in Africa. This means that the country is geared towards giving its tourists a great experience through the best services that they can offer.

https://amateurtraveler.com/wwoofing-learning-to-make-cheese-in-switzerland/,WWOOFing – Learning to Make Cheese in Switzerland,Switzerland," Stepping off the train and finding the bus station, I boarded the vehicle that would take me straight into the Swiss Alps where I was about to learn how to make Alp Kase.  Yes, Cheese.After hopping off the bus with nothing more than my backpack and traveling tent, I entered into a world that I never knew before: Swiss Cheese Making.  I had no idea what to expect.  I didn’t know the family that was working this dairy farm high up in the mountains, I didn’t know how to speak Swiss Deutsch and I certainly didn’t know the first thing about cheese making (except that I absolutely LOVE eating it, which is surely the end step of cheese making).A few months earlier, I decided to “move to Switzerland” for a month to work on an organic farm learning how to make cheese.  You see, not only have I been an avid traveler, but somehow, an avid cheese eater.I had first heard of WWOOFing while backpacking and hiking in the Swiss Alps a few years earlier.  Fellow hostel-mates told amazing stories of coffee bean picking in Ecuador or helping raise windmill farms in Chile.  This was all possible through the organization, “World-Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms,” or WWOOF.The idea is that you align your passions, dreams and ideals to a similar organic farm, and in exchange for daily work the farm provides you with food and lodging as well as insights into organic farming and living.  Some farms accept workers for short spurts of time, where others ask for more of a commitment, especially if in a job that requires some training.You can find WWOOF farms literally all over the world and in almost any field of interest.  However, the main objective is to learn about organic farming and living.  So, if living an organic life isn’t that important to you, you shouldn’t see this as just a cheap way to see another part of the world.  You should truly be invested and interested in that way of life and how you can incorporate it more into your own after your experience on the farm.  While this small farm that I was traveling to solo was not the actual farm I would be working on for the full month, it was where I would spend one of the most memorable weekends of my life!After hiking up to the AlpKaserie (Cheesemaking home), I was already exhausted.  There were no buses or public transportation that went up that far, so my only option was to use my legs to get from the bus stop in the valley to the mountain home and farm.As I made my way into the barn in the early evening, two young men came out to greet me.  We did our best to communicate in broken English and my best attempt at German when finally they just simply said,“You shovel shit?”Well, I guess that translates into every language…And that is how I started my weekend learning to make cheese; by shoveling cow manure.  I’m not quite sure how I pictured learning to make cheese without tending to the cows, but somehow, this little detail had escaped me.Next, it was time to milk the cows.  In my mind, I originally envisioned squatting down on a tiny stool and hand milking each cow one by one.  Oh, how naive this city girl was!  Of course, there was mechanical machinery ready to make the process quick and simple!While it was nowhere near bedtime by most people’s standards, as hard-working farmers we had an early morning upon us. It was time for dinner, a few drinks and then bedtime.Except I had no comfy bed for the weekend, considering this teeny tiny farmhouse barely held the family members that lived there.  So, I set up my one-person tent out in the cow pasture, used my backpack for a pillow and prepared for a night under the Alpine stars.Originally, I had no problem with this sleeping accommodation.  That is, until the pre-dawn, early morning when the cows instinctively knew that food and milking would come soon enough.  I awoke around 4 am surrounded by a herd of cows mooing loudly next to my tent, as others came tramping down the mountainside, neck bells clanging loudly with them.After an hour of failed attempts of going back to sleep while being serenaded by cows, it was time to get moooving.  Our morning consisted of the same milking routine as the evening before and then into the kitchen to prepare for the actual cheese making.  First, it was warming the milk, then adding cheese culture,  Next, rennet was added to start to solidify the cheese curds and finally, we could mold the cheese into large circles.  After pressing the large rounds of cheese and giving them a salt bath, we then made our way into the cellar for washing the already formed cheeses to ensure no cracking as they aged for months.  After sanitizing all of our molds and supplies, my morning cheese making was complete!The afternoon was spent hiking the beautiful Alps, something more difficult than I imagined after a night of little sleep and a map not fit for alpine navigation but worth all the effort for the stunning scenery and peaceful moments in nature.As I returned in the evening for the same round of chores, realizing that this was a cheese farmers routine day in and day out, and wondering if I’d be trapped in a “Ground Hogs Day” type life for the next 30 days, I was thankful that my own daily life had a little more variety to it.After the month of WWOOFing in Switzerland, I did indeed have a different outlook on farming, self-sustainability and organic ways of living.  I also was able to see firsthand how the locals lived and experience things that I never would have been able to, had I never ventured out of my hometown.  Alternatively, if I had decided to just stay at hotels and guest houses throughout Switzerland like many people to while traveling, I would have missed out on an amazing adventure.And that is what travel is really about to me.  It is about new experiences; it’s about meeting people in their natural element and appreciating their way of life, as different as it is from yours.  Travel is about pushing yourself in ways you didn’t know you could be pushed; but mostly, I love that travel connects you to the world- wherever that may be.To read more about the daily, adventures, farm chores and life while WWOOFing in Switzerland, read LeAnna’s full story of Swiss WWOOFing Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/zuri-fascht-the-best-party-you-never-heard-of-zurich-switzerland/,"Züri Fäscht – The Best Party You Never Heard Of – Zurich, Switzerland",Switzerland,"Zurich, Switzerland is a city better known for its bankers and its numbered bank accounts than it is as a party destination for backpackers. While that is generally true, occasionally Zurich let’s its hair down and parties. But, if you don’t read German you have probably never even heard of the 3 day party known as Züri Fäscht.If the phrase “no one parties like the Swiss” does not roll easily off your tongue then you have probably never attended Züri Fäscht which is a party hosted by Zürich once every three years, including this year 2013. In 2007 my family and 3 of our closest friends attended along with 2 million of Zürich’s closest friends.We were barely in Zürich for an hour before my task-oriented wife started behaving even more efficiently than usual. “I am finally at home. These are my people!” she declared. We managed to talk her out of the idea of immediately apartment hunting long enough to explore the city and the festival.The city of Zürich was built astride the Limmat River where it flows into a large inland lake known as the Zürichsee. The festival takes over the area on both sides of the Limmat near the river’s mouth. The festival had 200 food booths and 120 beer tents. The math of how you dispose of 300,000 liters of beer in 300 portable toilets is certainly efficient… and more than a little frightening.Zürich entertained us with a variety of acts from tight-rope performers to stunt planes. A local radio station sponsored a ski jump competition where contestant after contestant would jump off a large ski jump, strike a pose in midair than then crash loudly into the river. This activity seems to have been thought up by someone in the school of thought that “it’s only funny until someone gets hurt… then it’s hilarious”. Picture a large belly flop contest with skis.Züri Fäscht boasted 60 stages for performers of all musical genres. Some of the music, like the Queen tribute show “We Will Rock You” were wildly popular. Some of the bands like Japanese Elvis impersonators dressed in pink seemed ill-considered in a country where presumably everyone has those little knives in their pockets. We were perhaps at times only one more rendition of “Blue Suede Shoes” away from the crowd rushing the stage brandishing their corkscrew attachments. Bands played from 10 am to 5 am but then the crowds continued to sing on until dawn.In Switzerland, the land of melted cheese, we ate fondue of course but we also tried raclettes. A raclette is basically a large wheel of cheese melted with an open flame, scraped into molten piles of cheesy goodness on a plate and served with pearl onions, potatoes, and pickles. We also ordered a sort of “stake” sandwich which comes with a large stake (that could come in handy in the unlikely event of a vampire attack) impaling beef and a roll.We stayed in the inexpensive City Backpacker’s Hostel (http://www.city-backpacker.ch/) which was right in the middle of the party. They tried to talk us out of staying there. They asked us repeatedly “you understand that one of the stages is just outside our door and the music will be playing until 5 am?” What we gave up in quiet we gained in efficiency.When the sun went down the crowds gathered for the fireworks show. Projectors played across the twin towers of the Grossmünster Church built by Charlemagne. At times the church was a large Züri Fäscht billboard and then moments later was red with white crosses like two tremendously large swiss army knives (presumably with equally large corkscrews to protect the city from additional Elvis impersonators).The fireworks show was a tremendous half-hour long pop music accompanied extravaganza held on both Friday and Saturday nights in the sky over the Zürichsee. We watched from the 2nd bridge from the lake where the previously well-behaved crowds finally lost their Swiss reserve and got a bit pushy. Our friends watched from the 1st bridge where it was every man for himself and the crowds got downright scary. 300,000 liters of beer and aerial explosions has that effect on people, even the Swiss.After 19 hours of continuous partying, when the party finished at 5 am Zürich was trashed. There were broken bottles on the streets and every trash can was overflowing. The once orderly city looked anything but Swiss… which may explain why this party only happens once every 3 years. But, by the time the party started again at 10 am the city was cleaner than Paris on a good day. After all, no one parties like the Swiss. The next Züri Fäscht is July 2-4 of 2013. If you go, tell my wife I miss her.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-five-weeks-one-summer-by-martin-e-block/,Book Review: “Five Weeks One Summer” by Martin E. Block,Switzerland,"If you are curious about what it would be like to spend a summer in the Swiss Alps as a solo hiker, then “Five Weeks One Summer” by Martin E. Block might fit the bill.Before discussing this book further, there are a few pieces of housekeeping that are important to understand.  Five Weeks One Summer is not a guidebook for hiking the Swiss Alps, even though that was Martin E. Block’s original intention.   Knowing that it wasn’t a guidebook, I incorrectly assumed that I would be reading a memoir of travel.  Block does share his thoughts with the reader yet it doesn’t have the feel of a memoir, so labeling it a diary, record or collection of notes is more appropriate.  Once I understood the book’s genre, I could more easily put aside my critical eye for writing style and deep introspection and enjoy Block’s journey.Block stays true to his natural voice throughout the book so being privy to UK slang and terminology is helpful.Would it be beneficial to read this book prior to a hiking trip to the Swiss Alps?  Possibly.  The book illustrates the ups and downs of hiking in this region with an emphasis at times of what not to do.  At one point, Block realizes his 30 year old guidebook would have been harmful in his trip planning after someone allows him to peruse a newer version.Even though a great deal of the book focuses on hiking, I found myself more intrigued in the hiking culture of lodging, wrestling with what gear to take and what to leave behind and Block’s numerous challenges and triumphs with laundry, food, and social encounters.In addition to a diary of his hiking journey, Block also includes over thirty-five photographs he took during his five week adventure.  Each photograph has a description yet it would have been more helpful to reference each photograph as it is mentioned in the book (see image 2.5, etc.).  The inclusion of more detailed maps would have also been helpful to fully understand Block’s travels and the distances among his various hikes.  I understand that this is not meant to be a hiking guide yet simple hand drawn maps that provide an overview of each section of his journey would have given me a better sense of place and relationship among his hikes.  There is a “map of where I went” at the beginning of the book yet it is small and the type is challenging to read.If you are a hiker, have hiked the Swiss Alps, are planning to hike the Swiss Alps or are curious about the life of solo hiker, then you might find some value in reading Five Weeks, One Summer.Disclaimer: A free copy of this book was given to the volunteer with an expectation that an honest review would be written for it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/zermatt-switzerland-the-village-in-the-shadow-of-the-matterhorn/,"Zermatt, Switzerland – The Village in the Shadow of the Matterhorn",Switzerland,"Zermatt Originally uploaded by dsearls It’s difficult to describe Zermatt in a way that manages to convey the strange majesty of the place. This tiny Swiss village is packed to the rafters with people on ski holidays, hikers and tourists, and yet, has managed to retain its twisting alleyways and characteristic brown chalets. It sits in the shadow of the enormous, mysterious, Matterhorn mountain; a sight that has to be seen to be understood.Downhill SkiiingNaturally it is the mountains that draw so many people in to Zermatt for group ski holidays, and with 313km of downhill skiing across the 59 peaks served by 40 ski lifts, offering beginner’s slopes near the village, intermediate and advanced runs further up the mountain and even heli-skiing; Zermatt is certainly well-suited to ski holidays. But people come for a ski holiday, and return for the atmosphere.MatterhornCertainly the Matterhorn casts its own strange magic across the village, but even without it, the dichotomy between the crowded, car-free streets and the vast Alpine landscape surrounding it make a visit to Zermatt worthwhile all in itself. This has not gone unnoticed, and during the high season (Christmas/New Year and February), Zermatt contains nearly 20,000 people seeking ski holidays, mountain biking, hiking and the Matterhorn in a village comprised of only 5 or 6 streets; a situation only made tolerable by the absence of cars.Car FreeThe ban on wheels is enforced with a dogged persistence by a dedicated police force, and anyone seen driving into Zermatt is immediately fined 100 Swiss Francs, no matter what excuse you have up your sleeve. Similarly, anyone caught cycling on the Bahnhofstrasse between the church and the train station is slapped with a fine of 50 Swiss Francs. Pedestrianisation is taken seriously in Zermatt which some find an inconvenience, most however find it refreshing.Despite these strictly enforced prohibitions cars and bikes, there are silent, electric taxis that have a tendency to stalk unwitting pedestrians and bell-equipped horse drawn carriages that make you wish the taxis came with bells as well. If you’re lucky enough to score accommodation on the outskirts of the village where you can escape the crowded streets, the absence of traffic noise is a special silence.CostThose looking for a budget ski holiday would do well to avoid Zermatt. Its excellent reputation and unique atmosphere have made it a decidedly upmarket skiing destination, and amongst the 600 or so hotels on offer, most are in the 239 Swiss Francs or above range, per night for two people. But if you can afford it, a family ski holiday to Zermatt, in the shadow of the Matterhorn, amongst the chiming horse-drawn carriages and vigilantly fining policemen is truly something special.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/visiting-chiles-grey-glacier/,Visiting Chile’s Grey Glacier,Chile,"Although many would prefer the warm climates of the Caribbean as opposed to the freezing temperatures of the southern-most areas of South America, there is still a wondrous view of Earth history lying in wait. As one of Chile’s most extravagant of scenery, Grey Glacier has attracted many visitors to experience that part of history. As this magnificent 30-meter high wall of ice recedes, time is not on its side. Before long, the glacier may be nothing more than part of an expanding lake.1. Network of Ice – The Grey Glacier is only a small part of a much larger body that produces nearly 50 separate locations created by walls of ice. Easily found on Google Earth, you can see that the main body of the glacier is immense in size and stretches for miles. This glacier is also one of three of the most prominent locations of fresh water on the planet.2. The Grey Lake – Formation of the Grey Lake is caused from melt-off from the Grey Glacier. It is common place to see large icebergs making their way across the lake slowly melting into the body of the very calm waters. Boating expeditions frequently take visitors to a safe distance to view the glacier which towers over the surface of the water. In some ares, the ice formations of the glacier are reminiscent of a wave of water that had been flash frozen while in motion.As the waters of the lake are so calm, many will find kayaking an enjoyable experience. Although the frigid waters are not the most ideal to capsize in, paddling across the still waters and viewing the many icebergs can be quite exhilarating.3. Marred by Time – As the Grey Glacier slowly recedes, it reveals the scarred and rocky landscape developed from the slow movement of ice. Currently barren of life, these monuments of Earth may have never been seen by human eyes before. Earth’s history is slowly being revealed, but at the cost of a monumental feature that could have severe repercussions later on.As the glacier retreats back to the main body of ice, you can see how plants adapt to the unveiling of new landscape. In the middle of the Grey Glacier’s face is a body of rock that is two-thirds covered with plant-life. However, a short distance from that green carpet of life rests the plain surface of rock that had been exposed from under the ice perhaps centuries ago. Slowly, this plant-life is covering this mountain face as time and winds provide the necessary components for life to spread across the rock’s surface. This is much like how the oceans bring debris to a volcanic mound in order to form a tropical island paradise.4. Hiking the Glacier – Many visitors will hike the wondrous landscape provided by this ancient body of ice. Tours and private hiking expeditions will scour the icy plain and experience a part of Earth’s history. As some areas may be unstable or extremely difficult to hike due to the jagged juts of ice, hikers need to be wary of some of the dangers that could be presented as they cross this body of ancient frozen water.5. Hotels – There are several hotels in the area of the Grey Glacier. The Hotel Lago Grey, for example, sits on the southern end of the lake with a magnificent view of the water and the glacier itself. Regular boating tours are provided by the hotel with its own ship, the “Grey II.” This ship is large enough for 50 passengers to sit comfortably as they experience the lake and the ever-changing beauty of the Grey Glacier.While the glacier is the main attraction for the area, the entire national park is a treasure trove of wildlife and natural beauty. Tours and transportation are available from the Hotel Lago Grey to the refuge located in the area. The area is full of plant-life, and creatures of all kinds call the area of Grey Glacier their home.There are many places on this planet that are ever-changing. Due to climate changes, glaciers like the Lago Grey will be lost to history and never to be experienced again in the same way. If you are interested in experiencing an ancient overlook of the world, your time may be ticking faster than you realize. Some aspects of the planet just can’t be put on hold and expected to remain the same. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/hangzhou-west-lake-and-its-history-china/,Hangzhou West Lake and Its Legends – China,China,"The “most beautiful and magnificent city in the world”, so said Marco Polo. Without a doubt, he might just be right when talking about Hangzhou. It has a lot to offer would-be travelers, and at just a short 50-minute journey by train from glamorous Shanghai, is incredibly easy to access.Yet the reason for Hangzhou’s popularity has to do with more than just its convenience. Hangzhou’s popularity has to do with the stories which lay beneath it; its hidden histories. Interweaved through Hangzhou’s best attractions and places to visit, there are so many threads that it’s almost impossible to keep track.The West Lake: Forged from the Battles of HeavenThe West Lake is located in the center of Hangzhou and is one of the biggest draws for tourists to the city. It is incredibly beautiful.The story goes that West Lake began when the Jade Dragon and Golden Phoenix found a brilliant white jade stone. Every day, they would make sure to polish and clean it thoroughly, worried that its pure white surface would be ruined by even the tiniest of scratches. Eventually, that stone became so polished that it became a stunning white ball, and wherever its light could reach, beautiful flowers would spring from the ground.So, when the Empress of heaven heard of the ball, she wanted it for herself. Sending her army to go and collect it, a war began between the Jade Dragon and Gold Phoenix, and those who came from heaven. It was bitter and lasted for a long time. Until one day the ball was dropped from such a great height that when it hit the ground, it created the West Lake and Phoenix Mountain. To this day, the Phoenix mountain keeps a watchful eye over the West Lake, protecting it from the agents of heaven.Visit West Lake TodayToday, West Lake is a huge tourist attraction and easily accessed by any means of public transport in the city. If you take the metro, make sure to stop at Fengqi Road or Longxiangqiao stations. Both of these are just a 10-minute walk to the lakefront. Just like the things we love about China, the area is still relatively cheap and the people are very welcoming. Just be warned that it can get a little crowded.If you plan to walk around the West Lake, then plan for around 3 hours. It’s not a hard hike, but it can take a long time.Leifeng Pagoda: The Legend of the White SnakeStanding guard over West Lake like a sentinel waiting for a command, Leifeng Pagoda is one of Hangzhou’s most famed destinations. It’s not just the fact that it is a beautiful structure. No, similar architecture can be seen all over China. The reason it is famous is that of the story behind it. A story of star-crossed lovers, betrayal, and immortality. The Story of the White Snake.This story harks back to the days of old when Hangzhou was still a small town and not the imposing collection of high-rises and carefully planned parks it is today. Leifeng Pagoda was where the woman of the story was imprisoned for some time. Why was she imprisoned? Well, in order to understand the why, you’re going to have to know the who. For that, we’re going to have to go somewhere else.Entrance to Leifeng Pagoda is just 40 RMB for adults and is the only thing on this list which costs money. If you’re interested in moving to the next location with style, think about taking one of the many boats over the lake. These will cost you 150 RMB for about an hour and you can take 4 people in one boat.The Broken Bridge: Where the Story BeganLocated almost directly opposite the Leifeng Pagoda, this West Lake attraction may at first seem like your standard stone bridge. However, it’s a lot more than that. The Broken Bridge is where the Lovers Bai Suzhen and Xuxian first met.The legend goes that he had been walking along the bridge as a young man and was offered a magical piece of food from an immortal posing as a simple salesman. Taking the food, he was granted immortality, but then he started to choke on it. At this point, the immortal helped by performing a good old-fashioned Heimlich maneuver and the roll fell from his mouth and into the lake. There, a white snake came to the surface and gulped it down in one.That snake would later go on to become Bai Suzhen after the roll gave her the power to transform into a human and to fall in love. Despite being locked in the tower, Suzhen eventually escaped and returned to her love. They stayed together until they died. Over time, their story has become one of China’s most talked-about Legends and one of the reasons why Hangzhou is now so popular. There is of course much more to the story, but that’s for another time.Unlock Hangzhou’s Mysteries One at a TimeVisit Hangzhou to Unlock more of the city’s mysteries. The two stories above are just a small sample of the hidden histories (both real and fictional), that lie behind almost anywhere you can visit in the city. Try walking around West Lake and seeing what else you can find. Or, try heading to the Xi Xi Wetlands, where the reeds cover statues and hidden pagodas.If it’s not already, make sure that Hangzhou city is on your list of places to visit in China. Now you know that it’s convenient to access, incredibly beautiful (like a white pearl), and has some of the best backstories of anywhere in China.Share this: "

Many itineraries to Tibet are around 4 to 5 days and usually begin with a flight into Lhasa followed by a day of rest.Jokhang TempleAfter that, they almost always include a visit to the Potala Palace, the Jokhang Monastery, Barkhor Street, the Drepung Monastery to see the Monk’s debate, the Dalai Lama’s Summer Palace, and possibly a visit to the nearby holy lake. Longer visits may include a journey to the Everest Base Camp. Jokhang Temple RoofTop Things to Do in TibetWhen my wife and I began planning our trip to Tibet, we decided that we wanted to see all the traditional tourist destinations such as the Potala Palace, but we also wanted to add a day or two to explore some of the scenic beauty of the region.When we consulted Trip Advisor, we found that a significant number of the “Top Things to Do” were visiting monasteries and temples. Monasteries in China are very interesting to visit, and we have been to many in other areas of China. Personally, I have found that they are very similar, and also I have discovered that even though they may look ancient, they are not always very old or historic. We knew that two or three monasteries would be enough for us.We would have loved to journey to Everest Base Camp, but we did not have enough time to visit both Lhasa and Everest Base Camp. Also, we knew that the farther our travel date was from winter and spring, the less likely we would be able to see a clear view of Everest.A Drive Through the Lhasa River ValleyWhen we decided to make this journey, we initially planned to go there by the traditional method of flying directly to Lhasa. After some research and consultation with a Chinese tourist guide, we ended up putting together an itinerary that began by spending two days in lower Tibet, followed by a drive through the Lhasa River Valley, and finishing with four sightseeing days in and around Lhasa.Our rationale was that we would take a few days to acclimate while also seeing as much of the scenic beauty of Tibet as possible. In lower Tibet, we visited the Luling Primitive Forest and Basum Tso Lake. Both were authentically beautiful. Unfortunately, the drive to Lhasa was exhausting due to the overcrowded roads and the travel restrictions of the Chinese government. These caused very slow travel and excruciating bottlenecks at checkpoints. Much to our dismay, we were physically and mentally exhausted by the time we arrived at Lhasa.LhasaIt is worth noting some misconceptions about Lhasa. The city is in the Himalayas, but it is surrounded by mostly low mountains and valleys. Lhasa itself sits on a high elevation plateau, so the landscape does not provide many high mountain vistas. In fact, during the summer, it is unlikely that you will see snow-covered peaks near Lhasa.The area is classified as semi-arid, and it is not unusual to see large sand dunes as you approach the city. Much of the challenge in visiting Lhasa is dealing with the altitude. The altitude affects everyone in some way. You may not get physically sick, but it will affect your ability to do things. Most people take a full day to relax when they arrive in Lhasa to adjust to the altitude.Peace ParkIn Lhasa, we lodged at the Shangri-La hotel, refreshed ourselves, and planned to see the traditional sites. These were well worth seeing.Potala PalaceAny visit to Lhasa must include a visit to the Potala Palace. You will need tickets during the summer tourist season. Take note that the tickets are expensive and are for a timed entry. Prime viewing times in the morning, must be booked well in advance. Lines to get in are long and there are 380 steps to walk up to reach the historic rooms at the top. This was not an easy task in the oxygen-thin air of the Himalayas.Our guide was great in explaining to us every historic aspect of the building and the monasteries at the top. We spent a full morning investigating every room open to the public. Even more impressive were the outdoor vistas from the upper floors of the palace. We could see the nearby Peace Park, all of Lhasa, and many neighboring mountains.Barkhor StreetJokhang MonasteryOur afternoon visit was to the Jokhang Monastery. The real value of visiting this site is going to the roof to see the exceptional views of downtown Lhasa and the Potala Palace. Outside the Jokhang Monastery, we visited Barkhor Street, a traditional touristy shopping street. There were many stores here, but most of them sold similar types of merchandise. It was a fun way to spend an hour, but in general, it was difficult to bargain and was very touristy.Ballad of Princess WenchengWe were back at our hotel by early afternoon and decided to see a live, outdoor show called the Ballad of Princess Wencheng in the evening. The show was a spectacle that contained a cast of 600 actors, 30 sheep, and 80 yaks. This is the kind of thing you can only see in China. Even though the show was overpriced, we enjoyed it.Unfortunately, to get there we had to climb up over 300 steps to enter the theater. Later that evening, back at the hotel, the physical exertion of this experience triggered severe symptoms of altitude sickness with my wife. She ended up having to rest in bed for the remainder of our days in Tibet and even had to make a trip to the hospital for an oxygen treatment. I was fine, and once my wife was resting peacefully, I decided to push on with a few of the remaining items we had booked for our trip.Norbulingka ParkNorbulingka ParkOne experience I enjoyed was a trip to Norbulingka Park to see the traditional summer residences of the Dalai Llamas since 1780. Of course, the current Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, so these residences are historical buildings.Norbulingka ParkIt was fascinating to see the progression of separate homes where past Dalai Llamas worked away from the Potala Palace. I actually enjoyed this experience as much as any site we saw in Lhasa due mostly to the peacefulness and beauty of the park. It was also fascinating to see the human side of the Dalai Lama’s life.Monk’s DebateDrepung MonasteryAfter returning to our hotel (which was only two blocks from Norbulingka Park) to check on my wife, I then took an afternoon excursion to the Drepung Monastery to visit the Assembly Hall and experience the monk’s debating in a courtyard. The debate seemed more of a staged tourist event than anything else, but it was interesting and enhanced my experience of visiting the monastery.Upon my return, I found that my wife was getting better, but she was not ready to venture from the hotel. Due to her need to recuperate, we did not get to spend time exploring the city of Lhasa at night. Lhasa does have a vibrant downtown that includes many restaurants and places to shop.Lake NamtsoLake NamtsoOn my last full day in Lhasa, I traveled with my guide to the holy lake of Namtso. I chose this lake because it was farther from Lhasa than other holy lakes and was at a much higher elevation (15,479 ft / 4,718 m).The day began with a rainy mist in the Lhasa Valley, and of course, the main travel road had multiple checkpoints. The drive was slow, but it was incredibly scenic. Here I saw winding river valleys, inspiring mountain vistas, along with the intrusion of new high-speed train lines.Lake NamtsoAs we rose in elevation, I began to see snow-covered peaks with small glaciers filling the areas in-between. The scenery was breath-taking. To get to the lake, we had to traverse one of the snow-covered passes (at an elevation of 16,761 ft) and drive down the other side to the lake. This was truly the Tibet of my imagination, and I look back at this being my finest memory of Tibet. I was the only Westerner I saw on this day.Lake NamtsoLake Namtso is a pilgrimage site and there were many people visiting on this sunny, but cold summer day. The salt-water lake was ringed by high mountains, but there was a large flat area in-between the mountains and the lake. The terrain was tundra-like and there were no trees.Security was very tight here. To enter the lake area, we again had to pass multiple checkpoints. At the last one, I actually had to get out, show my passport, and be inspected.Inside the lake complex there was an area that contained campsites for visitors and tents for groups to eat. There were also touristy markets and food vendors. The lake is the focal point of this region, and everyone headed there first.Lake NamtsoA popular attraction for many people was to have their photograph taken on a yak that was standing in the water. In addition, there were some rock outcroppings that had been turned into shrines along with some Buddhist temples. We spent about an hour and a half at the lake before heading back. It was a remarkably enjoyable and scenic excursion.Lake NamtsoOn the way back, we stopped at the Yangpachen thermal hot springs resort, but I elected not to swim. Even though the water was extremely warm, the air was very cold. Nonetheless, it was very exhilarating standing next to the warm hot springs and looking up at the mountains covered with glaciers.My guide and driver had planned to stop for lunch at a Tibetan restaurant on the way back, but it took a long time for them to find a suitable place. Eventually, they complained that even though there were many restaurants along the road, they all served Chinese food, not Tibetan. Even here, in far Tibet, I could easily sense the frustration of the Tibetans as they experienced the takeover of the Han Chinese.By this point, my wife had almost recovered, but we had to leave for our flight back to Shanghai. The drive from Lhasa to the airport was almost an hour on a fairly modern highway. There were more security checkpoints on the way, as well as at the airport entrance. Eventually, we made it to our gate only to find that our flight was delayed for almost three hours. Even worse, our luggage never accompanied us to Shanghai, and we did not see it until two days later.Lake NamtsoConclusionTibet was different and tougher than I expected. The stark Himalayan landscape and dry climate were unlike any mountains I had experienced before. The beauty of the region is its ruggedness, but every day the landscape is being tamed by the Chinese government through mass building programs, high rise apartments, energy projects, modern trains, and multi-lane highways. The movement of tourists is very restricted, and military personnel are visible everywhere. The control of the Chinese government was more evident here than anywhere else I have been in China.Do not expect to experience Shangri-La in Lhasa. In fact, I found it difficult to find any spiritualness among the intensity of the tourism that has flooded the region. At the same time, there were glimpses of the exoticness and remoteness of the past. The majesty of the Potala Palace and the pristine peacefulness of Lake Namtso have become two of my greatest travel memories. I believe it is still worth the effort to experience Tibet, but realize that it has already moved far from its isolated past and is well into the modern world.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/a-different-road-to-lhasa-tibet-china/,A Different Road to Lhasa,China,"After eight journeys to China, last year my wife and I made the decision to visit the Chinese autonomous region of Tibet. This is a trip I have wanted to take for many years, but my wife was reluctant, mostly due to her worries about dealing with the potential effects of altitude sickness. At elevations of 12,000 feet (3,650 m) and above, Tibet can be a challenge for those who spend most of their life at sea level. My past experiences with trips to areas of high elevation have convinced me that no person can ever quite predict the effects of altitude sickness. After much discussion, consultation, and research, we finally decided to tackle the challenge of Tibet.For our journey, we decided to seek a different route to Tibet. Traditionally tourists enter Tibet through Lhasa by flying directly there or taking the train from Chengdu. Both of these routes generally involve transitioning into the high altitude in one day. Our decision was to fly from Chengdu to Linzhi Airport (also known as Nyingchi Mainling Airport) in the lower eastern section of Tibet. We speculated that it would be best to begin at a lower altitude of around 9000 feet (2740 m) and then spend the next two days making our way to the higher elevations of Lhasa. Another goal of our trip was to seek opportunities to experience the natural beauty of the region, rather than focusing on the monasteries of Tibet. Many tourists who visit Tibet often find that much of their journey is made up of visits to monasteries, temples, and other spiritual sites in and around Lhasa. We enjoy these sites, but my past experience in China has proved similar to what I experienced in Europe. In the past, I have found that by the time I got to my 3rd or 4th cathedral, they all began to look similar. I believe the guidebooks call this cathedral fatigue. I seem to experience the same phenomena with monasteries in China. Our expedition was tricky to plan because very few Western tourists travel to Tibet through the eastern region. Entrance to Tibet is heavily restricted for all non-Chinese tourists. A permit is needed from the Chinese government, and all tourists must be on a planned itinerary with a guide licensed by the Chinese Tourist Board. Typically this permit is only issued a few days before entrance into Tibet and is always picked up in China. We opted to pick up our permit in Chengdu where our journey to Tibet would begin. There were other planning considerations for our journey. Almost all the drivers and guides are based in Lhasa. It can be difficult and expensive to get a driver and guide to travel from Lhasa to lower Tibet. We were fortunate that our agent was able to locate two excellent, experienced professionals.After securing our permit, and spending a delightful day in Chengdu, we took the only early morning flight to Linzhi Airport. It was rainy when we arrived, but future weather predictions called for sunny and dry weather. We noticed some effects of the altitude immediately when leaving the plane, but it was not that bad. We actually enjoyed our first day exploring Bayi Town.Our journey the next day to the Lulang Primitive Forest was exciting. Our Land Rover precariously climbed the side of a mountain road and eventually reached an altitude of around 15,000 feet (4000 m). I became a little sluggish at this altitude, but my wife was doing fine. Both of us were amazed at the abundance of Tibetan prayer flags that dotted the landscape. Every stream and mountain pass seemed to sway with flowing red, yellow, blue, green, and white pieces of cloth. We saw only a small portion of Lulang Forest. The main entrance road was pitted with potholes and craters, so it was difficult to travel far into the park. I am sure that the valleys and peaks of the forest were excellent for hiking and camping We simply did not have the time or energy to explore much on foot. During our journey, we saw an abundance of pilgrims and adventure seekers biking the mountain roads up to the 15,000 foot passes. It was inspiring watching them, and I was impressed at the stamina it must have taken to complete this journey. My favorite memories of Lulang Forest were enjoying a local chicken hot pot dinner at a village near the park entrance and shooting arrows at targets with the local Tibetans. All in all, it was a great start to our adventure.Our second day proved to be just as interesting. Our early morning goal was Basum Tso Lake, known for its high altitude and a beautiful temple that sits on an island in the lake. The drive there was breath-taking but slow. The Chinese in Tibet have imposed tough travel restrictions on speed and access to various roads. As an example, there were many checkpoints along our route. Our driver had to get a pass stamped at the first checkpoint and then proceed to the next checkpoint. Drivers are allotted a certain amount of time to reach each checkpoint, but they cannot enter before their allotted time or they are ticketed for speeding. The logic was that if you reached the next checkpoint too quickly, you must have been speeding. Unfortunately, the mandated times dictated incredibly slow speeds. Often we arrived at the next checkpoint well ahead of our allotted time, so we had to sit by the side of the road and wait before we could pass through the next checkpoint.We eventually made it to Basum Tso Lake. It was just as beautiful as it was described to us. Like many national parks in China, we had to park our car at the entrance and take buses around to the sites in the park. The lake was pristine and surrounded by snow-covered mountains. The main attraction at the lake was Tashi Island, which was home to a small Nyingma temple. Even though this area was touristy, it was still very scenic. We explored many pathways on the island that provide beautiful vistas of the nearby snow-covered mountains. Every winding trail was turned into a maze by an abundance of Tibetan prayer flags. On the way back from the island, we saw some speed boats and decided to take a tour of the lake. This was well worth the time and money. Our boat glided throughout the lake and eventually visited the shrine of a monk that was located in a cave near the shoreline. In all, we spent about an hour riding around the lake.After this, it was time for lunch and our drive to Lhasa. We were fascinated by the local scenic beauty and surprised by modern apartment complexes rising in almost every major town we passed through. Lunch was at a small Chinese restaurant in a small city along the way. I ate a simple meal because I knew that if I got ill there would be no modern conveniences along the drive route. I was also aware that sanitation standards in rural China are very different than in the United States. After lunch, we began our journey to Lhasa. It turned out to be a long journey. We were told that the distance of 250 – 300 km would take about 6 hours. In fact, it took about 15 hours. The scenery was breathtaking, but the journey was mentally and physically tough.Was this a great way to get to Lhasa? Well, yes and no. The journey to get there was exhausting. There is no underestimating the Chinese bureaucracy. The travel restrictions on the road and the absolute manufactured chaos at the checkpoints were beyond the mental tolerance of an average normal, sane person. Drivers were badly behaved and the mountain roads were never built for the truck traffic that perilously careens up and down them each day. When we got to Lhasa late at night, the illuminated Potala Palace looked like a mirage rising up from the mountains. It didn’t seem real. It was magical and we remarked that it seemed like we were arriving at a fairy tale kingdom. This little nugget of awe was the jewel we were looking for all day.Did our clever altitude adjustment plan work? Not really. On our second day in Lhasa (our fourth day in Tibet), my wife became ill with altitude sickness and eventually had to receive an oxygen treatment at a city hospital. She spent the rest of her journey in bed recovering. I, on the other hand, experienced virtually no effects of the altitude and eventually traveled to a snow-covered mountain pass that peaked at 16,700 feet (5109 m).Our trip to Tibet was something we will always cherish, for many reasons. For one, it was a challenge, and we were thrilled that we got to see a part of Tibet that few Westerners experience. We also learned that Eastern Tibet will change drastically over the next few years. The Chinese are in the process of totally transforming the Lhasa River Valley. Already the rivers are dammed with hydro-electric projects and massive metal towers with power lines run along the steep sides of the river valley walls. In many places, there were up to four rows of towers and power lines on each side of the valley. Furthermore, the Chinese government will soon complete a modern four-lane highway in 2016 that will wind through the middle of the Lhasa River Valley like a concrete ribbon. This will forever change the look and flow of traffic through Tibet. Progress is marching forward like a high-speed train through every area of China. Tibet will never be the same, and this area will experience a flood of domestic tourists. Tibet is truly a treasure worth exploring, and I am really happy that I had the opportunity to experience a small part of its natural beauty of this mountain paradise before the modern world transforms it with concrete and steel.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/two-sundays-great-wall/,Two Sundays on the Great Wall of China,China,"Every time I travel to China, I try to visit a different section of the Great Wall.  This past summer I had the opportunity to visit two different sections of the Wall on two successive Sundays.  I was very fortunate to have experienced the rare treat of having two back-to-back Sundays in Beijing that featured both comfortable temperatures and clear, sunny skies.  These were perfect days to visit the Wall.The first section I visited was Jinshanling.  This is one of the furthest sections that can be visited on a day trip from Beijing.  Using a personal driver, my family and I started our journey around 8 AM and traveled northeast on a newly built, uncrowded highway.  The journey took about two hours, and we did not experience any of Beijing’s famous congested roadways.At the entrance to the Jinshanling section of the Great Wall, there were about 50 cars, a few small buses, and a few vendors selling supplies and souvenirs. It was not easy to find the ticket office.  In fact, we walked past it on our way to the entrance and then had to backtrack to get our tickets.  The admission cost 65 CNY ($11) each (65 CNY during peak season, 55 CNY during off-season).  To access the Wall at Jinshanling, you must either walk about 4 km up a looping access road, climb a short but steep pathway directly up the Wall, or ride a cable car.  We opted to spend about 40 CNY ($7) for the cable car.  The cable car did not actually take us directly to the Wall.  We still had to navigate a short trail and then climb a set of steep stairs into one of the towers of the Wall.One of the great appeals of Jinshanling is that this area of the Wall is only partially restored.  There are no handrails or easy access areas.  This area is often known as the “Wild Wall,” because many parts are in their natural state of disrepair.  The walking was very rough and very steep in areas.  A good number of stairways had missing steps and missing bricks.  It was difficult to walk on a dry, sunny day.  I suspect that on a wet day, it would be treacherous.As the day went on, we found that in many areas we were walking the Wall by ourselves.  Overall we saw only about 100 people spread over various areas of the Wall.  A few people were making the trek to Simatai, but most of the people were hiking around the Jinshanling area.  The only negative part of the experience was the local farmers trying to sell advice and hawk souvenirs.  Travel guides warn about them and describe them as a minor inconvenience.  They were definitely a distraction, but eventually, they left us alone.  In all, we spent around four hours at this section of the Wall just walking, taking photographs, and enjoying the views.  It was peaceful and thrilling at the same time.  As the afternoon became warmer, we made our way back down.  It was a great experience, and I ranked it as my best visit to the Wall.On the next Sunday, we took some visiting friends to Badaling for their first trip to the Great Wall. What a difference a week makes!We knew that Badaling would be crowded so we asked our driver to pick us up at 6 AM.  We ran into a little traffic in Beijing and then experienced heavy traffic on the Badaling Expressway.  Most of the congestion was caused by large trucks navigating their way through the twists and turns of the expressway as it ascends the hills and passes north of Beijing.  After a stressful ride, we eventually made it to Badaling around 7:30 AM.  By this time, the area was already crowded. Badaling is unique in that visitors are able to access the Wall at a low point and then ascend up the towers and ramps by either going east or west.  Most people head east and try to make it up to the 8th Tower.  This is the highest in elevation in the area.  We purchased our tickets and opted to take the cable car up to Tower 7.  The cost for admission to the Wall was 45 CNY ($8) each (45 CNY during peak season, 40 CNY during off-season).  The round trip ticket for the cable car was another 60 CYN ($10).  By the time we arrived at the cable car at 8 AM, the wait to get to the top was already 45 minutes.The cable car ride was very scenic.  We approached the Great Wall from the north face and departed the cable car at a station inside the mountain.  To get to the Wall we had to walk through a long tunnel.  From this point, it was only a short, but steep walk up to the high point at Tower 8.  Unfortunately, there were thousands of people on the Wall also trying to make it to Tower 8.  In fact, the remainder of our morning was spent trying to push our way through crowds.  There was a lot of shoving and dodging umbrellas that were used for sun protection.  Congestion became very intense at the various towers up and down the Wall as visitors navigated steep steps and wedged through narrow door openings. After we reached Tower 8, we descended the Wall to visit a few of the lower towers.   One attraction we saw on the way down was a toboggan ride.  We thought about getting on it and riding down the Great Wall but were unsure if we would be able to get back to our original bus stop.  After about two hours, we decided to descend the Wall by the same cable car we road up.  By this time, the wait to get down was about one hour.  Eventually, we made our way to the parking lot and our waiting driver.  We were exhausted by the crowds and chaos of the day, and we reflected that it would be at least 5 more years before we would feel the need to revisit Badaling.On the ride home, as my family and friends fell asleep, I began to ponder, “Where should I take future visitors for their first visit to the Great Wall?”  Most likely I will have to make this decision again, and it is important because, for many of my friends, this may be their one-time dream trip.  As we descended the hills south of Badaling, I began to weigh my choices.  There is no doubt that the views at Badaling are spectacular and dramatic.  The Wall threads across the mountains east and west, descending into valleys and reappearing on various hilltops. The incredible scenic beauty along with its proximity to Beijing and accessibility are the main reasons most people go there.  In fact, if you need easy accessibility, then this may be your only choice.  On the other hand, the crowds can be outrageous creating a circus-like atmosphere.  No matter, how much you read about it, you cannot actually understand how crowded and crazy it is until you have experienced it.A location like Jinshanling also has great views, but they are not quite as dramatic as Badaling.  Yet, at Jinshanling, you see both a restored and authentic Wall.  You also experience the freedom and peacefulness of being on the Wall without thousands of visitors and vendors.   In addition, you can actually walk on the Wall for a very long distance and climb through the towers.  On the other hand, it is definitely less accessible.  In fact, if you are not up to strenuous walking or scrambling up steep steps, you would find it impossible.Choosing the best place to see the Great Wall is genuinely a tough choice.  I have visited 6 different sections of the Great Wall and I can genuinely say that I have thoroughly enjoyed all of them.  Each section provided a unique experience and different challenges.   After much reflection, I think my choice to take our guests to Badaling for their first experience was the right choice.  I would do it again.  This was their only Wall experience and they were awed by their visit.  There is also something about the masses of people moving along the Wall that make it feel like a pilgrimage.  The views are genuinely spectacular and the restored Wall is impressive to see.  They were tired after their visit, but they had no complaints.In the final assessment, choosing the best place to see the Great Wall is a matter of personal preference.  Everyone has an opinion about why their choice is the best.  The truth is that regardless of which section you choose, you can and will enjoy your experience.  Just remember to research your trip, be prepared, and adjust your expectations.  These three actions will help to make your choice the right choice and your visit to the Great Wall forever memorable.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/top-tourist-destination-in-china-mount-huangshan/,Top Tourist Destination In China: Mount Huangshan,China,"We came out of the bus, looked up and saw this magnificent mountain range that seemed to reach the sky. “Why oh why did I not check the Wikipedia before agreeing to climb Yellow mountains?” thought I, realizing that my next food intake was scheduled on the summit of one of these mountains, “I will have to work hard for my lunch today!”It was one of those days when the sky was clear. Crowds of tourists from all over China were getting ready to concur these famous mountains. Young and old, nicely dressed, with cameras ready to snap a picture, people were excited to have arrived here the day when picture taking was possible. Apparently, it rains here four out of every five days. Heavy rain clouds hide both mountain peaks and famous, individually named, crooked pine trees. One-sided, beaten by the wind, these pine trees looked like their Canadian relatives from Ontario’s Georgian Bay.Mount HuangshanBrief and informal history of Mt. HuangshanAn inspiration for generations of painters and poets, the national pride of China, the Huangshan range of mountains is proudly called “The Number One Mountain Under Heaven” in China. In the Western world, it is known as the Yellow Mountains. Before I saw them, I wondered if the mountains were, in fact, yellow?They were not. Before 747 AD this mountain range had another name. Yellow was the only color that the emperor could wear in China. Legend has it that the name was changed in honor of the legendary Yellow Emperor, Huang Di. He cultivated his moral character in this location, and then ascended to Heaven from it. This is when this inaccessible mountain range started to get attention; the first stair steps and temples then appeared on it.Now it has more than 60,000 steps, most built after 1970 and masterfully designed (in stone and concrete) to blend with the mountains’ natural looks.stairs, Mt. HuangshanComposed of peaks of unpredictable shapes, beautiful waterfalls, and oddly-shaped pine trees, some of which are a century old, it’s the number one attraction for tourists from all over China. And not only for tourists. Communist Party leaders often bring their important guests, such as top UN, UNESCO, and political officials from different countries, to spend time at the presidential suite at the top of the mountain. Of course, they don’t have to climb the mountain to get there; and, in fact, you don’t have to either. You can take a cable car and enjoy the view from the air or use the services of “workers” (or mountain rickshaws?) to get carried to the top in a comfortable bamboo seat.Most people, though, prefer to climb Mt. Huangshan, and we came to climb it, too.Famous PeaksAccording to our guide, the Huangshan mountain range is “very, very old” (as per Wikipedia, 100 mil years old) and has “too many peaks to count.” Many peaks have their own, quite poetic, names. For example, one of them was called “Beginning-To-Believe” by the “famous tourist of the Min dynasty”. It is located on the top, and legend has it that the “famous tourist” said that if you still don’t believe this is the best mountain under Heaven, after seeing this peak you will begin to believe.Though I did not need to be persuaded, I took a picture of this peak to share with the rest of the world:Beginning To Believe PeakJust read the names of these other famous peaks, and appreciate the imagination of the ancient Chinese who named them: Celestial Capital Peak, Ploughing Cloud Peak, Peach Blossom Peak, White Goose Peak, Goddess Peak, The Flying Rock.Climbing Mount HuangshanThe beginning of our ascent was easy. The only thing that made us wary of the challenge in front of us was the number of people coming down the stairs in every funny way imaginable, for example backward and sideways. Our guide explained that some people have pain in their knees after hiking ‘many, many stairs’ and pulled out knee supports from his backpack.It turned out to be an eight-hour hike.We seemed to be a major tourist attraction ourselves, and quickly lost count of how many people asked to take a picture with us. Though a top tourist destination among the Chinese, this mountain is yet to become known to Westerners, who mostly stick to the cities.Sweaty and tired, dressed for hiking, we were surrounded by beautiful Chinese girls in elaborate hats, lace dresses, and matching shoes (some on the high heels!). By our calculation, we climbed more than 20,000 stairs and they must have done about as many. Our appearance was only to be compared to that of the “workers”.A word about “workers”Everything, absolutely everything that you use at the hotels at the top is carried there by workers. Bedsheets and food, water and wires get to the top of the mountain by manual labor. We calculated that some workers were carrying up to 60 kg (132 lbs) on their backs. That’s why coffee at the top costs 55 yuan, which is 9 dollars.Yellow Mountain WorkersWe saw the most beautiful mountain peaks and joined the throng of hundreds of local tourists to see the famous sunrise at 5:12 am. Many locals slept in their tents right by the hotel, but foreign tourists were not allowed to do so, and we settled for a four-star accommodation.Coming down, and looking back, it was hard to believe that just today we were at the top of the mountain by the tower in this picture:Yellow Mountain, ChinaHiking Mt. Huangshan was the most spectacular weight loss exercise I have ever undertaken.Do you now see why James Cameron spent a lot of time in Huangshan and is said to have drawn his inspiration for the nature in Avatar from the Yellow mountains?Huangshan was the highlight of our trip. We loved its crystal cold streams and waterfalls. “Careful! The water is OK for the Chinese! It can be too cold for you!” screamed our guide as we drank tasty water. It did not need the water cleaning pills that we brought with us. We were fascinated by the peaks and valleys, enchanted by the stories of the trees, and excited to observe beautiful birds and their little ones learning to fly. What a beautiful place to spread your wings.Mountain bird learning to flyWe shall return. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/zhangjiajie-national-park-chinas-avatar-mountains/,Zhangjiajie National Park – China’s “Avatar Mountains”,China,"If you have seen Avatar – famous American blockbuster directed by James Cameron – you probably held your breath seeing Pandora’s floating mountains and wished you could be there. You can, they are real, in China at Zhangjiajie. Even among Chinese, you will find some who have never heard of Zhangjiajie, so it is not surprising that most foreign travelers who visit China miss this attraction.Observing the Avatar MountainsOk, the mountains do not float above the ground, but they do rocket to the sky, and on a foggy day you can’t tell if they touch the earth. I have visited Zhangjiajie by a chance, together with my fellow teachers in Chinese high school. I was shocked as much by the sights as for the lack of tourists. Despite its natural beauty, and being listed as UNESCO World Heritage site, Zhangjiajie, foreign travelers are rare.The Hallelujah Floating Mountains in ZhangjiajieZhangjiajie National Forest Park is a place where you can visit fantastic Pandora, without the need for space travel, and stay in the park for a few days. Trekking through spectacular scenery does not have to end in the evening. You can stay overnight, either out in the forest or in a cheap hostel, within its boundaries. The entrance ticket (at the time of my visit it was RMB248 which is about $40 ) enables you to step into the park through the main gate for three days, but tickets are not checked on the exit. It means that once in you can freely explore every corner for as long as you like as long as you don’t try to reenter after 3 days.Welcome to PandoraFree eco shuttle buses are available throughout the park. Although I don’t understand how one could call them eco (they are old and certainly not eco-friendly in terms of emissions), but it’s worth taking a ride. Firstly, it’s much quicker to cover vast terrain. Secondly, it’s a mad ride, best compared to the roller-coaster.The stunning Floating Mountains are only in Hunan Province in ChinaApart from multiple sandstone rocks and a variety of trees, plants, and animals, you’ll get to experience something more unique – being some kind of a rock star (you don’t have to play guitar, don’t worry). Imagine going to a tourist attraction and suddenly becoming a tourist attraction. Chinese people would love to take a photo with the beautiful scenery as much as with you. Actually, you’ll be running away from Chinese teenage girls by the end of the day.The stunning scenery of ZhangjiajieThere are not many places on this planet such as this one. I have not been to a place that took my breath away for longer than ZhangJiaJie yet and the bar has been set high. Despite my utmost efforts to tell everyone around, it’s still a place somewhat off-the-path. What stops you from going there?Find out what happened to me when I visited Zhangjiajie and how I travel the world for less than $25 per day at eTramping.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/intrepid-travel-china/,"Intrepid Travel China – Review of China Highlights Tour (Beijing, Xian, Suzhou, Shanghai)",China,"Amateur Traveler has done3 tours with Intrepid Travel taking our listeners and readers to interesting places (Morocco, Cambodia, India, Africa). Here is the story of the first trip I took with them and why I like working with them.Bus TourIt started with an email advertising a guided tour of China from another company. It looked like traveling to China would be much cheaper than heading the other direction to Europe again, especially from out here near San Francisco, California. The one catch was that the trip in the email would be your typical 40 person bus tour.Our preferred way to travel is independently but we did not know if we were quite ready to visit China on our own. Even with having studied Chinese for a year in night school I never knew more than 200 Chinese characters and would be surprised if I remembered half of those today.We had enough experience with bus tours from the first Amateur Traveler listener trip to Egypt to know what that means – big groups, only eating at restaurants that can hold 40 people, looking at the world through bus windows and lots of stops at shopping opportunities (learn more at Traveling to Beijing, China with a Tour – Amateur Traveler Episode 187). So I started looking at alternatives and in the process came back to the IntrepidTravel.com site. I had been on their mailing list for some time. There were a number of things that I liked about what they were offering:They offered different levels of comfort. Personally I don’t need to stay in a luxury hotel every night. I sleep with my eyes closed. I need a quiet clean room. The China Highlights trip we ended up booking was their middle level of comfort.Their trips were not fully structured but offered a lot of free time which sounded like a better fit for people like us who are used to traveling on our own or for people not quite ready to travel on their own.Their groups usually have a maximum number of 16 travelers.Because they have fewer people they can use more local transportation to get around. Our tour group: 3 Yanks, 2 Canadians, 3 Aussies, 2 Brits and a cross-section of ages. China HighlightsThe China Highlights trip is a 9 day trip to Beijing, Xi’an, Suzhou, and Shanghai. I had been to Shanghai but not the other 3 destinations. My wife and son had not been in mainland China.When we took the trip it was called China Express and ran in the opposite direction than it does now. We started in Beijing and ended in Shanghai.We opted not to get the airport connection in Beijing but made our way on our own to the hotel. We arrived the day before the tour started to recover somewhat from jet lag. We booked the extra night in the same hotel through Intrepid to make things simple.BeijingWe explored Beijing on our own that first day and had a wonderful time. We visited the Temple of Heaven complex which was within walking distance from our centrally located hotel. We even met some very nice local art students from Xi’an who took us to a show they were having where we bought some of their “original” artwork.That night we met Robert who was our tour leader. Robert was easily the best thing about the Intrepid Tour. Not only was he knowledgeable and incredibly nice but throughout the tour, he went out of his way to provide more than what was offered in the brochure. Within the first half-hour, Robert told us things like common scams in the area… like the one where people say they are local art students and sell knock-off artwork as “original” works which we had already fallen for.Great WallOne of the highlights of Beijing was the Great Wall. We drove a little further out to see the area of the Great Wall at Mutianyu which was awe-inspiring. In this area, the wall is reconstructed. It is also very very hilly. Rather than being the Great Wall, it is more like the Great Staircase. We had a few options to get to the top of the wall. We could hike up or we could take the gondola which I think was a separate charge. We opted for the hike which was short but strenuous. In addition to hiking down or taking the gondola, you could also take a toboggan ride down from the wall. Robert presented the different options and let people choose what worked for them. I opted for the toboggan with a few others from our group. Joan and Mike hiked back down. I think I made the right choice but see what you think. It was a faster way down and was much better on your knees. Joan was afraid that the toboggan would be unsafe but there were people posted every few feet encouraging you to watch your speed. ﻿﻿﻿﻿Tiananmen SquareWe visited Tiananmen Square which is still a center for gatherings in China. It is not a place for political discussions Robert advised us as the government is still very sensitive to what happened here in 1989. When we were there they were still set up for Golden Week which was just ending so there were large displays there for the holiday. There we also large, really large, display screens showing scenes of beautiful Chinese landscapes.The Forbidden CityThe forbidden city was made to impress people with the might of the emperor and it still has that effect on visitors.  There are two parts of the Forbidden City. The first part is the public spaces where everything is large and imposing. But the second part is where the imperial family actually lived. It is surprisingly modest. The emperor’s bedroom was no larger than ours. We had time on our own to explore the city as well, which some guidance from Robert. We visited one of the major temples, the Lama Temple and got out to an area by a lake where the restaurants were filled with American pop music but the crowd was all locals.  Xi’anAlthough Robert was always our tour leader, Intrepid would sometimes provide a different tour guide for a different destination such as the terra cotta warriors at Xi’an. We took the night train from Beijing to Xi’an but because it was close to the huge Golden Week celebration we were only able to get accommodations in the 2nd class night train.Usually, this tour takes the nicer train car. Because of this I would try and avoid traveling around Golden Week or Chinese New Year.We were picked up a local bus driver and tour guide before visiting the famous terra cotta warriors that date back to the 1st Dynasty in China. Surprisingly most of these warriors were broken into pieces by angry peasants, just a few years after their construction as the First “Dynasty” ended a few years into the reign of its second king. The warriors are, in effect, the world’s largest jigsaw puzzle.Robert gave a quick tour of the Muslim quarter of this ancient city at the eastern end of the silk road, then we had time on our own to explore and sample some of the local cuisine. We also had time for those of us who were interested to walk the ancient city walls.This kind of flexibility is an essential part of the Intrepid approach. The whole group would see the major sites and then there would be discretionary time where the more bold would explore on their own while Robert might guide the more timid to their desired destination. We were technically on our own for most meals but often ate as a group since many restaurants could accommodate a group of 11.Before we left Xi’an we stopped at a center for people with developmental disabilities that is supported by the charitable arm of Intrepid. Score so far, charities one, mandatory gift shop stops zero.SuzhouSuzhou is known for its numerous gardens which like the sites we saw in Beijing and Xi’an are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. We toured the Master of the Nets Garden. These are private walled spaces made by the leading officials of the city for their own enjoyment that are now a treasure for the public.Another advantage of a group of only 10 people is that you can fit in 5-6 bicycle rickshaws or in 3 gondolas so we took a memorable ride through Suzhou’s traffic to the canals that cut through the old town.Suzhou has a number of canals that you can tour on a small gondola. Like in Venice a canal ride may include a serenade as ours did.ShanghaiShanghai has its gardens and teahouse from the Ming Dynasty but is in so many ways a thoroughly modern city. We stayed just off its main shopping street a quick walk from the Bund area which was the center of Shanghai in its colonial era. The Bund is across the river from the new skyscrapers of Pudong.Robert polled the group as we arrived at the city and we rearranged our schedule to do a walking tour to orient us with the city the day of our arrival so that people could have more free time the second day. By this time we were comfortable finding restaurants on our own which always seem to have a picture menu with something vaguely like English for people like us who don’t read Chinese (see Chinglish Menus Items in Shanghai, China), catch a cab or public transportation. My son had learned enough Mandarin to say “no thank you” to the many street vendors which proved much more effective than the same phrase in English.While in Shanghai, we attended the Shanghai Acrobatics show. The confidence that it takes to ride a motorcycle in the sphere of death is probably more than it takes to explore a country like China, but a tour like the China Highlights tour does not just show you the sites but also gives you more confidence as a traveler.I had two different impressions after our tour. The first is that I think I would now have the confidence to travel to China on my own. The second was that I would certainly look at an Intrepid tour again. Even for confident travelers, sometimes it is awfully nice to have an Intrepid and a Robert looking out for you.See my China photosWe have a number of Amateur Traveler podcast episodes about China to give you more information. For a contrast to this tour, you might check out the episode we did on Traveling to Beijing, China with a Tour – Episode 187 which talks more about what a big bus tour of Beijing would be like. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/huanghuacheng-lakeside-great-wall-reserve-the-great-wall-of-china-in-water/,Huanghuacheng Lakeside Great Wall Reserve – The Great Wall of China in Water,China,"If you have visited the Great Wall of China and are looking for a different view, there is choice that combines the Chinese feng shui elements of mountains and water in a unique, beautiful setting. It is called the Great Wall in Water.In past years, my wife and I have visited the Great Wall of China on three previous occasions. Twice we took excursions that included both the Juyong Pass and Badaling sections of the Wall. Both of these sections are must-sees and even though they can be very crowded with tourists, I would still recommend them for a first visit. Last year we decided we wanted to get away from the crowds so we visited the restored Mutianyu section of the Wall. We also enjoyed this more remote section where you can ride a cable car to the top of the mountain and slide back down to the base on a toboggan track sled.Huanghuacheng Lakeside Great Wall ReserveThis July, my wife and I decided to to make a third trek to the Wall so we wanted to visit a section we had not seen before. Based on the recommendations of a few friends in Beijing, we decided to visit the Huanghuacheng Lakeside Great Wall Reserve located in the Huairou District of Beijing City – in English, this section is called either the Waterside Great Wall, Lakeside Great Wall, or Great Wall in Water. What makes this section of the Wall unique is that three sections of the Wall were submerged in water by the construction of the Haoming Lake reservoir. This has created an interesting effect whereby the Wall appears to be descending into the water. In actuality, the Wall has fallen apart where it reaches the water, but nonetheless the effect is dramatic and unique.The entrance to the reserve is reached by walking through Xishuiyu Village. After paying an admission fee equivalent to about 5 US dollars, visitors reach the reservoir area by either negotiating a steep stone stairway or by taking a series of long sloping pathways. At the top is the Haoming Lake dam and reservoir. Here you can either walk a pathway across suspension bridges around the reservoir or pay for a scenic boat ride to the reach the middle of the park. It is here where you get the best views of the Great Wall submerged in water.Boat RideGenerally, the boat ride is on a slow-moving multi-passenger tourist boat, but on the day we visited there were so few people that we traveled on a 9 passenger speed boat. It was actually a lot of fun zooming through the reservoir on the speed boat.The park is very beautiful and features well-marked trail signs in English. There is a small convenience store in the middle of the park that sells cold drinks, ice cream, and other snacks. For an extra fee, you can also rent a paddleboat or even take a ride on an amphibious vehicle.It appears that the Huanghuacheng Reserve was developed as a new Great Wall tourist area to relieve some of the crowds of Badaling, but so far it does not seem to be catching on with any great enthusiasm. Even though we visited in the height of the summer tourist season, there were very few people there. Almost every tourist was Chinese and most of the visitors seemed to belong to youth groups.Getting ThereIn my opinion, there are good reasons for the low number of tourists. For one, the drive to get there, even though very scenic, is not easy. You will definitely need an experienced driver. The roads were winding, narrow, and difficult to navigate. Often the locals had one lane blocked with piles of gravel and stone building materials they stored on the road. The second problem is that in the reserve, tourists are discouraged from walking on the Wall. Any first trip to the Great Wall has to involve a walk on the Wall.Hiking the WallWe did climb up on the wall and walked a small section.; No one bothered us this day, but there were signs posted that indicated we should not be there. It is possible that you may be allowed to walk on sections of the Wall at the end of the reserve, but these would take you out of the park into the Huanghuacheng and Jintang sections of the Wall. This is the area where various tour groups take hikers on undeveloped or wild sections of the Great Wall.My recommendation is that this would be a good place to visit the Wall after you have visited Badaling and Mutianyu. The images of the Wall going into the water are dramatically beautiful and the drive to get there, even though winding, is extremely scenic and adds a great deal to the experience. At the very least, the pristine setting, lack of crowds, and cool, clear mountain air are a pleasant relief from other areas of the Wall and Beijing.If you a looking for a new way to see the Wall, then hire a driver and visit the Great Wall in Water.Share this: "

Both of them were built to protect Chinese civilization and culture from the barbarians outside the Middle Kingdom. The first one is made of stone but the second one, the Great Firewall of China, is made of computers.The Great FirewallJust what is the Great Firewall of China? Internet traffic from outside of China has to pass through servers that filter some websites and block other websites completely. For example you can search on Google but you might not be able to search certain phrases like “Tiananmen Square” that might produce politically uncomfortable images for the Chinese Government. Social Networking sites are commonly blocked as well. The firewall also tries to block sites like child pornography to protect its citizens. All traffic that is leaving China can also be monitored by the government.Why Can’t I get to Facebook from China?China’s policy about the internet does not affect most outsiders until they travel to China. Then they start asking questions like “why can’t I get to Facebook from China?”. You are on vacation and you would love to tell mom and Uncle Billy about what a great time you are having but you can’t because Facebook is one of those sites that is blocked completely (as this site might soon be).Can I get around the Great Firewall of China?There are mechanisms for working around the Chinese web censorship. There are some sites like SecuriTales.com which will sell you a service that allows you reach sites like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Gmail from China. Technically what they are doing is connecting to the outside world through a proxy server and rerouting and encrypting your traffic to get through the firewall. If you know what all those terms mean you can probably setup your own free solution, but this is a great site for those of us who just want a simple solution. They even offer a 10 minute free trial.Before You GoBefore you go to China you can check if a particular website is blocked via a tool at Great Firewall of China. You should also expect that even if you get a fast connection in China, the firewall will slow down the connection to the rest of the world. Plan accordingly. Because of internet speeds you may not always be able to back up all your photos to the internet from your digital camera, for instance, so you may want to make sure you have other options to back up your photos like a portable hard drive or multiple memory cards.You should definitely go to China and see the original Great Wall. You need to be aware of the internet issues you may have but you should not let them stop you from visiting this wonderful country.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-why-china-will-never-rule-the-world/,Book Review – “Why China Will Never Rule the World”,China,"Troy Parfitt’s Why China Will Never Rule the World is a travelogue detailing three trips he made during his decade of teaching English in Taiwan. The first two trips are to the Chinese mainland, and the third trip is a journey through Taiwan. Throughout these trips, he travels to the Potala Palace in Tibet, the Ice Festival in Harbin and most of the major tourist destinations in between. The book is focused on what he sees and experiences as a tourist, though it is interspersed with large dollops of the history of the places that he is visiting, mostly summarizations of books Parfitt has read.As he hits most of the tourist spots in China, he often complains about the way the Chinese do not look out the window or how they do not read enough. He laments the constant haranguing he receives as a Western tourist, the “harlo” cat calls and the touts trying to cheat him. For four hundred pages, he piles up these complaints without really making any point. The title suggests that he is going to use his observations to answer questions about China’s future role in the world, but, he fails to even begin to answer the question that he sets out to answer. Instead, the reader is left with pages of his anger at the Chinese and little more. Parfitt seems to think that his complaints are enough for evidence that China will never rule the world, though he hardly tries to make that argument.Parts of Parfitt’s book do make for great reading. In general, it is a nice contrast to the encomiums pouring out of publishers with only praise for China. Parfitt takes on the task of seeing if China is actually all that people make it out to be, and he decides that it fails.At some points, Parfitt’s prose is vivid, and his descriptions of the landscapes are compelling. Lines like “unfurled fields of swaying jade adorned with brick homes and formations of karst, the craggy, luxuriant mountains” transport his readers to China. At some points, he is genuinely funny, but sometimes, he tries too hard to be funny.Parfitt’s strongest point comes when he details his discussions with the Chinese people he meets while traveling. These discussions are animated and often say a lot about the country. In one episode, Parfitt meets a woman who teaches Chinese to Korean students. The teacher finds it so strange that her Korean students have so much money compared to the Chinese even though the Koreans, in her words, simply copied Chinese “culture and language.” These episodes reveal what individuals in China really think, and these passages are the most important contribution this book makes to the on-going discussion of China.However, the book’s shortcomings dim these strong points so much that they are hard to see. Though this is Parfitt’s second book, he is not a good writer. Parfitt’s four hundred pages are written more like a book report than an actual book. The book is filled with clichés and bad writing. This bad writing is compounded by the fact that little editing was done. We get to learn what he eats for breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus what he watched on television before bed on most days of his trip. If he ate something interesting each day, this would not be a problem, but, in most cases, he is simply wasting a page detailing his trip to the local McDonalds. Granted, this is not entirely Parfitt’s fault. A good editor would have cut much of this and worked to improve his writing.Furthermore, Parfitt bounces from one topic to the next seemingly at random, starting a paragraph with one topic and, before finishing with that topic, moving on to another. Parfitt’s jumping from one topic to the next makes it difficult to figure out what point he is trying to make, and, for this reason, the book seems ever wandering in search of some new topic, never making a point about the topic it just picked up.Finally, the most problematic part of this book is Parfitt’s inability to adapt culturally. He really seems to despise the Chinese, which is strange considering he spent over a decade living in Taiwan. “… and not even the multitudes of Chinese tourists, their idiot grins and derisive greetings could dampen [my mood], although they definitely tried.” Though he is able to have interesting conversations with individual Chinese people, he is never able to overcome his general dislike of the Chinese populace.At one point in the book, he engages in a discussion with students about New Zealand. His students, Parfitt realizes, did not want to visit the country because pictures of New Zealand all showed scenes that were beautiful yet devoid of human beings, something that Parfitt thinks makes it a fantastic destination. “Nothing frightens the Chinese quite like the prospect of isolation.” He continues the rest of the page excoriating the Chinese for daring to value isolation and human contact differently than he does, for daring to think differently than Troy Parfitt does.Parfitt fails to adapt to Chinese culture. From what he has written, he seems to hate almost everything about it because it does not align with his value system. Parfitt has missed what makes travel so delicious, being confronted with values and situations that we are not used to and forcing ourselves to adapt to them.He may be right about China not being able to rule the world, or he may be wrong. Reading his book will not answer that question because he is not able to come to terms with the Chinese. He constantly seems to seek out fights with the Chinese. He never gets beyond the most basic book-learning of Chinese culture, leaving his description of the country and the problems which it is facing (and this reviewer agrees with Troy Parfitt – China has many problems) flat and of little value to someone wanting to understand China. This book has some positives, particularly at the points in which Parfitt does engage with Chinese people, but, for the most part, the author cannot help the reader understand China because he never tries to understand China himself.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/riding-the-night-train-in-china/,Riding the Night Train in China (with Video),China,"Picture a space like a hostel dorm room with 10 different recesses with 3 bunk beds on the right and 3 bunk beds on the left for 60 bunks in all. Then add a narrow hallway (3 feet wide) where people can congregate. Add a table and two fixed stools less than a foot wide outside of each of the recesses or door-less cabins. In the extra space in the hallway have someone bring a cart to sell you things periodically. Have a good mental picture? Add two hot water dispensers, two sinks and two hole in the floor style toilets. OK, now put this all on a train and you have a good picture of a night train in China.The night train is an interesting adventure. 60 people looking for personal space, 10 door-less cabins with some overhead and under-bunk space for luggage. Each cabin also had a table and a TV that you cannot turn off nor turn down. It was showing Chinese movies without subtitles until about 10 PM at night when it seemed to be showing heroes of the Communist Revolution as it played patriotic songs.Our tour group leader told us that the protocol was that the people who had the bottom bunk were expected to share them as a place to sit, but when the older women started to fluff the pillow and lie down we thought that was carrying the hospitality a bit far. We found out that there had been some confusion and she thought she was in her bunk instead of my wife’s.Once we clarified who was sleeping where some people climbed into their bunks because it was nice to have a space of your own, even if it was a small space. The width of the bunk was about the width of my shoulders and its length just long enough for my 6’ 3” frame. One of the two-night trains we took had a small night light in addition to a clothes hook.xian"" data-gyg-q=""xian"" data-gyg-widget=""activites"" data-gyg-href=""https://widget.getyourguide.com/PAKTIGU/activities.frame"">By 10 pm our train from Beijing to Xi’an grew quiet except for the occasional food cart coming through and the random loud snorer (of whom I am one of the worst offenders). For some, the gentle movement of the train lulled them into a restful slumber. For others, the train car seemed to lurch each time they got close to falling asleep as if part of some cosmic practical joke. On our first train ride, my wife slept soundly and I was kept awake but for some reason on our second trip, the roles were reversed.In the morning people started to stir as the sun came up. They stumbled down the hall to the toilet and sinks or changed their clothes under their blankets in preparation for our arrival. Our tour group leader warned us that the toilets would be locked for the last 30 minutes of the trip. By that point in the trip you might have appreciated a hazmat suit to enter them anyway. Let’s just say that with a hole in the floor style toilet, aim is not improved by the movement of the train.I should add that there are also options for better and worse accommodations. The cheaper accommodation is sleeping in a seat while the more expensive is a cabin with a door and 4 bunks.When we learned that our tour included two-night trains with only one night in a hotel between the two we were a bit apprehensive. When the second night train happened to be my wife’s birthday our uneasiness increased. But, it was an experience. I would ride the night train again in China if our plans called for it. My wife, however, will fly.This was part of  trip with Amateur Traveler listeners to China, read more at Intrepid Travel China – Review of China Highlights Tour (Beijing, Xian, Suzhou, Shanghai)Share this: "

Some restaurants though had restaurants in English as well. And some restaurants had menus in what appeared to be English but sometimes just raised more questions than they answered.

I would recommend the restaurant but order with care when you see these dishes.Millet pepper fell in love with small cockOK, let’s not be childish here.

https://amateurtraveler.com/disconsolate-at-the-consulate/,"Getting a Visa for China, Not so Fun as You May Imagine",China,"Unwelcome Surprise“That’s the old form” the clerk said.“But I got it off your website”, I protested.“No, that form is not on our website”.I stood there slightly flummoxed for a second. I was not quite sure what the clerk was telling me. Did she think i had forged the form? Was she saying that I had perhaps purposely brought in the wrong form? My eloquent response was to hold the form somewhat more prominently and say emphatically, “Yes, it is”.She was resolute. I would need to fill out the new (and longer) form.To be fair, although I had gotten this form from the website of the Chinese Consulate where I was standing, I knew that I had gotten it by doing a Google search for “Chinese visa”. My wife had looked for the form for some time and had not found it so a variety of thoughts were assailing my brain.I have just traveled for a couple of hours and waited here for a couple of hours for my number to be served and now I will not get a visa and will not be able to go to China.I wonder if someone did forget to take down the old visa form off the website.My wife, who said I should use a visa service, will definitely say “I told you so”.I have my son’s and my wife’s forms with their signatures. How will I get them to sign the new form?I wonder what other countries would be nice to visit this October?I was apparently not the first person to arrive with the wrong form. The clerk assured me that I could fill out the new form and she would attach the signature page of the older form. All hope was not lost. Another half hour to fill out the form, another half hour wait in line and my forms were all submitted. I thanked the clerk and made plans to return to San Francisco later in the week to pick up my forms. Like this visit the next would have to be in the middle of the day since I was both arriving by train and trying to arrive before the consulate doors closed at 2:30 PM.More SurprisesMy visas were scheduled to be ready on Thursday but I put off my return trip until Friday when I wanted to be in the city. I had made plans to meet up with a former guest on the Amateur Traveler and then meet my wife in the city for a weekend away. That, it turns out, was where my problem started for my second visit. Since I was going to do a walking tour of the city I had packed my SLR camera in my backpack. When I went to clear the security check I was told that cameras were not allowed.As it turns out, that is not exactly the rule as it is enforced. What is really not allowed is something that looks like a camera. I was allowed in with my cell phone which everyone knows has a camera as were many of the people in the consulate. I was allowed in with a laptop which has a video camera. I was allowed in on the previous occasion with a Flip Video camera. But what I was not allowed in with was this “camera”. I tried to reason with the guard that I was certainly not the only person with a camera. I tried to see if I could leave the camera in my bag. I tried to see if I could leave the camera at security. The guard did not make the rules but he certainly was planning on enforcing them. I could not enter.Fortunately I had reserved a hotel room for the night so I jumped back on a cross-town bus back to Union Square. I was able to check in early and dropped my whole backpack off in the room “just to be safe”. So much for getting more work done as I waited. I jumped back on a bus and returned to the consulate.I discovered that when I left my backpack behind I also left my receipt that I needed to pick up the visas. I got on the line of roughly 80 people waiting to pick up their visas and one kind soul told me that if you lose your receipt there is a form you can get from the information desk. I picked up the form and filled it out. I had to attach a copy of my driver’s license but there were copy machines there (also you can get your picture taken for your visa at the office). I returned to the line and waited my turn to get to the pick-up window… where I learned for the first time that I was supposed to return my “I am a stupid tourist who lost my form” form to the information desk. One more trip to that desk and then back to the head of the line to get my visa.Except this is not the line to get your visas, per say. This is the window at which you find out which of two other windows you need to queue up for to get your visas. So the clerk found my visas (my first real evidence that we were in fact going to be let into China), verified that one of the pictures looked like me in the set of 3 passports and then handed me a ticket that said I should go to window 1 to pay for my visas.I waited on line for the clerk at window 1 where the clerk found my visa in a shorter stack, verified that one of the pictures looked like me in the set of 3 passports, took my credit card and handed me back 3 passports with the visas in them.There are agencies who stay in business because they can get your visa for you. You fill in the form, pay them and send them your passport. They work the system and your passport return with the visa. This is what I used on my last visit to China. I have a renewed sense of the value of such a service.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/the-shanghai-world-expo-a-true-international-event/,The Shanghai World Expo: A True International Event,China,"Two years ago while visiting Shanghai, my wife and I saw an incredible media presentation about the upcoming World Expo that was being held in 2010.  Since I am a big fan of Expos and World Fairs, having attended 5 previous ones and the sites of 4 others after they closed, we made the decision that we would return to Shanghai to see the Expo.  What we did not realize is that in China this has become an event that rivals the Beijing Olympics. In fact, the Chinese claim to have spent more in preparation for the Shanghai Expo than the Olympics in 2008, and it is evident. Advertisements and images of the Expo’s Gumby-like mascot, Haibao, can be found throughout China and on every city block of the host city.  Shanghai has been transformed into a pristine world-class city worthy of hosting this major international gathering.The sheer enormity of the Shanghai Expo has made it a remarkable event (192 countries and over 50 international organizations have pavilions and displays).  This far exceeds any previous World’s Fair or Expo.  Also, attendance is projected to go over 70-100 million visitors for only a six-month period (so far the highest recorded day was July 17 with 557,200 visitors). In addition to being the most costly Expo ever, it is also by far the largest in size and scope.World Expos have captured our imaginations in the past because they have provided countries and businesses with the opportunity to advertise themselves and project the image they want other people from around the world to see.  Many Expos became noteworthy because they featured innovation and unique architecture.  The Shanghai Expo continues this great tradition by also excelling in all these areas.  Its unique pavilions, structures, and displays are stunning in their innovation and stretch the limits of visual creativity.My family and I had the opportunity to attend the Expo over four days in the beginning of August.  We had originally projected that five days would be enough to see everything, but a canceled flight from Newark to Shanghai reduced our visit.  Our estimates were totally inadequate. To seriously see the Expo and to take in all the major exhibits, it would probably take a person about 2 weeks.  Four days barely seemed to put a dent into fully enjoying everything the event had to offer.The Shanghai Expo is located in the Nanpu and Lupu Bridge region in the center of Shanghai just south of the famous Bund region.  The exposition is divided into 5 major zones that contain pavilions from countries, cities, businesses, and international organizations.  There are also sculpture gardens, shops, performance stages, a sports arena, and a major performing arts centre.The fun of any Expo is visiting the themed pavilions, particularly the national pavilions.  With 192 countries holding exhibits this becomes a major task in Shanghai.  Over our four days we had the opportunity to visit about 25 major pavilions and many minor ones.  Visiting a pavilion can take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes (even though waiting to get in can take much longer). Most major pavilions give presentations about their countries that are often divided into three parts.  The introductory section generally focuses on sharing the country’s heritage and history.  The second section is usually about culture and often shows people living their daily lives.  In most cases, the third section presents some environmental message that ties into the Expo’s theme of a “Better City, Better Life.”The most popular pavilion is hosted by China.  The waiting time to get in usually ranges from 5 to 10 hours. Other popular pavilions are hosted by Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, Korea, and Germany.  Waiting times for any of these pavilions is anywhere from 3 to 7 hours.  Fortunately, for us the lines to get in at most of the pavilions were an hour or less.  We were fortunate to visit many of the popular pavilions and found that indeed Saudi Arabia and the Emirates had excellent exhibits, but we also enjoyed other countries such as Thailand, Morocco, and Mexico.Our experiences at the pavilions became the highlight of our visit to the Expo. Part of the magic we experienced at the Expo came from stories and impressions we gained from each exhibit as well as the reaction of the Chinese visitors. Each pavilion seemed to take on its own unique character and often revealed interesting insights into people and culture.I was excited to visit the French pavilion, because I had read that it featured six paintings and one sculpture on loan from the Musée d’Orsay.  When I arrived at the area where the artwork was featured, I found much to my amazement that there were very few people there.  I was puzzled, because in my mind this was the highlight of the pavilion, and I thought it would be packed with visitors. I gained a quick lesson on cultural differences when I soon noticed that the Louis Vuitton area was the most crowded.  Apparently the Chinese visitors were much more interested in current fashions than historic art pieces.Exhibits at other pavilions were often puzzling to understand.  The Spanish pavilion is one of the architectural highlights of the Expo because it is a large irregular shaped structure covered in wicker that is crafted to reveal Chinese characters.  We were excited to see this exhibit and waited about 90 minutes to get in.  The first room was alive with images, music and the sounds of Flamenco.  In the middle of all this were actual dancers who performed throughout the day.  The next section continued to build excitement by featuring larger than life moving images of Spanish cities along with beautiful scenic vistas.  After this we were anticipating an incredible finale, but found that the third room was a cavernous hall that contained an enormous life-like moving statue of baby.  Even more bizarre were the bubbles floating down from the ceiling.  Almost everyone stood there looking at the statue with puzzled expressions on their faces.  After a few minutes we began to laugh, because we didn’t know what to think.  I’m sure this was significant in some artist’s mind, or maybe the Spanish were simply having fun with us.  We are still not sure what they were trying to say, but it sure was memorable.Clearly through the preparation and enormity of the event the Chinese were looking to make a strong statement about the strength of their country and people.  Nowhere was this more evident than the dominance and massiveness of the crown-like Chinese pavilion.  It towers above the other pavilions and is the center focal point of the Expo.  It is impressive in every way from the ascending process each visitor has to take to enter the pavilion to the innovativeness of the exhibits.  Ironically after spending over two hours viewing every exhibit in the building, I seem to have forgotten most of it.  But one image does firmly stick in my mind.At one point we boarded a Disney-like train ride that took us into a fantasy like world of achievements in China’s urban development from ancient to modern times. In the front of each car was a young Chinese woman dressed in a uniform who waved robotically to greet visitors. As soon as the car was out of sight of the ride operators the first thing the young woman did was uncharacteristically drop her perfect behavior, take out her cell phone, and check her text messages. Quickly I was reminded in this small way that regardless of the cultural differences, human behavior around the world is remarkably the same.  This was the normal reaction by any teenager anywhere in the world to being bored.I must admit that I had some trepidation on how my home country would present itself.  After reading many negative comments online, I was prepared for the worst.  But quite the contrary, I thought the experience at the United States pavilion was one of the best. Clearly the organizers had given great thought to handling large numbers of visitors each day, and they prepared a pavilion that would smoothly move people from one exhibit to the next while entertaining them at each stage.The presentation began with an amusing video showing every day Americans trying to pronounce Chinese words.  This set a great tone, because it showed us as Americans laughing at ourselves at not being able to accomplish the simple task of saying a few Chinese words. The Chinese visitors laughed warmly and really seemed to appreciate the humor.  The second section contained a three-screen movie featuring various well-known Americans as well as our President and Secretary of State talking about innovation and sustainable development.  The third area was an entertaining multi-media presentation about a young girl trying to build a community garden in her city.  All three sections were entertaining and warmly received by the visitors.  The staff at the United States Pavilion also seemed to go out of their way to make everyone feel welcomed and valued.I felt fortunate to spend four days at the Expo with my family.  It is an amazing event that I would recommend to everyone.   If you enjoy learning about other countries and want to experience a truly international event, then consider this a unique opportunity to experience the culture of almost every nation in the world in one relatively small area.  If you are a fan of Expos or World’s Fairs you have to go, but make arrangements soon.  The Expo officially ends way to soon on October 30, 2010.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/cartagena-colombia/,"What You Need to Know About Cartagena, Colombia",Colombia,"What You Need to Know About CartagenaCartagena is Colombia’s fifth-largest city and the most popular for foreign and domestic tourists alike. Cruise ships have been stopping here for years, but it’s so much more than a day trip, hop-off destination. The city is vibrant and bursting with contrasts: slow-moving and fast-talking, wealth alongside poverty, ruled by functional chaos. You’ll be served soup in 90-degree weather, see old ladies and toddlers dance to salsa in the street, and try fruits you’ve never heard of.Plaza de San PedroThe oppressive Caribbean heat isn’t for the faint-hearted, so we recommend three to five days to explore the city. Here’s what you should know:It’s loaded with history.Cartagena’s Centro, often referred to as “the Old City” in guidebooks or “the Walled City” by locals, was conquered by the Spanish in 1533. The walls have seen pirate attacks, slave traders, and naval battles, as well as waves of artists, writers, musicians, and intellectuals. Check out the iconic Castillo de San Felipe fortress in the morning or early evening to avoid the heat. It was built on a hill in the 1600s by the Spanish, and even if you’re not a history buff you can appreciate the solid architecture and eerie underground tunnels. Later, spend an afternoon in one of Cartagena’s air-conditioned museums like the Palace of the Inquisition, the Naval Museum and the Gold Museum.La MurallaConsider getting your beach time somewhere else.Cartagena hugs the Caribbean ocean and the waterfront sunsets are spectacular. Playa Blanca is Cartagena’s most popular option, and gorgeous blue water framed by palm trees will fulfill your Caribbean dreams – if you can find a space among the crowds. Unfortunately, rapid overdevelopment has had a harsh impact on the ecosystem surrounding Playa Blanca and the Rosario Islands, so we recommend skipping those tours. For a local beach day, try Tierra Bomba or La Boquilla, two options closer to the city and less crowded. La Boquilla has a few kitesurfing schools if you want to try something more extreme. However, if you’re looking for that white sand, photograph-worthy experience, you might be better off finding your way up the coast to Santa Marta (4-5 hours by bus). Parque Tayrona and the surrounding beaches can be a delightful natural contrast to Cartagena’s cobblestones.La Boquilla BeachIt’s cheap! (But not that cheap.)The dollar (or Euro) to the peso exchange rate is in your favor right now, so you can arrange an enjoyable visit without spending a fortune. Cartagena is a tourist town though, and prices have been adjusting to agree with the rising dollar. This means hotel and rental prices are slowly increasing, so you’ll want to shop around when booking. Still, a beer is around $1 USD, a cab ride $3-4 and a fancy dinner for two can be easily found for under $50. Sunset on the wall Things happen on the street. Sometimes tourists tend to stick to the sterilized, air-conditioned world, but you can access plenty of food, entertainment and shopping in Cartagena right outside. Shop for souvenirs, jewelry, and art on the wall or around the major churches like the Cathedral, and don’t be afraid to bargain a bit! Grab a snack from a vendor – fresh-cut fruit, coconut water, fried arepas de huevo and deditos de queso are around every corner and a good way to try typical cuisine. You’ll also see living statues and street performers, as well as musicians as the sunsets. Plaza Trinidad in the Getsemaní neighborhood always has something going on after dark, even if it’s just a local Zumba class (join in!)*Please pass on the horse and carriage, though, and opt for walking or biking. There has been ongoing controversy about the animals’ treatment.Wares in the CentroYou don’t have to do anything.Did we mention the heat? Cartagena is hot. While you might get a breeze sneaking through the walled Centro from November to March, the temperature consistently hovers around 90 with 90-100% humidity. Luckily, the Centro and Getsemaní are perfect for lazy exploring. Wander around to admire the street art full of social and cultural commentary, the intricate doors and the architecture, then post up at a cafe with a cold Aguila beer or a maracuya (passion fruit) cocktail to read, chat or people watch. Cartagena’s best entertainment occurs around 6pm when you can catch a brilliant sunset over the ocean from the top of the wall. An afternoon in your hotel pool or hammock isn’t a bad option either.Street in GetsemaníSpanish Makes a DifferenceAs Colombia’s main tourism hub, Cartagena can be navigated without speaking the language. Most hotels, tourist attractions, and transportation agencies will have staff with basic English skills or at least a translated brochure, and many restaurants feature bilingual menus. That being said, we think it’s easier to dive deeper into the coastal Colombian culture with knowledge of Spanish. People from Cartagena, cartageneros or costeños, speak rapid, somewhat blunt Spanish with a heavy accent, but they love to talk, especially about their city and culture. Striking up conversations with locals can give you insight that no brochure or audio guide ever could (and it will help you negotiate taxi fares!) and can create true cultural exchange that goes beyond tourism. If you don’t speak any Spanish, that’s ok too!

https://amateurtraveler.com/6-amazing-must-see-places-2017/,6 Amazing Must See Places for 2017,Colombia,"“The gladdest moment in human life, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands.” – Sir Richard BurtonSummer is almost upon us and for many, that means thinking about our yearly vacation. The budget airline revolution and strong US dollar have made it more affordable than ever to take that dream trip. So where should you go? Whether you’re a lay on the beach type or a cultural city explorer, this list has something for everyone. Here are 7 excellent places to blow off steam in 2017:1. PortugalAlta Duoro PortugalThe oft-forgotten gem of Western Europe, Portugal has rebounded financially since the global recession. The capital, Lisbon, is in the midst of a gastronomic revolution, making the most of fabulous fresh fish and local products of the lush Mediterranean climate.Lisbon is a city of contrast, in which, the sublime black and white tilework clashes with red clay rooftops and the vibrant azure of the Rio Tejo delta.To the south, the stunning grottos of the Algarve are dotted with secretive beaches.In the North, you’ll find Porto at the mouth of the river Douro. The birthplace of Port wine and home to some the world’s best vintners. A Douro valley cruise is a must for true wine enthusiasts, and a delightful journey for all.Overall, Portugal has a ton to offer in a tiny compact (affordable) package.2. Croatian CoastCroatia Coast, photo from pixabay.comCroatia’s tourism industry is just before the fever pitch. With a little help from Game of Thrones, Westerners are finally flocking to the gem of the Adriatic. The picturesque castle of Dubrovnik (you may recognize it as King’s Landing), sits on crystal clear inlets and alcoves.Locals recommend an island hop from Korcula, to Brac, to party central Hvar, and finally to Pag, where you’ll find stellar artisanal cheese. On Pag, you’ll feel a world away from your troubles on the barren rocky surface often likened to the surface of the Moon. Nearby Zadar is famous for a majestic sunset Alfred Hitchcock once lauded as “the world’s most beautiful.” Roman ruins are ubiquitous and especially worthwhile in the Istrian city of Pula, which features one of Europe’s best preserved amphitheatres.Croatia is fully recovered from the tumultuous 90’s and ready to take you in, it’s best to take advantage before everyone else takes notice.3. DenmarkCanal boat in Copenhagen, photo from pixabay.comIn the capital, Copenhagen, you’ll find an eclectic mix of the contemporary and the classic. The architecture offers a delightful clash between the ancient sea foam rusted copper roofs and modern compositions, like the flowing Opera House. The exploding food scene, likewise, ebbs between traditional open faced sandwiches, and the truly experimental creations of nouveau culinary legends. Copenhagen is also home to Mikkeller Brewing, which constantly pumps out some outlandishly delicious craft brews.Furthermore, Denmark’s second city, Aarhus, is the European Capital of Culture for 2017. The often-ignored locale is home to Denmark’s largest university so there is no shortage of vibrant, innovative culture, and nightlife.The typically Scandinavian architecture along the quaint riverfront is, in itself enough to merit a visit. The Danes speak excellent English and are very open to explaining their unique lifestyle.4. AustraliaSydney Opera House, photo from pixabay.comAustralia is a tried and true destination. The pristine beaches, world class surf, and fantastic cities have been attracting tourists for decades. So why now? The Australian Dollar has cratered making a traditionally expensive destination affordable for the rest of the world. Furthermore, global warming and pollution continue to threaten the gargantuan Great Barrier Reef with extinction. Close to ⅔ of the reef is in danger of deadly “bleaching”, so there’s no time like the present. Budget airlines and economic trends make now the time to visit the land down under.5. CanadaBow Lake – Banff National Park, photo from pixabay.comCanada is celebrating a big birthday this year. 2017 marks the nation’s 150th year, and gives you a reason to visit the second biggest country in the world. From Vancouver in the West to Prince Edward Island in the East, Canada consistently delivers beautiful natural wonders. Alberta’s Banff National Park is well worth a visit.The cultural capital of Toronto is a cosmopolitan metropolis with a completely idyllic mixture of people from all over the planet. The contrasting Montreal is an enclave of a singular Quebecois mind-set, where you can find francophone food and a proud local heritage. Likewise, the languishing Canadian Dollar makes it a great time to join in the birthday party.6. ColombiaSalento Colombia, photo from pixabay.comBest known in the 90’s for a slew of cocaine fuelled violence, Colombia has calmed down in recent years. Growing interest in the drug kingpins, spurred by numerous documentaries and Netflix’s Narcos, has made the interior cities of Bogota, Medellin tourist attractions. It’s finally safe to visit their exquisite rolling hills.Former rival Cali, is the jewel of the pacific coast, and Cartegena is the capital of the post Columbian Caribbean. A rising star is the oldest inhabited colonial city of Santa Marta where you can see history in motion. Colombian cuisine and culture is in the midst of a velvet revolution and it could be cool to see a small part of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-misspelled-paradise-bryanna-plog/,Book Review: “Misspelled Paradise” by Bryanna Plog,Colombia,"I volunteered to review “Misspelled Paradise” hoping it would help me prepare for a trip to Central America.  It did provide me some insights to the culture in that part of our hemisphere, but not as much as I hoped.  This was not the fault of the book or the author.  I learned that some of the assumptions I had made were incorrect about Central and South America being the same.This is not your average travel guide, in fact it is not a travel guide at all, and it is the experiences of the author.  Bryanna Plog lived and in Columbia and taught English as a volunteer teacher for a year.  You get to experience her year from the urban feel of Bogota to the small island where she taught in Santa Anna.  She explored all the other area of Colombia including the desert of the Guaijira peninsula, the jungles of the Amazon and the rainforest of Southern Colombia.You get to understand the sense of her frustration as the job she went to do, to teach English, is made near to impossible by a flawed and barely functioning school system.Bryanna shows genuine affection for her students and the people of Santa Ana, the island where she lived and volunteered.I recommend this book.  The story kept me engaged and reading. It is an enjoyable read, not too deep, and just funny enough that you want to see what is next. Disclosure: A free copy of this book was given to a volunteer with the expectation that a fair and honest review would be written for it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/bogota-experience-%e2%88%92-48-hours/,48 Hours in Bogotá Colombia,Colombia,"Back in the ’90s, you’d be hard-pressed to convince anyone that Colombia might become the tourism hub that it is today. The nation has had a violent past, but many reaches of the nation have become safer due to improved infrastructure and a heightened presence of authority. Today, Colombia’s capital, Bogotá, has become a bona fide metropolis with enough diversity and destinations to cater to the tastes of any traveler.With so many people to meet and places to discover, getting the whole picture of Bogotá can be dizzying even within the span of a year. Nevertheless, if you find yourself on a tighter schedule, here are some ways to experience the essence of Bogotá in 48 hours.Visiting La CandelariaOnce you’ve arrived, there are a few places that I’d recommend first. For some historical background on the city, in addition to finding some perspective on how vastly Bogotá has progressed and changed over the decades, I’d recommend first seeing the old city: La Candelaria. Even if you’d rather spend time enjoying other activities, at least walking by to appreciate the historical Spanish colonial architecture is worthwhile. La Candelaria also features landmarks like Simon Bolivar’s statue and notable buildings including El Museo de Oro, Museo Botero, and MamBo. Depending on your museum of choice, you’ll find exhibits of some the most eccentric and prestigious art and artifacts from the likes of Picasso, Monet, and more. There are also large prominent cathedrals and theaters throughout this dense area for tourists to explore.However, the most essential way to experience the area is to make a pilgrimage to the mountain of Monserrate, which peaks near the center of Bogotá and lays in view high throughout the city. This hilltop area contains an impressive church, upper scale restaurants, and all manners of facilities for tourists. For a view, tourists generally prefer to access this peak via a scenic aerial tram. However, traditionalists and athletes might prefer to make the trip in the old way – by climbing. I’d recommend anyone to spend one of their days in Bogotá by climbing to this peak, which is one of the most symbolic reaches of the nation.Other Popular DestinationsHow you’ll spend day two would depend on your personal interests, and given the great array of destinations, how to manage it would be up to you. One popular area is Chapinero, which is a much more modern and business-oriented district as opposed to the old city. This bustling downtown region features hundreds of shopping centers and a vivid nightlife scene, including the world-famous nightlife hub of Parque de la 93.El Salitre is an ideal biking destination and includes several other fields where tourists can enjoy all varieties of sports, including many open fields and parks which are always populated with games of soccer and other recreational activities. This area is also a central hub for the city’s bus system, making it an ideal place to find your lodging to easily access travel – though the hotels of Ciudad Salitre tend to be higher in the price range.While so much to do should merit more than 48 hours, you should feel confident that there is never a shortage of things to explore in this Latin American metropolis. It can be worthwhile to research your potential lodging beforehand to ensure that you’re sleeping in a more affordable hotel in a district situated conveniently for the sites that you want to see.Navigating the streets and finding lodgingBefore arriving, it’s important to either use a guide or a map to make heads and tails of the roads. Streets around older historic areas such as the popular La Candelaria district are laid out with central plazas, which can be unusual for those unfamiliar with this road system. Additionally, more contemporary areas often have different structures entirely. Hotel managers usually recognize that Bogotá can be difficult to navigate for most tourists, which is why hotels on main streets in shopping and business areas charge an even higher premium than usually expected in prime locations.It can be worthwhile to research your potential lodging beforehand to ensure that you’re sleeping in a more affordable hotel in a safe district. There are affordable options near tourist-oriented areas, and these are far preferable than finding hotels in the countryside. These areas are generally less welcoming to tourists and the time spent traveling to and fro can keep you from enjoying the sights.Ciclorutas de BogotáWith only two days to spend, you might be tempted to step straight onto the shuttles or taxis that frequent airports and travel throughout the city. But to travel like a true Colombian (and to avoid the potential hours-long wait on these overcrowded forms of travel), I strongly suggest considering bringing a bike. The biking network, called the Ciclorutas de Bogotá by locals, stretches over 300 kilometers while covering the historical district, shopping areas, sporting centers, and even back-road pathways. These bike routes are extremely convenient and frequently used by the locals. On a daily basis, several hundred thousand people use these paths to make their daily trips to work and school. You might spend up to several hours of your visit on your bike, but the views afforded by these paths are well worth the time spent. These routes are constructed with Bogotá’s varied topography in mind, ensuring that most main paths have incredible views of the cityscape. In fact, many tourists opt to take special bike tours offered by some agencies to take advantage of this special travel option.Dining on diversityRegardless of what you enjoy, there are plenty of options available from street cooks, fruit and juice vendors, and various small cafes popular around dense tourism areas. There are even fast food vendors and sushi places available throughout the streets for a quick fix, but I’d strongly recommend checking out some more traditional fare for a more authentic experience. Tamales and chicharrón (or fried pig and chicken skins with spice) are very popular street fare. Ajiaco and sancocho are two different types of stew dishes that are extremely widespread in the area, and most places tend to serve their own special variations to twist the recipe.These are essentially meat stews full of aromatic spices and vegetables. Ajiaco usually contains chicken, different kinds of potatoes, and guascas – although considered a weed by most, it is essential in giving ajiaco its hearty, distinct flavor. Sancocho is a lighter meat dish of chicken or fish (and occasionally even oxtail) with plantain bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, and various other herbs and spices. These two dishes are crafted with so many variations that you could spend your entire stay enjoying them without ever tiring of their fresh, unique flavors.Regardless of how you choose to spend your time in Colombia, following these tips will help guarantee that your time is exciting and memorable– no matter what your tastes are.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/cruising-to-havana-cuba/,"Cruising to Havana, Cuba",Cuba,"Are you interested in visiting Cuba?  I have been for the past few years, but I was somewhat reluctant based on mixed reviews.  Professional travel writers have widely praised Cuba, but many actual travelers have given it a less than satisfactory critique.  Many of the criticisms have centered around the high costs and poor accommodations.   So I wondered, was there a way to just get a taste of Cuba without the full commitment of an expensive week-long tour?  Over the past year, I received information about various cruise lines that have scheduled Havana and a few other Cuban cities as ports of call.  The cruises were very affordable, and they offered a day or two in a Cuban city.  When an itinerary came through that featured a stop in both Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, I decided to take a chance.My adult daughter and I booked a 4-night cruise for early August that departed from Port Canaveral.  The highlight of the tour was a 24-hour stay in Havana that allowed for day and night touring of the city.  I knew that as an American citizen there were travel restrictions that I had to follow to visit Cuba.  Amazingly, the process turned out to be remarkably easy.  To secure my Cuba visa, I paid a $75 fee to the cruise line.  They took care of everything.  To fulfill my Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) People-to-People requirement, I booked a morning tour of Havana and an evening trip to the night time show at the Tropicana.  The cruise line allowed me to document my programs online and will keep my travel affidavit for the next 5-years.Even though all of this seemed easy, I still had some concerns about Cuba.   Visiting the tropics in the summer seemed like a potentially hot and tiring experience.  Surprisingly, the temperatures in Key West and Havana were about the same as I was experiencing in the Northeastern United States.  The humidity was a little higher and the sun was definitely stronger, but the ocean breezes in both towns made our visits comfortable.  We also scheduled our major sightseeing excursions for the morning and night to stay away from the higher afternoon temperatures.Our cruise ship, the Norwegian Sun,  was an older ship that seemed to have many mixed reviews.  The cruise lines appear to use smaller cruise ships that hold around 2000 people for stops in Havana.  Most likely this is due to the limited capacity of the Havana cruise terminal and the difficulties of navigating Havana Bay.  My concerns regarding the ship turned out to be unfounded.  The ship was delightful, reasonably priced, and even included an open bar.  I was also concerned about how I would be treated as an American in Cuba.Would I be watched by the Cuban government?Would the people of Cuba be hostile to Americans?None of these concerns was an issue in Cuba.  Tourists from all countries had access to the city, and the people graciously welcomed us.It is important to keep in mind that American tourists are permitted to visit Havana to experience its culture, history, and people.  The fun-in-the sun experience for our cruise was reserved for the ship and Key West.   As it turned out, Key West was a great way to begin our cruise.  The quirkiness of the city meant that we would start on a fun note.  This was my third visit to Key West, but it was the first for my daughter.  We decided to be very touristy for the day and began by taking a historical tour on the Conch Train.  Next, we ate lunch at Sloppy Joe’s Bar where we ate their famous Sloppy Joe sandwiches and drank Sloppy Ritas.   Later, we visited the Hemingway House where we had an informative docent guided tour.  We finished by having a memorable dessert of frozen chocolate covered Key Lime pie.The next stop on our itinerary was our much anticipated day in Havana, Cuba.   We planned a full day of activities in Havana to make the most of our time there.  Our ship entered the Bay of Havana just as the sun was rising.  I woke early to experience sailing into the city through the Canal de Entrada waterway that led to Havana Harbor.  It was an amazing site as the city took on a misty orange color from the rising sun.  It looked so old, and it felt like we had sailed back in time to an era that had long disappeared in the rest of the Caribbean.  The experience was so serene and mystical.  I was especially amazed at the quietness of the city.  There seemed to be very little traffic along the waterfront and very little activity elsewhere in the city.  The contrast of the modern cruise ship amongst the old, worn gray buildings was a sight that I will never forget.We had purchased two tour excursions to make sure that we were OFAC compliant: The Ultimate Highlights of Havana – Old & New city tour for the morning and the Legendary Tropicana Cabaret for the evening.  There were 1400 people taking tours in the morning, but the cruise ship was well organized and people departed in a quick, orderly fashion.  Getting through Cuban immigration was very easy.  When we got to the Cuba immigration station in the cruise terminal, an officer took our visa and stamped our passport.  The visa was only needed for the first entry.  All we had to do was show our passport when we re-entered later in the day.The Parque Martires del 71 at sunriseOn the way through the cruise terminal, we had the opportunity to exchange money.  The exchange rate for American dollars to Cuban Convertible pesos (CUCs) was one-to-one.  We found CUCs to be very useful when touring on our own in the Old Town section of the city.  The stops made on the cruise tours took both American dollars and CUCs.  The Cuban government charged a 13% commission to purchase CUCs.  They also charged another 13% commission to convert unused CUCs back to American dollars.  We found that when we paid with American dollars on the tours, government run locations still charged the 13% commission.  Independent retailers often do not charge the commission.Our bus had a tour guide who was very knowledgeable about Havana and very open about her life in Cuba.  She was willing to answer any question that was asked of her, and she encouraged us to ask anything we wanted.  Many people asked questions, and there was a lot of exchange back and forth.  Most of us were amazed at how the Cuban people survive on a small amount of money each month along with a few government provisions.Our cruise ship docked in Havana Harbor next to Old HavanaAlong the way, we were given constant narration about the areas we saw outside the windows of our bus.  The tour bus drove through La Habana Vieja (Old Havana); made a stop at Revolution Square; drove slowly through the Cristobol de Colon Cemetery; drove through the Miramar section of newer Havana; drove along the Malecon; stopped at the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña for sightseeing and shopping; and stopped at the statue, El Cristo de La Habana, for an overview of the city of Havana.It was a hot day, so the combination of seeing sites from the bus was well balanced with the three stops.  The tour began around 9:30 AM and ended at 1 PM at the cruise ship terminal.  We really enjoyed the tour and felt that we had seen a lot in a short amount of time.The statue of El Cristo de La Habana overlooking Havana HarborI purchased some Cuban cigars for family members at the government store at the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña.  We also purchased decorative souvenirs at an independent stand located in the bus parking lot at the fort.  The selection seemed small, but we did not see many different choices in the streets and vendors of Old Havana.  We also found that the prices were similar regardless of where we shopped.  Unlike the government stores, the independent merchants at the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña were willing to bargain, especially if we were buying multiple items.  We used American dollars and were not charged with any exchange fees.A partially restored street in Old HavanaRestored American Classic Cars in Revolution SquareAfter this, my daughter and I did our own walking tour of the plazas and architecture of Old Havana.  There were some restored sections, but also many that showed their age.  It was fascinating to see the people of Cuba going about their daily lives.  The restored American classic cars added an unbelievable color and excitement to the grayness of the buildings.  The cars serve mainly as taxis and can be found everywhere there are tourists.The exterior of La Bodeguita de MediaAfter walking for a while, we were hungry, so we decided to seek a Cuban meal at the La Bodeguita de Media which was famous as the birthplace of Mojito and as a regular hangout of Ernest Hemingway.  We later found out that both of these stories may or may not be true.  Our lunch was basic Cuban fare, but tasty.   It consisted of shredded beef flavored with a little green pepper, beans, rice, toasted fried plantains, croquettes, and of course, some mojitos.  Even though the bar and restaurant were touristy, we felt that we had experienced a little bit of Cuban culture.  We even left our mark by writing our names on the wall as multitudes of patrons have done over the years.The Plaza de San Francisco in Old HavanaAfter lunch, we walked towards Centro Habana, the downtown government and business section of Havana.  We saw many more people going about their daily life and noticed that the longest line of the day was at the government-run cell phone store.A bookstore in Centro HabanaWe visited bookshops, artist stalls, souvenir stores, restaurants, and old hotels.  There were many people, but not much buying was going on.  By around 3:30 PM, I felt I had too much sun, so I headed back to the cruise ship for a rest.  My daughter toured more plazas in the southern section of Old Havana for another hour.The cabaret at the Legendary TropicanaAt night, our show at the Legendary Tropicana began at 10 PM.  We arrived an hour early and used the time to get acquainted with the theater, select our seats, and meet the other people attending the cabaret.  The show was performed outside, and even though we were there in summer, the temperatures were still relatively comfortable.  There was a dress code for men and women.  Men were required to wear slacks and a collared shirt.  No shorts or flip flops were allowed.  We wished to take photographs during the show, so we had to pay an additional charge of $5 for a photo pass.  We were glad that we bought the pass.On the way in, each person received a cigar in a glass tube.  We were told that sometimes the women receive flowers, but for this performance, the women also received a cigar.  Smoking was permitted during the show, but fortunately, no on in our group smoked.  We were assigned to sit at long tables very close to the right, front side of the stage.  They were good, close seats.The price of admission included a glass of champagne, a bottle of Coca Cola, a bottle of Havana Club rum to be shared by four people, a snack bowl of nuts, and a piece of chocolate.  The waiters did not serve these items until the show began, most likely because they wanted us to buy drinks while we were waiting.  We did buy frozen strawberry daiquiris and some bottled water.  The daiquiris were very good and price was reasonable.The cabaret lasted for about 1 hour and 45 minutes.  It was performed non-stop and consisted of constant singing, dancing, incredible colorful costumes, and even some acrobatics.  It was very entertaining and lively.  One song seemed to blend into the other and the performers often came out to dance in the aisles of the theater.  At the end, various patrons were asked to join the dances in the aisles and on stage.  Even though all the singing was entirely in Spanish, we we were able to understand most of what was going on.  Visiting the Tropicana was an opportunity to take a step back in time to experience an era of entertainment that has long since disappeared.  Overall it was an enjoyable night, and we were glad that we stayed out late.Plaza de la Catedral de la Virgen María de la Concepción InmaculadaWe woke up early the next morning as the ship departed the harbor of Havana.  During our last day at sea, we had some time to reflect on our cruise itinerary.  We really enjoyed the contrast between the contemporary fun of Key West and the historical exploration of Havana.  During our short stay in Havana, we did gain some insight into the history, culture, and people of Cuba.  That was what we were looking for, and we were very pleased with our exposure to Cuba.  It also did make us want to see more.  We accomplished our goal and were really pleased with our overall experience.Barry Kramer and daughter, Liz, in Revolution SquareIf you like cruising, are interested in Cuba, or just like visiting new and unique places, then consider a cruise to one or more Cuban cities.   My daughter and I were curious about Havana and found that it exceeded our expectations.  The mix of history, culture, and friendliness of the Cuban people captured our hearts.  The cruise itself was very enjoyable, and we definitely increased our overall awareness and understanding of Cuba.  Using a cruise ship as our home base made Cuba easily accessible, comfortable, and affordable.  It is definitely a travel option that you may want to consider if you want to satisfy your curiosity about visiting Cuba. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-lost-cuba-celso-gonzalez-falla/,Book Review: “My Lost Cuba” by Celso Gonzalez-Falla,Cuba,"“My Lost Cuba” focuses on an affluent farming family during the 1950′s. Mike, the eldest son is summoned back to Cuba from his college studies in the United States to help out with the family business. Unlike his father, he is much more at ease with the workers and seems to be eager to see changes in Cuba. It is through Mike that we learn much about the lives of the ‘common man’ during this period of historyAs a piece that gives insight into the social history of Cuba, this book is amazing. As a novel, however, I found the lacking. The story is simplistic and the tone is rather didactic. And in places it comes across as a book meant to teach history.  Crises emerge to show the reader the precarious nature of the Cuban government than to forward the plot. In the end I did not figure out how every single individual that needed to finds a love interest by the end of the book.This book definitely satisfied my need to understand more about pre-Communist Cuba. It was insightful and interesting from a historical point of view. It is not, however, the type of book I would recommend to take on your beach vacation to Cuba. Unless you normally sun yourself by the pool with a huge tome of history, My Lost Cuba will not fit the bill. It is a book more for history buffs than those looking for a literary romp where they might learn something.Full disclosure : This book was provided to the volunteer by the publisher in exchange for a fair and honest review.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/cyprus-village-life/,Cyprus Village Life,Cyprus,"Cyprus Village LifeThere are no trains, crowds, or food stands. You won’t find any of these signature city attributes in a Cypriot village. The average traveler visits the popular attractions of a destination, soaking in local culture and history, but rarely engages with the true personality of the area. Cyprus is certainly not the exception because when you visit the city of Limassol you’ll find the promenade, the water park, and the ancient ruins, but will you truly understand what Cyprus has to offer?My parents, who grew up in Cyprus, were raised during a time when villages still operated as fully functional societies. Each village had a school, a doctor, a church, and market, so everyone was able to meet their needs without having to travel to another village. My grandmother lived in one village her entire life and only left once when she was married and another time when she visited us in the United States.During my visit to Cyprus, I had an amazing time living the simple life in a tiny village named Tris Elies. The day would begin with a breakfast consisting of cereal, eggs, fruit, and halloumi If you’re not familiar, halloumi is a wonderful cheese that does not melt when fried, creating a deliciously unique dining experience. After, breakfast, my family and I would venture down to my grandfather’s coffee shop. Since most of Cyprus consists of mountainous terrain, walking to the coffee shop from the house was always an adventure. The roads were narrow and the cement was patch worked together over dozens of years by local village dwellers. Beautiful grape vines grew everywhere from any crevice or crack in the cement, crawling up walls and over awnings.Coffee ShopThe coffee shop was the center of village recreational life. During my visit, anyone who lived in Tris Elies was retired so for most, the coffee shop was where much of the day was spent. Everyone who visited was brimming with interesting stories and wonderful personalities. The coffee shop bred a friendly atmosphere were everyone was relaxed and looked forward to chatting with their neighbors. In addition to talking, time was passed playing backgammon and poker. There’s nothing like spending an entire day playing backgammon with a few friendly guys while they sharing entertaining stories from their pasts.Memories and ChangesEven though I visited the village for just a few months, I created many fond memories of my own. A man by the name of Anixagoras became very good friends with my brother Paul during our short stay. They would meet each other every night for a walk around the mountains and then sit and talk in the coffee shop for some time. Before one of their walks, Anixagoras offered my brother a piece of chocolate. My brother thought the chocolate looked a little odd so he took it to my grandfather who said it was perfectly okay to eat. My brother tasted the ‘chocolate’ and immediately fled to the nearest sink. After witnessing this, my grandfather took a taste forcing him into a similar situation. As it turned out, the infamous candy was in fact, a cube of chicken bouillon and the reason why Anixagoras made such a mistake was because he was 92 years old and nearly blind.Cyprus is a rapidly changing country shifting from a dominant rural village structure to an urban cityscape. Currently, we are witnessing an exciting change which will allow everyone to get a better idea of what village life in Cyprus is like. With the aging of the last generation of village dwellers, developers are being invited to renovate homes and upgrade transportation systems to create the authentic village experience for all. Hopefully, within the next ten to fifteen years, Cyprus will be the place to be when you want to sit down at a pleasant coffee shop, play a game of backgammon, and relax the day away.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,Germany,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/before-berlin/,"10 Crucial Things to Know Before Going to Berlin, Germany",Germany,"If you are an experienced traveler, you probably know by now that traveling to a large city should never happen without proper planning. Berlin is a city which has a lot to offer to its visitors and there are quite a few things you should know about this city which will help you experience it better.If it’s your first time traveling to Berlin, there are a few tips and tricks which can truly help you move around the city with more ease and help you feel a little less lost. Here are some crucial things you need to know in order to make your trip a lot more enjoyable.1. Visiting during the summerAs you might have imagined, the weather in Germany can be quite gloomy during the colder months. This is a huge reason why most visitors suggest that you visit Berlin during the spring or summer. Not only will you be able to visit everything without having to worry about the rain or snow, but you will also be able to carry less heavy luggage with you.2. Use public transportationFrom the moment you arrive in Berlin, you will notice that public transportation is not only affordable but also always on time. Everything in this city arrives on time and you will be able to reach every place you wish by taking the right bus or train.There are many different tickets to choose from depending on where you wish to go. The train ticket from the airport costs €3 and will help you reach the central train station in just under 30 minutes. Apart from that, you can purchase tickets for the Airport Express Buses which come every 10 minutes and cost €2.80.3. Validate your tickets on timeAfter you purchase your public transportation tickets you will have to make sure that you validate them before you enter the means of transport. There is no way to validate your ticket inside the vehicles, apart from the buses, and you don’t want to risk getting a fine over a silly mistake.If you decide to purchase a day pass ticket, it will cost you 7€ and the good thing about it is that you will only have to validate it the first time you use it. If you’re having any trouble understanding where to go because of the language barrier, The Word Point offers you translation help no matter where you are.4. Book your Reichstag building ticket in advanceOne of the things that most people want to visit when they arrive in Berlin is the Reichstag building. The glass dome is really spectacular and really worth seeing in person. In order to avoid losing time and not managing to visit it, you should book a ticket in advance. Admission is free but it’s best to reserve your spot in time, rather than waste time trying to find an open spot.5. Berlin is vegan and vegetarian-friendlyWhile Germany is well-known for its sausages, you should also know that Berlin was voted the most vegan-friendly country of 2017 by Happy Cow. With over 470 restaurants with vegan options available, you can imagine why it can be a true heaven for vegans. On top of that, Berlin also is home to the largest vegan grocery chain called Veganz.6. Cyclists are everywhereIn case you didn’t know, Berlin is one of those cities which are really friendly for cyclists. The roads are divided into two sections so that both pedestrians and cyclists can move freely in their lanes. If you’re visiting Berlin for the first time, you might just want to stay off the bike lane as it will not only be impolite but also confusing for the rest of the pedestrians and bikers.7. How tipping worksTipping in Berlin is probably as important as in any other part of the world. While it’s not always necessary, it is certainly polite and you will have to tip people correctly in order to be respectful. What is usually expected is to tip a person about 10-15% of what your total is.You will have to tell the person what you are tipping them and then pay them the total amount along with their tip. You should also not forget to tip your taxi driver as well as the porter and housekeepers in your hotel. 8. Get a museum passA great way to visit many of the museums in Berlin is to get a 3-day museum pass. In case you didn’t know, Berlin has over 170 museums, and while it’s not realistic to expect to visit each and every one of them, you should still make some time to visit the most important ones.The 3-day museum pass will cost you €29 and will provide you with free admission to over 30 museums for the course of 3 days. If you decide to do this, you should plan in advance in order to have enough time to dedicate to visiting most museums on this list. 9. Don’t focus solely on the local cuisineWhile you might be waiting to try local sausages and currywurst, you should also keep in mind that Berlin has a large Turkish population that has filled the city with countless doner kebab stands. Along with that, there are many popular Thai and Vietnamese restaurants where you can enjoy traditional recipes from the other side of the world.10. Don’t talk about World War IIImagine living in Germany where you always have to always explain the actions of your ancestors. World War II was a dark period for the entirety of Europe and the German citizens have truly grown tired of having to explain the reasons and circumstances around it. It would be best if you don’t burden anyone with this topic or if it comes up, approach it carelessly.Enjoying your time in this beautiful cityWhile there are many things to do and see, you will come to realize that Berlin is one of the most well-organized and historically rich cities in Europe. You will definitely not run out of things to see but you will need to plan everything in advance in order to manage to do everything you wish.As long as you are respectful of their culture and are in the mood to see new things, you are bound to have a great time. If you are a lover of history, art, and good food, Berlin will truly be a great choice for your next travels.For more on Berlin also check out 5 reasons to visit Berlin.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/wine-river-rhine-river-cruise-amawaterways/,Rhine River Wine Cruise on AMAWaterways in Germany,Germany," Rhine river castle and vineyard Passionate about wines, this was just the right river cruise.  And I learned, it’s not about red or white wines and how to pair with food, it’s drinking what you like.  That’s a refreshing concept.I boarded the AMAWaterways ship in Basel, Switzerland on a chilly November afternoon but once I stepped on board, the chill was chased away by the friendly reception I was given. A welcoming glass of champagne reinforced my pre-travel thoughts, a cruise about wines will be fun. Passengers continued to stream in and settled into chairs and couches in the lounge. I soon realized this homey area was the meeting spot for friends and family with casual conversations flowing as much as the wine.Riquewihr villageA talkative group of about 20 people gathered together near the back and rearranged the furniture to be in communication with each other.  They were members of a California wine club and the owner and winemaker were on board, too.  Curious, I asked our cruise director why a California wine company is on a European wine cruise.  After all, this region of the Rhine is known for excellent wines.  He explained that some wine-themed cruises host a winery from the US to lead discussions about wines and engage the passengers in wine talk.  Wine lovers book the cruises to explore old-world vineyards while swirling and sipping varietals passing by the castles on the Rhine.Oak Farm Vineyards from Lodi, California was the host winery and Dan Panella, the owner, and his winemaker Chad Joseph were ready for the week ahead of grape and fermentation talk.  And wine club member, Rick, was very ready too.  His thirst for wine could not be hidden.  I had to ask him, why European wines and why Lodi, I mean, where is Lodi?  Rick let me know the Wine Spectator named Lodi Wine Region of the Year in 2015.  Cruising the Rhine was sure to be enlightening, if not entertaining.Vineyards in the AlsaceOnce embarked, we headed for the Alsace wine region in southern France and very near Germany.  It is the capital for white wines, especially Rieslings and Gewürztraminers.  Driving through the region, the hillside became noticeably landscaped with perfect rows of vineyards. I could only imagine how many generations of families planted and harvested these grapes through good and bad times.Past the last curve in the road, colorful medieval style homes and small businesses decorated the village of Riquewihr.  Wrapped around cobblestone streets, which dipped into the village, surely this is what postcards are made of. The area has been influenced by France and Germany since both countries ruled at different times over the centuries.  German-sounding names and French macaroon stores dotted the main street.Alsace winery Dopff Au Moulin, has been family owned since 1574, and produces different varieties of white wines.  A tradition began during the second German Empire (1871-1918), of eating locally made Kugelhopf cake while drinking Gewürztraminer wine.  Still to this day, when attending a special event, a welcoming gesture is to offer a glass of wine and a slice of cake. And that’s exactly what we did in this tasting room. Interestingly, the cake, resembling a bundt cake, is not too sweet and pairs well with the sweet wine.Dopff Au Moulin wineryI asked if the cake was made on-premises and he whispered, up the street is the bakery.  My nose found the bakery and cakes were in the oven and finished baking as I stood watching.  With or without wine, the aroma was intoxicating to me.  The baker carefully handled the hot cake pans and finished each one with a dusting of powdered sugar.Kugelhopf cakes in Alsace regionSurely, it wouldn’t be France without macaroons and the bakery’s window display of the little colorful round cookies, stacked in the shape of a Christmas tree was eye-catching.  Add the sound of the cork popping from local bubbly Brut and my paradise was found.As all good things come to an end, our Captain’s farewell dinner featured AMA’s Chaine des Rotisseurs menu. The ship is a member of this prestigious culinary society and thoughtfully paired Oak Farms Wine with each course.  I particularly enjoyed the Foie Gras and walnut brioche with California’s Albarino wine. Mr. Joseph explained high acid content in the wine cuts the high fat content of the foie gras.Colorful Macaroons at Maison Alsacienne de BiscuiterieProven once again, be it old world or new world wines, the simple things in life are the best. Good food and wine shared with family and friends is the ultimate pairing.When I returned home, I pulled out my German bundt cake pan and chilled a bottle of French white wine.  My arriving guests would be welcomed in a new way now.This recipe for Alsace Kugelhopf cake is compliments of AMAWaterwaysALSACE GUGELHUPF (BUNDT CAKES)INGREDIENTS5 oz. golden raisins1.5 oz. candied orange peel pre-soaked in rum2 cups flour2.5 oz. sugar3/4 stick butter2 tsp. salt3 eggs1 tsp. vanilla or lemon extract1 cup whole milk1 oz. yeastPREPARATION METHODPlace all ingredients, except for the orange peel and raisins, into a mixing bowl and stir until the texture is smooth. Add the fruit to the dough. Let the dough rest for at least 15-20 minutes so it can rise. Divide the dough in two, and place into two well-buttered Bundt pans. Let the dough rest at room temperature for an hour. Bake in a preheated 375 degree Fahrenheit oven for 35 minutes. Makes two Bundt cakes.Disclaimer – I was a guest of AMAWaterways, however, my opinions are my own.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/driving-in-germany/,Driving in Germany as a Tourist – 13 Things to Know,Germany,"Here are 13 tips about driving in Germany that I learned or re-learned on my recent road trip through Luther Land and the Heart of Germany.1. What side of the road does Germany drive on?Germany, like the rest of continental Europe, drives on the right-hand side. In Europe, only the British Isles and Gibraltar drive on the left-hand side.2. German Road SignsBecause not everyone in the world speaks German, Germany, like most of Europe, relies heavily on international road signs.  Many of these will be obvious to visitors but here are some that might trip you up if you don’t know them. The first time we drove in Europe it took us most of a day to figure out why they kept telling us “no sawhorses”. What they were really telling us was that we were coming to the end of a limited-access highway (End Freeway).For a more exhaustive list to traffic signs check out Brian’s German Traffic Signs & Signals.3. Timed ParkingThe last of the road signs above is a critical one to know to avoid a parking ticket. A sign with a P on it is used to indicate parking, but some of these have this dial sort of indicator above it. With your rental car, you will receive a parking disk which is a blue sign with a movable white dial on it with times. When you park in an area marked with the parking disk it will indicate how long you can park. Before you leave your car you pull out your parking disk, set it to your arrival time and place it on the dashboard of your car.4. Speed LimitsThe Autobahn is Germany’s great freeway system. Yes, what you heard is correct, many of the sections (but not all) of the Autobahn have no posted speed limit. The law does say:Any person driving a vehicle may only drive so fast that the car is under control. Speeds must be adapted to the road, traffic, visibility and weather conditions as well as the personal skills and characteristics of the vehicle and load.So you can get a speeding ticket on the Autobahn if you are driving too fast.Off the Autobahn the default speed limit is 50 km/h (31 mph) in cities and 100 km/h (62 mph) in rural areas.5. The Left Lane is for PassingYou have probably heard how fast cars drive on the Germany Autobahn. That sounds great to some drivers and intimidating to others, but the fact is that German drivers are really pretty good and you should not be intimidated about driving in Germany. But you do need to know that the left lane of the highway is for passing. Don’t plan on just staying in that lane because there is always some driver who wants to pass you like ein Fledermaus out of Hell. This also means when you check your mirror to see if it is clear in that lane it is a good idea to check twice as you may underestimate how fast that car is coming.6. Flash to PassIf you forget the rule above don’t be surprised if the car behind you flashes their car’s high beams at you briefly. This is the signal that they want you to pull into the right lane so that they can pass you.7. Slow Means SlowIronically, while Germans drive faster on the highway they sometimes drive slower in town. Many urban areas, like school zones, are marks as 30 kph or 18 mph. Personally, I am amazed a car can drive that slow and they really mean to drive that slow. There is probably a speeding ticket in the mail to me as I write this because I triggered a traffic camera by driving around 25 mph through one of those zones.8. Standard is StandardAs with the rest of Europe, when you rent a car you should assume it will come with a stick-shift “standard” transmission. If you don’t know how to drive stick you can reserve an automatic but you will have to pay more for these more scare cars. 9. NavigationGerman highways are not hard to navigate but the tiny country roads can provide a challenge at times. I was also traveling in Summer which is road construction season and 3 different times in the middle of a city or small town I came to a road closed signs because of construction. Whoever put up the sign was not anticipating tourists because there was no other information, no detour, no helpful advice.So you will need navigation help. I unlocked my iPhone so I could get a German data plan by buying a SIM card for my phone. A German data plan costs about 10 euros, lasts a month but only has .5 Gb of data so use it wisely. Even with a data plan, I kept my phone in airplane mode for most of my trip and used the maps.me app to download maps of my route while I was on wi-fi. Maps.me worked to navigate most of the time. When it got confused once or twice, I turned on my phone and used Apple maps or Google maps instead.My next trip will be even easier as my T-Mobile plan will already work in Germany with no additional charges.10. Parking garagesI have a fear of German parking garages. A few years back I was driving with my then manager’s manager in a VW bus in a German parking garage and nearly took out the side of the van making one of the impossibly tight turns. The next day he was driving and had less luck as he caved-in the left side of the bus in a different parking garage in a different city. I was the one who got to check in the rental car.On my last trip, I found myself again making a 20 point turn in yet another parking garage. Fortunately this time my rental car had a backup camera and sonar to tell me when I was too close. I highly recommend getting a car with these features and I recommend caution whenever you are driving in old downtowns or too small parking garages. Take your time. Filling out insurance forms will not add to the enjoyment of your trip.11. Do I need an International Driver’s Permit for Germany?The first time I drove in Europe I took the time to get an international driver’s permit, but I have never found that I have needed one. These days I just bring my California Driver’s License and that always works for me for renting a car, including in Germany. You will need to be 18 to drive in Germany with a foreign driver’s license.12. Drinking and DrivingWhile the German’s are fond of their beer and their driving, they are even less fond of mixing the two than Americans. In the USA< a 0.08% blood alcohol level is considered under the influence. In Germany,  0.03% in conjunction with any other traffic offense or accident; 0.05% without evidence of alcoholic impact is considered under the influence.  So go ahead and have a beer, but only if someone else is driving.13. DieselGas prices in Europe are more expensive than in the USA, sometimes 2-3x higher. For this reason, many cars in Europe use diesel for better mileage. Diesel is readily available at all gas stations.ConclusionDriving in Germany is a great way to see the country. As long as you are prepared, it should be an enjoyable experience.

https://amateurtraveler.com/13-places-to-visit-in-germany-other-than-berlin-and-munich/,13 Places to Visit in Germany other than Berlin and Münich,Germany,"I am recently returned from Germany, but from parts of Germany that don’t see as much tourism as Berlin and Munich. There are many places to see that are worth your time.Roman gate in TrierTrierDid you know you can find Roman ruins in Germany? Starting in the west and heading to the east, we first come to Trier. This was a Roman city that eventually became a significant city of the Holy Roman Empire. There are two different palaces in Trier for the Prince-Electors from that time. It may be the oldest city in Germany. Trier is on the banks of the Moselle river and can also be a great jumping-off place for visiting Luxembourg which is close by.Pfalzgrafenstein Castle in the Rhine River GorgeRhine River GorgeOne of the most beautiful parts of Germany is a specific part of the Rhine which is filled with castles called the Rhine River Gorge. If you are a fan of castles then this is a place to see. The best way to see it is from a boat but easy Rhine River day trips are available from Frankfurt.Heidelberg Castle RuinsHeidelbergKnown for its university, the city is watched over by the ruins of what used to be one of the largest fortified castles in Europe. The young prince Frederick V built gardens around the castle for his young bride Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James I of England and VI of Scotland. The gardens were considered by some to be the 8th wonder of the world. But Frederick V accepted the role as the king of Bavaria (he only served briefly, he is called the Winter King) and he managed to trigger the 30 years war which left his political future and castle in ruins.On a rainy day in Heidelberg, Germany there is no one hanging out at the sidewalk cafe in the foreground. But even on a rainy day, Heidelberg is a beautiful city. You can see the old bridge in the distance.FüssenIf the castle of “Mad” Ludwig, Neuschwanstein, looks familiar it might be because it has graced travel posters for Germany for many years or because Disney borrowed from its design for the castle in Disneyland. The castle was built long after the age of castles in the 1800s and is a monument for romanticism and conspicuous consumption. Ludwig, a strong swimmer, later drowned during his morning swim under suspicious circumstances.Rothenburg ob der Tauber, GermanyRothenburg ob der TauberOne of the few walled cities left in Germany, Rothenberg looks like the place where Geppetto would live. It is very touristy, so stay overnight so that you see the town without the crowds from tour buses. Take the night watchman’s tour, walk the old walls, climb the tower of City Hall and try a snowball (sneeballen) pastry.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-84121-10-20-2007.mp4DüsseldorfOften rated as one of the livable cities in the world, Düsseldorf also knows how to party. Not only is one of its streets known as the “longest bar in the world” but it also hosts one of the largest carnival celebrations. It is like a mix of Mardi Gras and Halloween, which culminates with a parade that draws more than a million spectators. Architecture fans should not miss some of the modern buildings by architect Frank Geary near the Düsseldorf’s Rhine Tower (Rheinturm).Cologne / KolnThe 4th largest city in Germany is located on the Rhine and is best known for its cathedral. Climb to the top of the tower in the cathedral for a breathtaking view of the city. Note that a friend of ours who is claustrophobic found that he had to turn back from the narrow winding staircase.Bellevue Palace at KasselKasselIf you think that it’s cool to have a fountain in your garden then you might enjoy the spectacular display of manmade cascades, foundations, and streams at the Bellevue Palace in Kassel. In the summer the fountain displays happen in the afternoon around 2 pm but check the schedule.Hainich National ParkHainich National ParkIf you thought that canopy walks were limited to Costa Rican rainforests then you have not visited Hainich National Park. Get up high in and over a deciduous forest and learn about its ecosystem. The canopy walk has rope ladders and bridges that kids of all ages will love.Wartburg CastleEisenach / Wartburg CastleVisit the home town of Johan Sebastian Bach and the museum dedicated to him that features concerts of his work several times a day. Luther also did his schooling in Eisenach and translated the New Testament to German in beautiful Wartburg castle that overlooks the town. Visit the Luther House and also a museum dedicated to Wagner. Car buffs should visit the car museum just outside of town where they manufactured cars for 100 years.Erfurt Market BridgeErfurtVisit the old Market Bridge which is covered with shops just like the old London Bridge (this one is smaller but didn’t fall down). Climb the hill above the town to the battlements of an old star fortress. Visit the monetary where Luther studied to be a monk. Unlike so many medieval towns in Germany, 90% of Erfurt survived WW2, so these are the original buildings and not restorations. It has the oldest university in Germany. You can visit the building that once housed a synagogue in the 1300s including a treasure trove of items left in the area when the Jews were expelled because they were blamed for deaths from the plague.Market Square in WeimarWeimarThis is the home of Goethe, Schiller, and List, but also the city where Hitler first came to power. It is a picturesque town with a beautiful pedestrian-only old town, but just north of town you can also find the concentration camp Buchenwald. Ironically this makes it both the center of the German Enlightenment and of one of the darkest chapters in the history of the German people.Garden Kingdom of Dessau-WorlitzWörlitz / Garden KingdomIf you had the money and the time to build the best garden in the world, you might end up with something like the gardens between Wörlitz and nearby Dessau. 7 different large gardens fill 55 square miles (142 km2). The palace in Wörlitz is also one of the original neoclassic buildings in Germany. The garden, built on the English garden model in the late 1700s, includes Greek temples, a couple of palaces, summer houses, ferries, and even a fake volcano.Wittenberg LutherstadtWittenberg LutherstadtThe reformation got its start in this picturesque town when a local pastor, Martin Luther, nailed a list of grievances to the university church door. 2017 will be the 500th anniversary of that event and the city is opening a new museum of the reformation to accompany the museums in the former homes of reformers Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon. Wittenberg holds a wonderful festival in early June which commemorates the wedding of Luther to ex-nun Katherine von Bora. The town goes all medieval for the occasion.learn more about Germany by listening to:Travel to Berlin – Episode 684Danube River Cruise – Episode 664The Liberation Route Europe (WWII) – Episode 626Travel to Baden-Württemberg in Germany – Episode 559Road Trip Through Luther Land and the Heart of Germany – Episode 519Travel to Munich Germany – Episode 469Travel to Düsseldorf, Germany – Episode 413Cruising the Rhine River – Episode 254Travel to Eastern Germany – Episode 209Travel to Bavaria and Southern Germany – Episode 188Travel to Rothenburg Germany, Zurich and Interlaken Switzerland – Episode 100Travel to Berlin, Germany – Episode 40Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/24-hours-berlin-germany/,"24 Hours in Berlin, Germany",Germany,"At the beginning of a press trip that I am I this week in Germany I had 24 hours to enjoy Berlin. 24 hours was just long enough to see some of my favorite sites again and to join a walking tour through Context Travel to get a deeper look at one of Berlin’s most interesting neighborhoods.Brandenburg Gate AreaMy first trip to Berlin was shortly after the wall fell so the area around the iconic Brandenburg Gate is still special to someone like me who grew up when Berlin was a divided city. I did not get any unobstructed pictures of the gate on this trip as they were preparing for some big event. What was once a place of division is now apparently the perfect place for a party.Right next to the gate is also the Remodeled Reichstag building with its beautifully clear dome that lets visitors look down on the German lawmakers with a transparency that is both literal and symbolic.The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe is close by the Brandenburg Gate as well. This evocative memorial deserves a visit, even a quick one. Museum IslandOn our last trip to Berlin, we ended a walking tour on Berlin’s famous Museum Island, but by the time we got there all the museums had closed so I planned my day to arrive when the museums opened at 10:00 am. At the top of my list was a visit to the Pergamon Museum.Even though I could not visit the namesake Pergamon Alter because of renovations, the museum has 2 other “wow” exhibits. The first of these is the Ishtar Gate from the ancient city of Babylon. The museum recreates the gate and the entrance street and gives you the sort of humbling “here lives the great King of Babylon” moment that the builders originally intended.The back of the gate of Ishtar is not the city of Babylon but another impressive gateway from the ancient market of the Roman city of Miletus.I also visited the New Museum to see, among other things, the bust of Queen Nefertiti of Egypt. The many archeological treasures on Museum Island are a tribute to the work of German archeologists who helped create modern archeology.KreuzbergThe second half of my day was highlighted by a walking tour of the neighborhood of Kreuzberg called “Everyday Life in Kreuzberg”. My tour was with and provided by (paid for) Context Travel. I had reached out to Context as a way to do a deeper dive than most tours provide. They have tours provided by experts, like an architecture tour being given by an architect or an archeology tour led by an archeologist. This particular tour was led by Chris Benedict who is not only a long time resident of the neighborhood but one who had worked for sometime for the local neighborhood improvement project.Kreuzberg is an old working class neighborhood which sat up against the wall in the divided Berlin. It has always had many immigrants, formerly Jewish but now more Turkish. It has the most mosques, the highest unemployment and poorest schools of Berlin neighborhoods but also has a thriving art scene and is a center for nightlife. It is both a bit sketchy and a little bit trendy. It’s Facebook relationship status with the rest of Berlin would be “it’s complicated”.We started the tour at an “underground” station which in Kreuzberg is not underground. I was handed a flyer for cannabis and walked past a few youths that seemed to be running some sort of racket before I even left the station. I never felt unsafe, even walking down allies but might have felt different at night.From the street it is not obvious that behind some of the ornate facades were originally more houses for workers as well as small factories. Knowing which alley to duck down is part of the fun of exploring the neighborhood. We visited one of the many blocks where squatters took over buildings it he 1990s when the official plan for Kreuzberg called for tearing it down and replacing it with apartment complexes like the crumbling ones that surround the U bahn station of Kottbusser Tor. Much of the character of the Kreuzberg neighborhood would have been lost without some civil disobedience.But we also visited sites where the nearly annual May Day protests would pit locals vs the police. Even now when May Day is more about celebrating and less about rioting, the neighborhood resists changes. Chris said that when she was working with the community improvement project, some residence would vandalize anything that looked like gentrification out of the fear that it would drive out the poorer mostly immigrant population.We visited a weekly market, saw people floating on one of the canals, walked by sidewalk cafes, but also walked past ever present graffiti, most of it not the artistic kind. Kreuzberg has a former hospital turned into an art center and a tiny house built on what somehow was unclaimed land near where the wall used to be. It has some lovely art deco buildings and some that would have been considered dreary even if they had been built on the GDR side of the wall.Kreuzberg is a neighborhood in transition, despite itself. It is, to some degree, some of the immigration issues in Germany in miniature. It is dynamic. It is frustrating. It is an interesting neighborhood to explore if you find yourself in Berlin.My thanks to Visit Berlin who put me up in the wonderful and wonderfully convenient Amano Grand Central (check prices) (see reviews) which is across the street from the main train station, to Context Travel for offering this tour, and to airberlin who flew me to get to Berlin.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/connecting-cold-war-berlin-25-years-fall-berlin-wall/,Remembering the Cold War in Berlin,Germany,"My Piece of the Berlin WallI was on a plane when the news broke. This was in the day before cell phones and ubiquitous Internet. Imagine my surprise when my wife picked me up from the airport. I asked her what’s new and she told me the Berlin Wall has fallen.To put this in context, you have to remember that the Berlin wall was built in the year after I was born and didn’t come down until the year my daughter was born. It was a constant. It was a known quantity. We found ourselves glued to the TV that evening as we watched incredulously people dancing on the iconic image of of the Cold War.I was able to travel to Berlin for the first time just over a year after the Wall fell. On that trip I could find no trace of the Wall, but the city was still obviously West Berlin and East Berlin. East Berlin was still drab and colorless and in some places pockmarked with bullet holes from World War II. Russian soldiers were still stationed in eastern Germany as this was in the days before reunification. It may have been my imagination or the rewriting of time but it was my impression when I saw some of these soldiers in my travels that they looked a bit dazed and out of place.The city is now quite different from the one that I first visited. East Berlin is now in many ways the more trendy and happening part of the city. But if you look for it there are still places to connect with the history of the Cold War in Berlin if you have a bit of Ostalgie (Ostalgie is a German term referring to nostalgia for aspects of life in East or “Ost” Germany).Checkpoint CharlieThe famous gateway between the American sector of West Berlin and East Berlin was Checkpoint Charlie. Many a tense moment happened at this spot as tourists or spies traversed from one part of the city to the other beneath the watchful eyes of armed guards. It was also the spot for numerous escapes from East Germany. The original checkpoint was taken down shortly after the Wall, the current guard house is a recreation. It has two large portraits of border guards, a U.S. Soldier facing East and a East German Soldier facing West. The original guardhouse can be found in the Museum of the Western Allies in Berlin.The Checkpoint Charlie Museum commemorates the courage and ingenuity of those who risked their lives (or lost them) trying to flee to the West. The museum is one of the most poorly organized museums I have ever been to but is still oddly wonderful. The museum was started near the American checkpoint  before the fall of the wall and documents escape attempts from that day on August 13th 1961 when the city woke up to find itself divided. Escape attempts include people who tunneled under the wall, hid themselves in secret compartments in cars and even occasionally flew over the wall.DDR MuseumOn the Spree opposite Berlin cathedral is a museum dedicated to every day life in the DDR (East Germany). The DDR Museum was founded in 2006 and has welcomed more than 6 million visitors since then who are curious about what life was like behind the Wall: “Coming of age and going to school; full employment and queuing for food; Stasi surveillance and the Berlin Wall”. Perhaps the most curious display is a living room with the “original GDR smell”.East Side GalleryThe largest section of the Berlin Wall that is still standing (but is threatened by new development) is the East Side Gallery. Artists have painted this section of the wall with murals about freedom. 105 artists from all over the world painted these in 1990.Berlin Airlift MonumentJust outside the Tempelhof International Airport you can find a monument to the Berlin Airlift. One of the first crises of the Cold War was when the U.S.S.R cut off all access to Berlin from 24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949 in the Berlin Blockade. The Allies responded by flying supplies into the city in what became known as the Berlin Airlift. In total the USA delivered 1,783,573 tons and the RAF 541,937 tons, totaling 2,326,406 tons, nearly two-thirds of which was coal, on 278,228 flights to Berlin. The Brandenburg GateIt is the place where U.S. Presidents John Kennedy declared himself a Berliner (meaning a resident of the city, not the well-known pastry) and Ronald Reagan called for President Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall”. The gate is just outside the old parliament building with its new clear dome where you can look down on German laws being created. You can also find a great 3 hour “free” walking tour of the city that starts near by.The Berlin Wall Memorial and Documentation CentreA section of the wall and one of the guard towers can be seen at The Berlin Wall Memorial and Documentation Centre. A visitor center here explains the history of the Wall. A memorial here commemorates those who died trying to escape from East Germany.Berlin Spy MuseumThe Berlin Spy Museum opened in 2014 in a city that was once teeming with spies. This museum (all 21,500 square feet of it) focuses on agents, double agents, spy craft and espionage. It focuses on the spy business both from World War II and the Cold War.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/smiles-carnival-dusseldorf-germany/,"The Smiles of Carnival in Düsseldorf, Germany",Germany,"I had a very unusual vantage point for viewing the big Carnival parade in Dusseldorf, Germany earlier this month. In stead of joining the 1-2 million people lining the parade route I watched from on the Die Mode and Shoppingstadt Düsseldorf float, waving at the crowds for hours with a big “helau!” and throwing candy and goodies.This week’s Amateur Traveler episode will retell the tail but I wanted to show you what the parade looked like from my vantage point. The memory that will last much longer than the sore arm are the smiles of the people who stood and watched this parade for hours. Even at the end of the parade route when we had long since run out of free things to throw to the crowd, we were still greeted with some great smiles.see all my pictures from Carnival in DüsseldorfThanks to both Dusseldorf and AirBerlin who paid my way.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/checkpoint-charlie-berlin-wall/,"Checkpoint Charlie, Looking in Different Directions – Berlin, Germany",Germany,"Checkpoint Charlie and Soviet soldier pictureA machine gun turret was over my shoulder, yet I tried to remain calm as the East German and Soviet police made me sign a confession.  It was 1976 and the Berlin wall was as solid as the American dollar back then.  Not knowing it was illegal to bring more than the allotted East Marks into the country, my honesty pulled me from passport control and stern looking officers began questioning how I obtained the money and took possession of my passport.  I instantly knew I was at their mercy and screaming about my civil rights would do no good in an area controlled by strong Soviet influence.   The only other border crossing I had experienced was in Tijuana, Mexico, but this encounter took personal liberties to a new level.I glanced behind me at Checkpoint Charlie, in the American sector of West Berlin, which was only a short distance away, however, a calculated long distance back to the freedoms I knew.  People routinely died trying to escape from the east to the west and now I could understand the black and white choices.Thirty minutes later, which seemed like an eternity, an officer presented a typed form in large bold print explaining my admission of guilt and confiscation of the money.  If I sign, do I get to proceed or will this land me in jail begging the embassy to release me.  I was able to pass through doors with a stark lesson about a police state.Recently, I stood at Checkpoint Charlie and hardly recognized the former border crossing area. Cars, buses and people riding bikes zipped by as if it has always been open.  Wall remnants have been saved as a reminder and are decorated by international artists looking more whimsical than when previously topped with threatening curled barb wire.The Checkpoint Charlie guard shack had become a tourist attraction with people smiling as they had their picture taken on this historical landmark.  Souvenir shops lined both sides of the street with different languages being spoken in and around.  To delineate from the two different sides, the famous pictures of a US Army soldier and a Soviet soldier still stand tall with their youngish faces facing their assigned area.US Army soldier still stands at old border crossingI had trouble visualizing where the machine gun towers once stood, and there was no evidence of the passport control office.  Grey dismal buildings full of shrapnel had been demolished and modern architectural designs stood in their place.  Using a map to orient my bearings, red lines outlined where the wall had been throughout Berlin.  Unbeknownst to me, I was staying and dining in the old East Berlin, unrecognizable from years of progressive reunifications and rebuilding.Berlin wall decorated by artistTalking with two East German men who lived behind the wall during the era of the construction proved insightful.  One of the men, now 80 years old and living in the United States, fled and left his properties as he realized the seriousness of the Soviet encroachment.  The other man, his grammar school friend since first grade, stayed in the outskirts of Berlin and through the years of occupation, routinely got into any long lines hoping to get some food for his family. When his aunt who lived on the west side had an important birthday, he was allowed to cross over to attend the party but none of his family could go with him.His wife had been a hairdresser to important clients and they would at times bring her goods which helped them sustain their family. Today, they have been married over 50 years and are free to visit his longtime friend in the USA.  When I met him he dressed in western wear and I assumed he had a ranch.  No, he likes the cowboy looking apparel in the USA and buys lots of it when he visits.Berlin has many well-known historical sites such as Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag Parliament building and the imposing very tall television tower.  Also important to see is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews, Soviet War Memorial and the Deutscher Dome with a spectacular view of the city.  These and more sites can be visited with an organized tour or hop off, hop on bus.  The Berlin Welcome Card offers travel guides, free public transportation, entry to museums, and discounts for shopping, concerts, biking and many other ways to see the old and new city.  Information for the different passes can be found at www.visitberlin.de.Modernized and open streets in former occupied East BerlinPlanning a trip to Berlin could also coincide with the 25th anniversary of the fall of the wall with remembrances planned for November 9, 2014.  One thousand white balloons will be strung along a temporary wall to light it up and shine into the sky.   Facebook/visitBerlin has current information about the remembrance events.Berlin is now a vibrant city and its past is still part of its future.www.VisitBerlin.deFacebook/VisitBerlinShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-beer-in-germany/,All You Need to Know about Beer in Germany,Germany,"Oktoberfest, the world’s third largest beer consumption per capita, and even a beer law – as you would have guessed, beer is a vital component of German culture. So if you’re planning a trip to Germany, be sure to sample some of the local beers, and enjoy some of the traditions around beer!Some beer facts to get you started:Germany’s beer consumption per capita is the third largest in the world, after the Czech Republic and Ireland. So on average, every German drinks 110 litres of beer every year! The US is back in 13th place with a modest 81 litres.Some 1300 breweries in Germany are producing over 5000 brands of beer, with over half of the breweries located in the southern German state of Bavaria.The alcohol content of German beers is usually between 4.7% and 5.4% for most traditional brews, while the alcohol content of Bockbier or Doppelbock (double Bockbier) can rise up to16%, which is stronger than many wines.The Oktoberfest, held in Munich every year from late September to the first weekend in October, is the world’s largest beer festival. Only beer brewed within the city limits of Munich (Oktoberfest Beer) is allowed to be served. Around 7-8 million litres are consumed each year during the 16 day festival.The German Beer Purity Law (Reinheitsgebot)There are a lot of laws in Germany, so it might not come as a surprise that there is one about beer as well. The German Beer Purity Law or Reinheitsgebot is the world’s oldest food safety law that is still valid. It regulates the ingredients and was introduced in Bavaria in 1516. The Beer Purity Law stipulates that only barley, hops, and water may be used for beer brewing – yeast had not yet been discovered. It later became the fourth legal ingredient.In modern times, the law is part of the German tax code and states that, in bottom-fermented beers (lagers), only barley malt, hops, yeast and water may be used. Lagers brewed in Germany may not contain: spices, corn, rice, sugar, un-malted grains, chemical additives and stabilizers. The original law, which also included that beer not brewed according to the Purity Law could not be sold in Germany, was abolished in 1987 when the European Court ruled that its narrow list of ingredients was a restraint of free trade.Since the ruling, it has been legal to import beers into Germany that are brewed with adjuncts (sugar, corn, rice, non-malted grains) and treated with chemicals for an artificial head and a longer shelf life. German brewers, however, still adhere fiercely to the Reinheitsgebot as a matter of pride and tradition. When Beck’s Brewery, one of Germany’s five largest breweries, was sold to Belgium-based Interbrew (now Anheuser Busch In-Bev, the world’s largest brewery by volume) there were fears that the traditional Beck’s beer would be “contaminated” with non-Purity Law conforming ingredients. However, the recipe for Beck’s beer has remained unchanged, and it continues to be Germany’s top selling export beer.Types of German beerThere is a large selection of beers in Germany, many of which are locally brewed and often not available outside the area. If you know what type of beer you prefer, this gives you a good starting point:You almost can’t go wrong with ordering a Pils /Pilsener or a Hefeweizen .  Pils is a light lager with a more prominent hop taste, while Hefeweizen is an unfiltered wheat beer with a yeast base.Weizenbier and Weissbier (mostly spelled Weißbier) are the standard names for wheat beer. You can just order one of those and will most likely be presented with the local variety. The very light Berliner Weisse is often mixed with either raspberry or woodruff syrup (“Berliner Weisse mit Schuss”) and makes a great summer drink.Some other popular lager beer types are Export (Dortmund region), Helles (Bavaria), Bock (an amber-bodied, slightly bitter lager) as well as Kölsch (Cologne region) and Alt (Düsseldorf region). Don’t confuse the latter two! The near-neighbouring cities of Cologne (Köln in German) and Düsseldorf are in a long-standing more-hate-than-love relationship, and you don’t want to ruffle any feathers by ordering the wrong beer in the wrong town…The lovers of darker beers have the choice between Schwarzbier (fermented dark lager with a roasty taste), Dunkles (similar with the more sweet Munich variety and the more hoppy Franconian version, both Bavaria) or Rauchbier, a speciality of the Bavarian town of Bamberg. Furthermore there is Kellerbier (cellar beer), unfiltered lagers similar to cask ales.Mixing drinks – beer basedWhile Germans prefer their beer itself to be brewed to highest purity standards, there is a long tradition of mixing the finished product. The most popular, Radler, is a Shandy with about 50% beer (any) and 50% German style sparkling lemon soda. It is known for being thirst-quenching and most popular in summer, but you can get it all year round – even pre-mixed in bottles or cans. Another popular beer mix drink beer and coke (“Diesel”), plus there are numerous other variations.German beer brandsThe largest: Krombacher (most consumed Pils in Germany, Krombacher Pils), Bitburger (also Pils), Warsteiner (product range: Hefeweizen, Pils, dark lager, alcohol free), Beck’s (large product range).Ordering your German beerNow you’re ready to talk the talk. To begin, it will behoove you to learn German phrases commonly heard in a German pub.“Bitte ein Pils” or “Ein Pils, bitte” – A Pils please – likely to get you a decent beer in most places. Replace Pils with the beer of your choice.“Ich hätte gerne ein Bier” – I would like to have a beer“Ein alkoholfreies Bier, bitte” – ordering alcohol free beer, available almost anywhereWhen you raise your glass, you say “Prost”, or, mostly in Bavaria, “Zum Wohl” – and don’t forget to clink your glasses together, this is called “anstoßen”.Enjoy your beer!Sibylle Bernardakis (but not the Amateur Traveler) was sponsored to write this post by Pimsleur which provides resources to learn German and 50+ other languages.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/christmas-market-on-the-danube-passau-germany/,"Christmas Market on the Danube – Passau, Germany",Germany,"Cruising the DanubeI rounded the corner on the snow plowed cobblestone streets and my fellow passenger carefully chose her steps heading towards a centuries old building. She knew the route and while her heavy scarf blew in the wind she smiled with anticipation of what was ahead in the Christmas Markets in Europe. She had been here before but it was my first time and she talked about buying glass ornaments and grilled sausages with her sights set on the old town square. Our small river cruise ship had docked close to town which was helpful because she planned to return to the ship and drop off purchases throughout the evening.Wearing layers of wool clothing and heavy gloves, I walked the streets to the old village of Passau, Germany. I watched snowflakes land on my hands as I hurried up the cobblestone walkway and in between Bavarian shops. Gothic style organ music drew me into St. Stephan’s Cathedral and looking like a scene from a movie I entered through the massive doors to hear a concert played on the largest cathedral organ in the world. I had arrived to a magical atmosphere of this Christmas Market which I was about to explore with my anxious friend.I watched women with baby strollers and locals dressed in long winter coats and big fur hats sharing the news of the day with festive merriment in the town center. Colorful lights dressed up the wooden stalls during the normally dark winter time and it appeared no one was in a hurry to leave. My friend pointed out the ceramic mugs lined up in the stalls to drink from the large vats of Gluehwein, the traditional hot mulled red wine with aromatic spices to warm the body and wash down the traditional juicy sausages. The smell of grilled meats lead me to see two fellow shipmates sharing a 2 foot long sausage chomping at each end and winding up in the middle with mustard smeared around their contented faces.Lebkuchen, a gingerbread cookie baked on top a thin oblaten wafer is a specialty item sold during the holiday season and they are piled high on the merchant’s counter. My German friend back home will be so delighted when I bring him a big bag of these delights to dunk in his morning coffee. Other merchants welcomed us with wares of wooden holiday decorations, heavy woolen scarves and handmade toys. I tried on a red wool sweater with a black reindeer on the back and pom poms hanging from the collar and decided this would make my fashion statement back home in Southern California. I also selected gifts of woolen socks and scarves all made in Germany and toasty warm for friends across the USA.At last my friend made her way to a popped up round building with glass windows encircled with lights and a door to keep in the heat. This is where the handmade glass ornaments were sold, she excitedly told me as we entered to view hundreds of ornaments. We spent a long time casually looking at nearly every ornament watching the light reflect through the prisms of each angle and painted décor. She handed the shop keeper so many ornaments and he had to hold people at bay while he wrapped them carefully for travel. The owner was proud of his wares and with a smile, hoped she would come back next year after mentioning she had been there before.Carefully clutching bags full of gifts for friends that were neatly and securely wrapped for my trip home, we strolled back to the ship following the path which led us into the markets. Once on the ship the crew had hot Gluehwein to serve the cold passengers and we excitedly exchanged shopping stories.The next morning over espresso and thick coffee cake, my friend used her hands to explain the upcoming stop to Nuremberg, one of the biggest markets in Europe.Along the smooth sailing Danube River with land on each side of the 150 passenger ship, I easily walked off the ship to ports in Austria, Germany and Hungary to enjoy village Christmas Markets filled with handmade regional items. Cruising past castles and maneuvering through locks on the Danube River, our boutique style AMA Waterways cruise ship had docked once again for shopping in one of many European Christmas Markets.I got my shopping bag ready and smiled, realizing the ports were as much fun as the journey.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/berlin-hostel-or-luxury-hotel/,Berlin – Hostel or Luxury Hotel?,Germany,"My personal travel kicked off when I started work for a luxury hotel booking site. Reviewing properties in the Travel Intelligence collection is part of my job, so I’ve stayed at a fair few amazing places that I could only dream of before. I do wonder, though: has my experience of new destinations (I bounced between TI hotels in Madrid, Copenhagen and New York last year) been altered by going luxury instead of sticking to hostels? How much in general are trips affected by where we stay? On a long weekend in Berlin last month, I got to find out.My Berlin itinerary was split down the middle: for the first two nights, I’d booked myself in to a dorm at 15-EUR-per-night Ostel on the east side of the city. For the last two, I was to whizz to the centre of town for a stay at super-chic apartment hotel Lux Eleven, which was arranged in exchange for a review for my site. I was curious: would one show me a better time in Berlin than the other? Would the change in accommodation even make a difference?Well, yes and no. Both places were faultless on cleanliness, transport links and service. I liked the coffee and the opulent shower at Lux Eleven, but then I also liked the camaraderie at Ostel, where our new dorm-mates gave us lifesaving city tips (most memorably, that the pool we were planning to visit was swimwear-optional. We chickened out in the end.)The luxury option’s got to come out top, right? If not because it’s obviously my kind of thing then because, well, it’s luxury! It’s super-cosy, impossibly smart, prettier-than-your-own-home type accommodation – and above all else, you get a private room, which is already a notch ahead of hostelling. Yes, the difference in comfort is stark: at Ostel I slept in a bunk, at Lux Eleven, my comfy double faced a wall-mounted LCD TV, on which I watched MTV in bed.And yet, and yet: this, and many other Lux Eleven touches, was a lovely extra but not a Berlin essential for me.If I’d gone to Monaco or St Tropez, an all-the-trimmings kind of stay would make absolute sense – but Berlin’s different. Berlin is quite literally graffiti-and-broken-glass covered, of legendary nightlife and a grimily creative scene: clubs look like sets from Blade Runner, a walk down certain streets sees you pass squats and gaps of rubbly wasteland between buildings. I came to get a slice of this picture-perfect edginess, and it felt almost odd to go back to a plush pad after strolling the city.Of course Berlin’s also got the historic architecture, fancy bars and designer boulevards to match any other European capital, and floating hither and thither between them from a smart hotel is can be a total joy. But it’s an option, rather than a given. The alternative scene is right on the surface here – you could very easily live by the night, and save the high life for your next trip.Here’s what I think it boils down to: luxury hotels operate in their own fabulous bubbles, which is an amazing treat wherever they’re located. But with a hostel there’s no barriers – it’s as good as your own attitude towards it and the other people who are staying there. Hostelling in Berlin, you’re effectively taking the rough with the rough: but really, quite possibly, that’s how you might want it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/scandinavia-travel-for-first-timers-what-to-expect/,Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect,Denmark,"Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect?Scandinavian countries stand among the most perfect destinations for a getaway as they combine all you need for a wonderful vacation: picturesque landscapes, cutting-edge cities, outstanding cuisine and adventurous spirit. If you’ve already made up your mind to explore the motherland of Vikings for the first time, you should know a couple of facts about this marvelous region to avoid some pitfalls and make your Scandinavia travel even more pleasant and memorable.No money, no honeyThe first thing that’s impossible not to mention is that this Nordic region may astound or even shock some visitors with its, at times, skyrocketing prices. Norway, in particular, is the most expensive country in the world with average salaries of 4665 euros per month, so it’s not that hard to imagine that the prices there – and in Scandinavia on the whole – can bite. Good news: there are some ways to save money and travel around Northern Europe without breaking the bank. You can cut back on your costs by joining a pre-planned small group tour, buying multi-day transport tickets instead of single fares, saving on accommodation by choosing to stay at hostels or simply by getting food in local supermarkets instead of dining in posh restaurants. In any case, Scandinavia is not a budget destination, so it’s better to plan the trip carefully and keep an eye on your spending in order not to squander all your money during the first two days.One more fact about money is that Scandinavia is becoming more and more cashless, thus the most convenient and wise payment method is by card.Unpredictable WeatherMost people believe that Scandinavian climate tends to be cold and severe, but that’s not entirely true. Everything depends on the season and region you’re going to explore. If you’re planning a summer trip, you may be pleasantly surprised by mild and warm weather with temperatures of 21-23°С during the day in the southern regions, and by the shiny midnight sun during the night in the north. Polar day is a usual phenomenon in northern Norway and Sweden as some parts of these countries are located beyond the Arctic Circle, meaning the sun doesn’t go down the horizon in the summer months and can be seen 24 hours a day.Winters are also not that severe in the majority of Scandinavian capitals. For instance, the average winter temperatures in Oslo and Copenhagen are only about -3/-5°С due to the proximity to the Gulf Stream. However, if you want to fulfill your dream-come-true to visit the Santa Claus residence in Lapland, stock up with warm sweaters as you’ll have to travel in the frosty conditions of -15/-17°С.Unexpected Masterpieces and Hidden GemsScandinavia is not only about natural marvels like breathtaking fjords, tiny islands and frozen lakes. The region boasts fascinating cities and lovely villages that have their own special charms. Green parks of urban Helsinki, Hans Christian Andersen’s heritage in Danish Odense, the majestic Stockholm Royal Palace, numerous museums of Oslo… there’s no end to Scandinavian attractions that are worth visiting. But it’s sure that you’ll come across even more hidden gems than you expected to see. The brilliant example of Scandinavian creativity and love to beauty is the Stockholm subway. It’s considered to be the world’s longest art exhibition as 90 of the 100 stations are decorated with fantastic paintings, sculptures, and mosaics, created by more than 150 artists.Scandinavian cities also have a dense impressive collection of street art. There are even tours on the urban murals that are sometimes painted on the facades of buildings in the city centers. Some of them have deep meaning, some are painted just for fun. Anyway, Scandinavians just love to turn boring structures into real masterpieces.Scandinavian Design and Decor – MinimalismComing to Scandinavia, you can’t help but notice the free and easy spirit of the Viking descendants. The main trend of living is minimalism which pervades every aspect of everyday life: from the clothing they wear to how they decorate their homes to their attitudes toward food.The inventors of Ikea and H&M, Scandinavians do their best to simplify their lives. It’s unlikely that you’ll come across lots of people wearing sophisticated colorful clothes for the reason that Nordic people put comfort above all. They mainly give preference to basic clothes and comfortable shoes but combine them in the way to look trendy and cool.The same simplicity can be seen in Scandinavian decor. The typical interior uses light pastel colors diluted with bright accents. They also keep a strong relationship with the elements and nature. Passionate about the idea of harmony and eco-friendliness, Scandinavians employ lots of wooden items in their homes: from furniture to floors and windows.As for the way of cooking, you’ll be surprised about how delicious simple meals can be. Nordic cuisine boasts an impressive variety of dishes based on fresh organic products. So visiting this region offers a perfect opportunity to savor the taste of healthy foods prepared in the best traditions of local chefs.Cycling – Scandinavian CbsessionThe people of the European North are true nature lovers and put much effort into the protection of the environment. Traveling around the cities, you’ll witness the huge number of cyclists and that’s not a coincidence. The most ‘cycling’ Scandinavian capital is Copenhagen where you can borrow a bicycle for any period of time absolutely for free. Moreover, the citizens ride bikes in any weather conditions, even in winter. The main arguments in favor of bikes are the reduction of emissions in the atmosphere, mobility and health benefits.Scandinavians also practice a responsible approach to waste processing. For a couple of decades, citizens have been accustomed to sorting garbage: almost near every house there are containers for paper, glass, metal, plastic, food and unrecoverable waste which helps these countries to remain in the top of the most ecologically sound countries in the world.All in all, Scandinavia offers a number of attractions and features to fall in love with. No doubt that the trip to this spectacular region will leave lots of lovely memories and impressions that eventually can become the reason to come back, maybe more than once. This article is a sponsored by firebirdtours.com.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-amazing-must-see-places-2017/,6 Amazing Must See Places for 2017,Denmark,"“The gladdest moment in human life, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands.” – Sir Richard BurtonSummer is almost upon us and for many, that means thinking about our yearly vacation. The budget airline revolution and strong US dollar have made it more affordable than ever to take that dream trip. So where should you go? Whether you’re a lay on the beach type or a cultural city explorer, this list has something for everyone. Here are 7 excellent places to blow off steam in 2017:1. PortugalAlta Duoro PortugalThe oft-forgotten gem of Western Europe, Portugal has rebounded financially since the global recession. The capital, Lisbon, is in the midst of a gastronomic revolution, making the most of fabulous fresh fish and local products of the lush Mediterranean climate.Lisbon is a city of contrast, in which, the sublime black and white tilework clashes with red clay rooftops and the vibrant azure of the Rio Tejo delta.To the south, the stunning grottos of the Algarve are dotted with secretive beaches.In the North, you’ll find Porto at the mouth of the river Douro. The birthplace of Port wine and home to some the world’s best vintners. A Douro valley cruise is a must for true wine enthusiasts, and a delightful journey for all.Overall, Portugal has a ton to offer in a tiny compact (affordable) package.2. Croatian CoastCroatia Coast, photo from pixabay.comCroatia’s tourism industry is just before the fever pitch. With a little help from Game of Thrones, Westerners are finally flocking to the gem of the Adriatic. The picturesque castle of Dubrovnik (you may recognize it as King’s Landing), sits on crystal clear inlets and alcoves.Locals recommend an island hop from Korcula, to Brac, to party central Hvar, and finally to Pag, where you’ll find stellar artisanal cheese. On Pag, you’ll feel a world away from your troubles on the barren rocky surface often likened to the surface of the Moon. Nearby Zadar is famous for a majestic sunset Alfred Hitchcock once lauded as “the world’s most beautiful.” Roman ruins are ubiquitous and especially worthwhile in the Istrian city of Pula, which features one of Europe’s best preserved amphitheatres.Croatia is fully recovered from the tumultuous 90’s and ready to take you in, it’s best to take advantage before everyone else takes notice.3. DenmarkCanal boat in Copenhagen, photo from pixabay.comIn the capital, Copenhagen, you’ll find an eclectic mix of the contemporary and the classic. The architecture offers a delightful clash between the ancient sea foam rusted copper roofs and modern compositions, like the flowing Opera House. The exploding food scene, likewise, ebbs between traditional open faced sandwiches, and the truly experimental creations of nouveau culinary legends. Copenhagen is also home to Mikkeller Brewing, which constantly pumps out some outlandishly delicious craft brews.Furthermore, Denmark’s second city, Aarhus, is the European Capital of Culture for 2017. The often-ignored locale is home to Denmark’s largest university so there is no shortage of vibrant, innovative culture, and nightlife.The typically Scandinavian architecture along the quaint riverfront is, in itself enough to merit a visit. The Danes speak excellent English and are very open to explaining their unique lifestyle.4. AustraliaSydney Opera House, photo from pixabay.comAustralia is a tried and true destination. The pristine beaches, world class surf, and fantastic cities have been attracting tourists for decades. So why now? The Australian Dollar has cratered making a traditionally expensive destination affordable for the rest of the world. Furthermore, global warming and pollution continue to threaten the gargantuan Great Barrier Reef with extinction. Close to ⅔ of the reef is in danger of deadly “bleaching”, so there’s no time like the present. Budget airlines and economic trends make now the time to visit the land down under.5. CanadaBow Lake – Banff National Park, photo from pixabay.comCanada is celebrating a big birthday this year. 2017 marks the nation’s 150th year, and gives you a reason to visit the second biggest country in the world. From Vancouver in the West to Prince Edward Island in the East, Canada consistently delivers beautiful natural wonders. Alberta’s Banff National Park is well worth a visit.The cultural capital of Toronto is a cosmopolitan metropolis with a completely idyllic mixture of people from all over the planet. The contrasting Montreal is an enclave of a singular Quebecois mind-set, where you can find francophone food and a proud local heritage. Likewise, the languishing Canadian Dollar makes it a great time to join in the birthday party.6. ColombiaSalento Colombia, photo from pixabay.comBest known in the 90’s for a slew of cocaine fuelled violence, Colombia has calmed down in recent years. Growing interest in the drug kingpins, spurred by numerous documentaries and Netflix’s Narcos, has made the interior cities of Bogota, Medellin tourist attractions. It’s finally safe to visit their exquisite rolling hills.Former rival Cali, is the jewel of the pacific coast, and Cartegena is the capital of the post Columbian Caribbean. A rising star is the oldest inhabited colonial city of Santa Marta where you can see history in motion. Colombian cuisine and culture is in the midst of a velvet revolution and it could be cool to see a small part of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/visiting-kronborg-castle-denmark/,Visiting Kronborg Castle in Denmark,Denmark,"I had a recent opportunity to visit Denmark and Sweden. When looking at museums and other cultural sites, I found a Renaissance castle that looked incredible to visit. This castle’s site dates to the 1400s and King Eric VII but it was used by King Frederick later and was inhabited up until almost 1800. It protected Denmark from Sweden across the sound, only about 10 miles distant. The lines and structure are still intact and it boasts some amazing places inside its walls. Bibliophiles will also know this castle as Elsinore named from Shakespeare’s Hamlet.Side Trip from CopenhagenThe trip is two short hours from Copenhagen by train across lovely Danish fields and towns. Plan to arrive early as the gates open and the crowds can get heavy later in the day. It is a full day’s trip and you’ll want to stay for sunset as well. When you come out of the train station, you can see the castle so navigation is a breeze.The castle is surrounded by a moat and you must cross the drawbridge to get in. Once in, you see the gates that lead into a huge courtyard. At the far end of the courtyard is the chapel which actually looks more baroque and is the oldest remaining room in the castle. In 1629, a fire destroyed much of the castle and it was rebuilt. You can also enter the armory here and the start of the tour (as well as the gift shop). The tour is well worth the time; opt for the complete package which includes the dungeons.Tour of Kronborg CastleThe tour starts in the dungeons and this is amazing. The area was used to house soldiers later in history but you can tell it was a grim place. During the castle’s heyday, this was the infirmary as well. It is cold, dark and wet. Just the thing to help heal some sick soldier.The highlight of the tour is the grand ballroom which is almost 200 feet in length. It has a checkerboard floor and a huge timber ceiling. I was assured that was the fashion for the 1600s. The walls are (and were) decorated with beautiful tapestries depicting various historical events. It is filled with light and was used to entertain the visiting kings from around the world. It is truly a majestic room.After the tour, you can spend some time walking around the castle, visiting the collection of arms, and seeing the stables at the back of the castle. You can also grab a table at the café nearby. It is wonderful to relax with a nice glass of wine and watch the sun sink over the castle.PodcastTo hear more about visiting Kronborg and other things to do in Denmark listen to Travel to Denmark – Amateur Traveler Episode 606.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/island-running-routes/,7 Exotic Island Running Routes,Dominica,"The #runitfast hashtag has now hit 1.2 million posts on Instagram, so fitness expert Erny Peibst has mapped out running routes for all levels on some roads less travelled. Get away from it all and have a well deserved break, immersing yourself in the beautiful scenery and culture these islands have to offer.From mountain peaks to sandy beaches our planet has some incredible landscapes to explore, so pack your bags and get ready to test your endurance on these exotic islands.1. Running Route on Kauai, HawaiiKnown as the ‘Garden Island’ for its lush vegetation and steady rainfall, running on Kauai gives you an unbelievable opportunity to take in some stunning views of nature.Not only is there remarkable scenery, but along the coast, Kauai is home to white-sand beaches that stretch out into the clear turquoise water of the North Pacific Ocean.Tourists usually stick to the north of the Island, staying in places like Princeville so we’ve mapped out a route that will get you away from the busy tourist traps and allows you to take in all the treasures Kauai has to offer.The route will take you on a scenic 4-mile run along ‘The Coconut Coast’ from Wailua to Kealia. The flat, red clay path stretches along coastal cliffs giving you stunning views of the Pacific on one side and of the island’s vegetation on the other. As you take a leisurely run along the track, you may even catch a glimpse of dolphins or whales in the waters below.2. Running Route on Réunion, near MadagascarThis tiny island off the coast of Madagascar is no bigger than Dorset but rises more than 10,000 ft above the ocean and is the perfect place for any dedicated runner to test their abilities.Home to a truly untouched wilderness, the island was formed from 2 volcanoes (one of which is still active) that have created a heart-stopping natural beauty in the middle of the Indian ocean.The route mapped out starts at the small island village, Piton Sainte-Rose. The coastal town has incredible views and is the perfect place to catch the sunrise if you want to start your run early.The run totals 6.8 miles testing you on a range of terrain and revealing some breathtaking views along the way, not only of the Indian Ocean but then turning inland to the dense island vegetation.About three-quarters of the way around you will also come across an unexpected treasure in the form of Anse Waterfalls. A stunning natural waterfall that climbs 15m high with a crystal clear pool at the bottom – the perfect place for you to stop and catch your breath.*The waterfall is not on the trail and requires a slight detour. When you start to hear the sound of spraying water you will see a signpost for the waterfall with a small track that leads off the trail, take a short jog up and you will be blown away by this natural wonder.Photo by James Donaldson on Unsplash3. Running Route on Palaui, PhilippinesMade up of over 7,000 islands, you could spend months enjoying all of the remote and wondrous running trails the Philippines has to offer.If you only have a short amount of time for your trip then the one place you definitely need to go is Palaui. Located on the northeast tip of Luzon, the island is home to the nation’s capital and an international airport, it is incredibly easy to get to and well worth the 14-hour bus ride.The island is tiny but is home to an almost 6-mile trail called The Lagunzad Trail. The terrain is moderately difficult with some steep climbs up and down mountain peaks but the stunning scenery you get to take in along the route makes those burning climbs well worth it.The island was declared a National Marine Reserve in 1994 and gives you the opportunity to explore many untouched sites from white sand beaches and hidden waterfalls to clifftop views of the Philippine Sea – everything you could want from a running holiday this island has to offer.4. Running Route on Santorini, GreeceOne of the longest and most talked about trails on Santorini goes from Fira to Oia; it’s a steady descent for the entire trail but nothing even an amateur runner couldn’t handle.This is a great trail and really gives you a true taste of the Aegean experience. Starting at a picturesque port in Fira, it continues around the rim of the caldera to Oia on the southern tip of the island, passing through historic sights and Greek towns on the way.The trail takes you along spectacular cliff-tops giving you a stunning view of the sparkling blue Aegean sea that stretches for miles ahead.5. Running Route on Corsica, FranceThe French island of Corsica is home to one of the world’s most spectacular trails, the GR 20 that stretches across 111 miles.The trail winds its way along the jagged center of Corsica’s mountain range. Despite the rugged and mountainous terrain, the trail is within the capabilities of most runners.Your starting point is in Calenzana and the trail goes all the way down to Conca but the section mapped out is just 16 miles and ends in Haut-Asco. This northern part of the trail is great if you just want to go for a run rather than spend days trekking the length of the Island.The entire trail is incredibly well marked with red and white blazes so there is no chance of you getting lost as you run through the breathtaking scenery.6. Running Route on DominicaIf you’ve ever wanted to explore the jungle then Dominica is the place to go for your next ‘runcation.’ No poisonous snakes, no scary spiders, Dominica has some of the friendliest jungle in the world and the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail runs through it all.Segment four of the trail stretches from Wotten Waven to Pont Casse and is a great place to get in your run.The trail is shadowed on either side by an abundance of towering trees, buttress roots and dangling vines. One of the most spectacular waterfalls on the Island, Middleham Falls, is on this segment of the trail, the perfect place to stop and catch your breath or cool off and go for a swim.The terrain is moderately difficult, regular rainfall means you might sometimes find yourself slipping and sliding down hills and the jungle landscape means you will have to watch out for tree roots and branches ready to trip you up as you go.*There is a US$12.00 fee for a day pass to get on the trail.7. Running Route at Grace Bay, Turks, and CaicosIf the jungle isn’t really your thing and you’d rather be running across white sand beaches at sunset then Turks and Caicos is probably the island for you.Home to some of the clearest waters and softest white sand beaches you’re ever likely to find, Grace Bay beach is the crown jewel of the Caribbean.As you run along the beach looking out at the ocean, just a mile offshore you can see the protected reefs through the crystal clear water. The beach itself is always pristine (no rocks, seaweed or pollution in sight) and has been named the most breathtaking destination on the globe.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/galapagos-on-a-budget-diy-guide/,Galápagos on a Budget – DIY Guide,Ecuador,"Let’s face the truth; the Galapagos Islands are really expensive. Even with the best deals, the numbers at the end of those tours can be discouraging if you are on a tight budget. You’re paying for an international ticket, entrance fees, and cruise or land-based package. Even a deal that looks expensive after that. Here is our DIY Galapagos travel guide, which outlines budget-friendly hotels, and all spectacular Galapagos destinations you can do guide free.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Purchase these items before the Galapagos IslandsThe Habitable Galapagos IslandsSanta Cruz – DIY Galapagos Travel GuideTortuga BayThe Charles Darwin Research CenterAlemanes Beach & Las GrietasAccommodationGetting ThereSan Cristobal – DIY Galapagos Travel GuidePlaya MannInterpretation CenterLa Loberia BeachSan Cristobal Highland ToursEl CeiboGalapaguera de Cerro ColoradoRecommended Paid Tour – Kicker RockAccommodationIsabela Islands – DIY Galapagos Travel Guide Concha de PerlaThe Wall of TearsThe Crianza Arnaldo Tupiza Breeding CenterPlaya del AmorRecommended paid tours – DIY Galapagos Travel GuideSierra Negra Trek – $30 – 50Los Tuneles Snorkeling – $150Las Tintoreras – $40AccommodationFloreana – DIY Galapagos Travel GuidePost Office BayCormorant PointPlaya NegraAccommodationTransport between IslandsIn which order should you do the Islands?Not only that, but you can do it for less than 100 dollars a day, including housing, meals, and, transportation, and exploration recommend for those people that feel that the deals just aren’t cutting it, try to do one or two guided tours that take you to the places you can’t get to yourself, and then study up on how to see islands yourself! I’ve got you covered, as I’ve it all out in this DIY Galapagos Travel Guide.Purchase these items before the Galapagos IslandsIf you truly want to save some money, you need to purchase some products before you head out to the Islands. Because you are choosing a DIY approach, you will want to bring equipment to avoid rentals. Most importantly, bring your own snorkel gear, which will cost anywhere between 15-30 dollars per day per person. This set runs on Amazon for less than 40 dollars, which would offset the price of two or three rentals and more importantly save time. Get them early and try it on to make sure it fits so you aren’t cramping in the water.Additionally, bring reef-safe sunscreen and your own DEET-free bug spray, although the bugs aren’t ever a big problem Islands. Literally, everything on the islands is exponentially more expensive, including alcohol (Duty-Free, woo woo!) and snacks. Get the products before you go, and make sure the SPF is really high as the equatorial sun will burn you in 30 minutes flat if you don’t apply. Remember: Reapply, Reapply, Reapply! Don’t have the expensive vacationed ruined in one-day because you or your child got roasted.Secondly, bring lots of small bills and change. Luckily for you, no math is needed as Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar and one-dollar coins. Stack up on 5’s, 10’s and dollar coins, and don’t bring anything over 20’s.The Habitable Galapagos IslandsFour Islands of the Galapagos are habitable, in which you can spend the night in a comfortable hotel and explore the islands, totally guide free. The islands are Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Isabela, and Floreana.

On each island, there are many opportunities for visiting guide free spots for very cheap, or even free.Santa Cruz – DIY Galapagos Travel GuideThe second-largest island of Galapagos, home to black-lava shores, stunning rock cliffs, amazing lava tunnels, and pristine beaches. Santa Cruz is the closest island to the Baltra airport and is situated between Isabela and San Cristobal.Tortuga BayTortuga bay is arguably the number one free thing to do in Santa Cruz, and it is open from 6 am to 6 pm. It’s a 30-minute walk from the town of Puerto Ayora, a little longer without kids. If walking, head out early morning or evening to avoid the heat. Alternatively, you can take a taxi for $1-2. The sands of Tortuga Bay are powder-soft and brilliantly white. Along the trail, you will see the hundred-year-old prickly pear cactus, and the guests include the monstrous-looking marine iguanas, lava lizards, vividly red Sally lightfoot crabs, and Galapagos mockingbirds.Other creatures you will likely witness are the blue-footed boobies dive-bombing the turquoise waters, and sea turtles lazily floating along. You can only swim in the Playa Mansa, the second beach along the trail, where you can snorkel.

It will be around $100 for snorkeling, or 150 for scuba, including a packed lunch. This site is really awesome. When I went I saw 10+ sea turtles, two large sharks, huge schools of fish. Moreover, you get to swim through the giant rock through a canyon, and there are chances to see hammerheads within.AccommodationGalapagos Eco-Friendly $9/10 116The Dolphin House 9/10 $45Casita de la Isla 8.9/10 $55Isabela Islands – DIY Galapagos Travel GuideConcha de PerlaAn easy walk or cab from Puerto Villamil, snorkel the mangroves housing sea lions, marine Iguana, colorful fish, sea turtles, Marbel and Spotted stingrays, white-tipped reef sharks, giant pufferfish, eels, urchins, starfish, and even Galapagos Penguins.

Animals you may see include the giant tortoises, sea lions on the beaches, and marine iguanas. The end of the trail leads to the wall of tears. While not miraculous on its own, knowing the story behind it is what really makes it special.Prisoners of a penal colony constructed the wall by hand for over 14 years. In the unbearable heat, prisoners collected sharp heavy rocks to stock on the wall. The Wall of Tears likely took the lives of thousands of prisoners due to injuries, the climate, and poor treatment. Additionally, these hardened men were broken down from the impossible labor, which led to the origin of the Wall of Tear’s name.The Crianza Arnaldo Tupiza Breeding CenterOn the way to the wall of tears from the town, this center focuses on breeding tortoises. This site is similar to the Charles Darwin center on Santa Cruz, and you can see tortoises in varying stages of development.

The majority of visitors do day trips from Santa Cruz.Post Office BayHow did whalers get the mail out in the 1700s?

From there, ferry over to Santa Cruz. During this stay, consider a day trip to Floreana Island. We typically don’t recommend stays on Floreana unless you have ample time, as they ferry rides do not depart daily.

Remember, you will have to ferry back to Santa Cruz and make your way to the Baltra airport for your departure. Share this: "

Like Hawaii, Ecuador is jam-packed with these powerful and majestic waterfalls throughout the entire country. This is due to the incredible variety in Ecuador’s geography, in tandem with the sheer amount of water found within this tropical country.Many of these Ecuadorian areas contain numerous cascades, allowing you to hit three or more grand waterfalls within a half-day. At the bottom of some of these falls, you’ll also find gorgeous swimming holes, that is if you dare brave the chilly waters (Some aren’t too cold). Read on to see some of the powerful and stunning waterfalls of Ecuador.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Ecuadorian waterfall tipsWaterfalls near Quito – Ecuador’s waterfallsPeguche WaterfallsGreat pita waterfall – 18 waterfallsCondor Machay WaterfallWaterfalls Surrounding Baños de Agua SantaPailon del Diablo – Ecuador’s waterfallsMachay – Waterfall of BañosManto de la Novia – Ecuador’s WaterfallUlba and Silencio Ecuador WaterfallsWaterfalls of Coco CayamyeSan Rafael WaterfallRio Malo WaterfallSouthern Ecuador WaterfallsEl ChorroCascada PoderosaEcuador’s Coastal WaterfallsJama Coaque Reserve WaterfallsLas Cascadas de Manuel – 8 waterfallsEcuadorian waterfall tipsBring a camera.

Lots of trails to Ecuadorian waterfalls are rocky, slippery, and at high elevation.Have a sweater and towel in a waterproof bag. The waters can be cold, and the mist will spray you even if you don’t get in. You’ll want a warm jacket and some sweatpants for the journey home.Bring water for the hikes. Many of them have decent elevation gradients and you’ll want to hydrate.Take your time on these waterfall hikes and listen to your body, as the elevation can be tough.Waterfalls near Quito – Ecuador’s waterfallsPeguche WaterfallsThis waterfall is close to the town of Otavalo, where you will find the famous animal markets and one of the largest indigenous textile markets in the country. You can easily take a bus from Quito, and enjoy all the city and nature areas have to offer. The waterfall is a ceremonial site for the Inte Raymi (Sun and Harvest) yearly festival. Legend states that there is a bowl formed of gold within the waterfall. Two black hounds sitting beside the throne of the devil protect this bowl. This devil holds a small plate of sand, which is slowly washed away by the waterfall. It is said that when the last grain of sand disappears from the plate, the soul is taken of whoever enters the waterfall.Great pita waterfall – 18 waterfallsThis great Ecuadorian waterfall in the heart of the Andes is an impressive sight and is one of eighteen waterfalls along the pita river. This one is the tallest, at 60 meters, making a wonderful photo. The best part is this is only an hour outside of downtown Quito, making it an easy day trip if you want to get out the concrete jungle and into nature within minutes.Condor Machay WaterfallThis Ecuadorian waterfall is a quick hour drive from Quito, and the area is both pristine and powerful. The title translates to the nest of the condor, which is the emblematic Ecuadorian bird species symbolizing a protector on the national flag.The highest area offers Baños magnificent scenery, overlooking the Avenue of the Volcanoes, a famous route of volcanoes along the Andes ranging from massive snow-capped volcanoes to lesser but still impressive peaks.Along the path starting at the “Caldera,” you’ll find gorgeous orchids, trout swimming the crystalline river in their natural state, the zebra-striped caracaras, and a forest full of natural vegetation. The whole hike lasts between 3-5 hours round trip depending on your pace.Direction by Car, use WAZE to get to Barrio Selva Alegre, Sangolqui, Ecuador. Then follow the directions on the above map.Direction by Public Transportation for buses to Sangolqui, use the Google Map link and click on get directions. Use the public transportation option to find the best from your current location. From Selva Alegre, you will likely have to hire a taxi though there are bus stops along the road out to Condor Machay.Waterfalls Surrounding Baños de Agua SantaBaños, the waterfall capital, is a quaint town 2.5 to 3 hours from Quito with a lot of activities to do including rafting, mountain biking, canyoning, zip-lining, and more. However, what really captured my attention when I spent the new years here was all the spectacular waterfalls. The best part is that we were able to easily see three in one day, and we left without seeing all of them.Pailon del Diablo – Ecuador’s waterfallsThis is without a doubt the most recognized and famous waterfall in Ecuador. It’s easy to get to, the trails are beautiful, and the waterfall is an absolute monster. The significance of the name in English is “The Devil’s Cauldron.” It is the tallest waterfall of the Ecuadorian Andes, and the waters plunge 200 feet into a cauldron shaped gorge below. One aspect that makes this Ecuadorian waterfall so spectacular is the steep winding staircase bringing you closer and closer toward the waterfall until you have a spectacular view. But wait, it gets even better. Keep walking the path until you will actually stroll behind the waterfall, and feel the roaring of the water plunging and the mist will definitely get you wet. The clear waters of the Río Verde feed this waterfall. Although this waterfall is a little touristy, I still highly recommend it.Machay – Waterfall of BañosYou’ll find this waterfall with a 20-30 minute winding bus drive from Baños. This waterfall has a 15-minute downhill hike with tons of beautiful flowers and interesting tropical leaves. A few minutes into the trail, we could hear the rumbling of the waterfall. This is a common tantalizing experience you’ll have with many of the other trails leading to these giant waterfalls, as most require a short hike that obscures the vision until the last moment.I went in the evening, and I was able to capture some great photographs of the flowers with my camera phone. The Machay waterfall is actually composed of two waterfalls. The first is a very tall cascade falling down a rock face full of tropical vegetation and trees. I don’t recommend swimming in the first pools, as the rapids are strong and a few meters after the first began the second, a smaller 10-meter waterfall with lots of rocks. You can climb down a flight of stairs leading to the river below, and you’ll find a spot with a rope crossing the river. You can hop off a rock into the middle of the rapids, which was a ton of fun. It also wasn’t too cold, an important added bonus.Manto de la Novia – Ecuador’s WaterfallThis roughly translates to the Veil of the Bride. The name derives from the beautiful double waterfall resembling the headpiece worn by brides before tying the knot, and it really makes for a spectacular photo. You can choose between a $2 cable car or walking a suspension bridge. To do this, you can take a tour from the city center of Baños, or simply do it yourself with a 50-cent bus. Add the waterfall on Google maps, and then tell the conductor to get off at the waterfall (Cascada)Ulba and Silencio Ecuador WaterfallsThis hike contained two waterfalls, and it was very easy to traverse the hike. Less than 10 minutes from the entrance, we got to the first waterfall, and five minutes to the second. You’ll have to cough up 50 cents a person to get to the waterfall, so remember to bring some small change. The Ulba waterfall isn’t very tall, but for what it lacks in height it makes up for in power. The water was exploding from the river into the pool below. Taking a dip in this one is definitely doable, with a little bit of caution. If you got too close to the right side, you could get sucked into the rapids so stick to the edge of the left side if you want to brave it.Silencio was a five-minute walk from the Ulba waterfall. This was more of a slow-moving cascading waterfall. We also got to watch a fun and exhilarating spectacle from the bottom. An adventure tour agency was taking guests on a canyoning adventure, where daredevils rapidly repelled down the waterfall wearing wetsuits, helmets, and climbing gear.Waterfalls of Coco CayamyeThis park marks one of the entrances to the Amazon rainforest, and it was a ton of fun. I went on a tour that visited three waterfalls, and two of them were truly spectacular. It was lightly raining for most of the day, but it didn’t dampen our spirits because of it very warm in the Amazon regardless of the temperature. These waterfalls were really unique because of the sheer force, size, and volume of water expelling from these beasts.San Rafael WaterfallThis was one of Ecuador’s truly colossal waterfalls, standing at 150 meters of height. This was a half-hour stroll from the road. The tropical leaves were massive, and the birdlife was very active. It was a little misty that day, so every few minutes we would get a clear gap to take stunning pictures. The water thunders down from above, causing the mist to spit up and circle from the pool below, creating an extraordinary picture. Moreover, the forest surrounding the river from above is truly wild. From the trail we took, we weren’t able to walk to the bottom. However, the view from across the way was breathtaking and definitely one of the coolest waterfalls I’ve seen in my life. However, I think the next one might have taken the cake for me.Rio Malo WaterfallOf all the waterfall experiences in Ecuador, this might be my favorite. The Cascada rivaled San Rafael in terms of power, but not in height. It was about 20 meters-30 meters tall. You could feel the mist of this powerful cascade from 50 meters away. What made this Ecuadorian waterfall truly special was that you could get up close and personal, and even swim in the waters below. The water was a little chilly, but I was able to swim pretty close to the base of the waterfall and even sit on a rock nearby. The volume of mist spraying and the powerful gale caused by the waterfall made me feel as if I was standing in a hurricane. I then floated down the river for a few meters, which was very relaxing.Southern Ecuador WaterfallsEl ChorroThis is a small Ecuadorian mountain town 45 minutes to an hour from the city of Cuenca. Note that the elevation is pretty high, so make sure you are acclimated to the higher altitude before doing on any hiking, otherwise, you may end up with a pretty good headache by the end. This adventure has delicious trout to eat, and a waterfall that is absolutely gorgeous. From the parking lot, you will go on a short hike leading to some stairs. These stairs take you to the base of this Southern Ecuadorian waterfall. Bring a raincoat or poncho, or a towel in a dry bag, as you will get misted by the waterfall. If you are feeling extra adventurous, you can do an extreme 2-hour hike to an upper platform that leads to wonderful views. Otherwise, you can do zip-lining or trout fishing for reasonable prices.Cascada PoderosaThis Ecuadorian waterfall is a little more secluded than the rest, located within the Podocarpus National Park. This park lies 4 miles from the city of Zamora, the capital of Zamora-Chinchipe province. You can hike to the top and bottom of the 70-meter waterfall and get wonderful pictures. Moreover, there are camping areas for backpackers.Ecuador’s Coastal WaterfallsJama Coaque Reserve WaterfallsThis area was the first place I visited in Ecuador, and it had some truly stunning waterfalls. Moreover, this destination has extraordinary biodiversity of monkeys, hundreds of birds, and a beautiful bamboo house on the property. For ten dollars, you can go on miles and miles of hiking trails. A few cross paths with the pristine river Camarones (shrimp), and you’ll find a few beautiful cascades with various types of hummingbirds fluttering between the various flowers along the way. This area isn’t the easiest to get to, with an uphill hike of 1.7 miles from the town of Camarones. But the reward of the biodiversity and waterfalls is definitely is worth the trip.Las Cascadas de Manuel – 8 waterfallsThis is another beautiful coastal waterfall, leading to a grand waterfall with an awesome swimming pit. Go with shoes that you can get wet. Moreover, there is a nice little restaurant/hotel nearby. Here, you can also spend the night and have a full day and night of relaxation.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/guide-to-buses-in-quito-ecuador/,Guide to Buses in Quito Ecuador,Ecuador,"Quito Ecuador is one of the best places to visit in South America, but when I first came to live in Quito, understanding the public transportation system was a little overwhelming. The local Ecuadorians, even my Ecuadorian girlfriend, tried to explain the system various times. However, it didn’t quite stick until I sat down and did the research on my own. Since then, traveling around Quito by bus is fairly easy. You just have to have a visual understanding of the City layout and learn some of the main bus routes and stations. Here is a compilation of easy to understand information and tips so you can travel around the city with safety and ease.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Step 1: Understand Safety of Quito Public TransportationSafety Tips for Quito Public TransportationStep 2.

Understand Safety of Quito Public TransportationKeep close watch on your valuables!Understanding safety is the first priority, as Quito can be a dangerous city if you are at the wrong place at the wrong time, or in certain places at any time. If you are choosing to use buses, you likely want to save a little bit of money or embrace the local experience. I admit it is exhilarating and satisfying to navigate the country as a local, commanding your way around a city on the Buses of Quito.However, heed this warning: thievery is a danger in Quito and Ecuador overall. A 3-5 dollar taxi is less expensive than losing your smartphone, nice camera, or anything else of value on public transportation. I have lived in the city for a year, and I haven’t had an item stolen or been mugged by following a few simple rules. The two most important of them: never carry around more than 40 dollars in your wallet, and never carry your passport. Keep a Photocopy of the passport, as getting a new passport abroad can be a total nightmare. Keep your bills smalls, think 5s and 10s. And plenty of quarters for buses.Safety Tips for Quito Public TransportationTravel on buses during the day. At night, thievery is more common, especially if you have been drinking in the city and your focus isn’t tip-top.Thieves don’t have a “look”, they can be children, innocent-looking woman, or a regular looking guy.Don’t walk far from the bus stops or attractions if you are outside of the Mariscal or historic center. Take an uber or taxi once exiting the bus.When sitting or riding on buses, don’t put your bag on the floor or on a rack above. The back will be slashed with a knife from behind, and your items were taken without you ever noticing. Don’t place anything on the top racks of buses leaving Quito, it will likely be stolen. Keep the bags on your lap.If you are a foreigner, you are already a target. Don’t carry around a Nikon DSLR or any valuables in wide-open visibility.Keep your important electronics in an inner pocket of a jacket. If it is too hot for a jacket, put all the items in one pocket, and keep your hand in that pocket on top of the items the whole time while the other hand supports for stability.If you have a backpack, wear the bag in front and be sure to keep vigilant even when it is in front. The thieves on Quito buses generally aren’t the confrontational type. They try to steal without you noticing.Step 2. Use Offline MapsOn your smartphone, download or visit google maps. Download an offline map of the city of Quito. It will not be a large download, and even if you are out of wifi and cellular signal, your location will update as you move. Additionally, you can add important bus stations and destinations you want to visit. This process was crucial to me learning the city. A hard map is great for small cities like Bruges, but Quito is too big to be effective. A quick check of an offline map and I knew which bus stop was closest to my location.However, I advise all tourists not to pull out their phones while walking around the city. This could end in a snatch and grab, especially if you have an expensive phone. Rather, step into a store or restaurant and take a quick check of the map. Count how many streets away and which street to turn. Remember, most locals are happy to help, just write your destination if you aren’t confident in your Spanish accent.Detailed instructions on downloading offline mapsImportant Quito Bus Terminals / StationsRio CocaAn important terminal for transferring to the bus stop in the valley of Quito called Cumbaya.

See Trole section for details.Step 3: A Vertical City – Quito Bus GuideQuito’s colonial sector at nightThe third step in learning the Quito bus system is first visualizing the layout of the city. This city a vertical city, with the majority of buses running North to South. The main Quito attractions fall within a 25-mile vertical limit, with Mitad de Mundo (Middle of the earth) at the northern limit, and the Panecillo at the Southern Limit.The city does extend beyond this area, but the main tourist attractions of Quito fall within these limits. You can spend months exploring the city just within these boundaries. As for horizontal orientation, most of the attractions of Quito are a mile and a half distance from east to west. Once you are perpendicular to your destination of interest, you simply need to take a quick uber, taxi, or walk!North-South Bus RoutesEcoviaThis bus runs down the avenue “Seis de Diciembre,” or “Sixth of December.” This road is the Easternmost North-South Route. The Northernmost station is called Rio Coca, an important terminal for transferring to a bus stop in the valley of Quito called Cumbaya. The Ecovia stops are in a structure placed in the middle of the street, and buses going north or south stop at the same structure, unlike Trole and metrobus.

But before you decide which to take, read about the options so you understand the whole picture.Uber service in QuitoUber is certainly a huge presence in Ecuador, and I highly recommend this service over any other in the city of Quito for its superior prices, drivers, and professionalism. The perks? You can see the estimated price beforehand, uber drivers go through background checks, the cars are safe, and they are always present in every part of the city. They generally arrive within 3-5 minutes in the busier areas.A little unknown fact, however, is that uber in Ecuador is not a registered company in Ecuador, and drivers face high fines if they are caught providing the Uber service. The drivers will kindly ask a guest to sit in front, in order to avoid any suspicion. I have ridden in hundreds of Ubers in the city, and have never had an issue. Know that you will not face any issues if the driver was by chance caught.Why is the uber not registered in the Country? The organization of public transportation, including buses and taxis, are vehemently against uber, as they are a big competitor. This organization has a lot of power and influence in the government, and they have spoken their piece about the organization.Taxi Safety in QuitoTaxis are an effective means of getting around Quito, and they are quite affordable too. The general price will be $1.50-3 dollars for short trips, and $4-7 for longer trips. The airport trip will cost you $20-25. Know that the minimum price during the day is $1.50, and 2.00 at night, despite what the taximeter reads.It is important to follow some safety tips in order to make sure you get to your destination safely. There are a lot of cabs, but not all of them are legitimate. If you don’t use the following advice, you may find yourself in a taxi that will up-charge the rate significantly, or worse an unsafe driver with bad intentions.The first step is identifying a properly licensed taxi. Legal taxis will have their taxi registration number in 5-inch numbers on the windshield or on the door or a 4 digit sticker on the window. Check for a license plate in the front and back, and a company name on the side of the car.Insist taxi drivers use the taxi meter, while is required by law during the day. (“por favor, usa el taximetro” in spanish). If they resist, find another.If you are on the streets, look for If you are in a restaurant, bar, or hotel, the staff will be happy to help hail a cab for you.If you are alone at night, call a friend or pretend to be on the phone while in the taxi. Always a good safety tip in taxisWrite down the registration number and get a good look at the driver. Another great preventative measure.Keep a hawk’s eye on the taxi meter. Make sure it isn’t magically jumping up a 50 cents in a few seconds.Tipping – Quito Bus GuideTipping isn’t common by locals for taxis, but very much appreciated. If a driver assists with bags, a tip of a dollar would put a smile on their face!Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-in-the-shadow-of-the-volcano-by-maureen-klovers/,Book Review: In the Shadow of the Volcano by Maureen Klovers,Ecuador,"Maureen Klover’s book In the Shadow of the Volcano is not only an enjoyable read, but incredibly refreshing.  Rather than rehash an itinerary or sights to be seen, she delves deeper by focusing on the “Why” that sent her traveling.   Why cultures think and behave the way they do, Why she was inspired to travel, Why her adventure was so deeply moving. Klover answers these questions by determinedly following twists, turns and bumpy roads taking the reader along for the ride. She also highlights time and again that travel is most memorable not just for the where or when, but for who you meet along the way.As a U.S. Intelligence Officer, Klover’s focus was on Latin America but other than a few weeks of travel there, her experience was primarily based on books, newspapers and reports.  A chance conversation with a student of hers changes all that by firmly planting the seed of a gripping question.  She couldn’t shake it, she had to figure out the psyche of Latin America, needed to understand the “why” that drives them.  Determined to find the answer, Maureen forgoes resort-like opportunities and instead buys a ticket to Ecuador and commits to a volunteer teaching position at a Jesuit charity. The characters she introduced us to along the way are vivid and memorable and will likely stick with you after the last page.In the Shadow of the Volcano isn’t made out to be strictly a thriller, dramatic or humorous memoir but it contains excellent moments of each.  Her experiences weave an entertaining and compelling story of her time in Ecuador that alternately makes the reader want to sign up and then be thankful they’re safely at home.   I particularly resonated with the epilogue in which she reveals her raw emotions of how Ecuador changed her.  That in short is why so many travel, to have these experiences and understand other cultures.  Klover’s book doesn’t treat travel as a map to pin or list to check off, instead it compels the reader to go there, to live it, to let a place and culture get inside of you and take a piece of it home.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/sunday-strolls-through-quito-ecuador/,"Sunday Strolls through Quito, Ecuador",Ecuador,"Sunday in Quito, Ecuador is a time for family, recreation, and long strolls through the park. Street vendors heat up their burners, churning out hot corn kernels called mote. Shops tighten bolts on bike rentals and young couples meander down the main streets, browsing for clothes, candies, and CDs. On Sundays, Avenida Amazonas shuts out motorized traffic and offers pedestrians a wide boulevard for exploring Quito’s charms.Rent a Pedal Car for the KidsIn El Ejido Park, families picnic and enjoy the cool shade from lumbering trees. Twenty-something’ers walk their dogs and artisans sell clothing, accessories, and jewelry. Adults can shop and sunbathe for hours, which may seem like a boring nightmare for kids. But in the central square, vendors offer one of the best entertainment investments for children up to age 12: pedal cars. All cars are themed and painted to look like antique cars, animals, and sea mammals. Most have two rows, so multiple siblings can squeeze in for a spin down the park path.Bike Ride down Avenida AmazonasOnce closed to vehicular traffic, Avenida Amazonas is a biking haven with mountain bikes, tricycles, red wagons, and old school bucket basket bikes flying east and west all day long. In the early morning, tents pop up along the avenue and offer bicycle repair services for faulty brakes, loose chains, and seat adjustments. Just stay to the right, teenagers can be biking daredevils in the middle lane.Play Soccer in La Alameda ParkSoccer is a national past time. Ecuadorians play it on the beach, in the street, and on Sundays, at El Ejido Park. Shoes or plastic water bottles become goal stands while families ranging from five-year-olds to old uncle Eduardo take the field. Swearing is common as multi-generational members boast, jab, and bicker over the score. Start your own match. Or lay back on a blanket for relaxation and entertainment.People Watch in Plaza FochIn New Town’s trendy nightlife district, Sundays are about coffee and treats at sidewalk cafes. Blended mochas and fresh fruit shakes called batidos make a great reward for walking the pedestrian strip. Head for the main square and choose a restaurant with an upper balcony. Sometimes menus may be limited upstairs but the views are worth that sacrifice.Sunday strolls in Quito can bring you to the best corners of the capital, past historic statues and trendy cafes as well as to grassy fields that are perfect for napping. So many families retreat to parks and neighborhoods around Avenida Amazonas that you’ll think every house in the city is empty for the day. Considering Quito’s high altitude and deceptively strong sun, you’ll want to take it easy and kick back on your weekends.Melissa (but not the Amateur Traveler) was sponsored by Vaya Adventures, a Latin America travel agent, to write this post.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-must-see-sights-on-your-baltic-tour/,6 Must-See Sights on your Baltic Tour,Estonia,"While the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania may not seem like the premier travel destination for the discriminating traveler, nothing could be further from the truth. These former Soviet bloc countries are rich in history and both natural and architectural beauty, and veteran travelers the world over are discovering this region’s unique cultural flavor. With manor houses and castles dating back to the mid-fourteenth century or even earlier, this area combines the stark beauty of Eastern Europe with some of the most breathtaking and impressive art and architecture to be found anywhere on the planet. These six sites are among the most famous and spectacular in the region, making them “must-see” stops on your Baltic tour!Turaida Castle, Sigulda, LatviaThis Brick Gothic masterpiece of medieval architecture was constructed under the aegis of Albert, Archbishop of Riga. Built atop the ruins of Caupo of Turaida’s castle, which was built of wood and later razed to the ground, this striking edifice was recently restored to its former glory. Featuring a commanding view of the forests and hills around Sigulda, Turaida Castle stands as an amazing monument to Eastern European ingenuity and architectural know-how.Cesis Castle, Cesis, LatviaCesis Castle stands as a perfect example of what modern Westerners often think of when they hear the word “castle.” The original castle, known as Wenden Castle, began construction in 1237 CE as the residence of the German Master of Order. Over the next three centuries, fortifications to encircle the strategically important town of Cesis continued at a steady pace. The castle was attacked during the Livonian War (1558-1583). One of the most notorious actions of this war occurred when defenders in the west wing of the castle set off explosives, destroying the wing and themselves rather than submit to the rule of Ivan the Terrible. While much of the castle is in ruins, the reconstruction of the castle has been ongoing for around two centuries.Tallinn City Wall, Tallinn, EstoniaThis amazing fortification, originally consisting of forty-six named towers and nearly two and a half kilometers of walls, is not only an impressive example of medieval defensive thought and strategy but encloses Tallinn, one of the most beautiful and unspoiled cities in Europe. Constructed by the order of Margaret Sambiria, the wall was initially named for her. The original structure was less than five meters tall and a meter and a half wide at the base, but has since been added to.Tallinn City HallAmid the medieval splendor of Tallinn rises the new City Hall building, created in 2009 by the Bjarke Ingels Group, a Danish architectural firm. The soaring and airy modern design is intended to evoke the finest principles of democracy, including transparency and thus accountability of government to its people. As a monument to participatory government, the Tallinn City Hall is impressive, but as a feat of modern engineering in the Baltic, it is truly in a class by itself.Lithuanian Art Museum, Vilnius, LithuaniaBuilt in 1933 to house and showcase the best of Lithuanian art from the medieval period to the modern day, the Lithuanian Art Museum incorporates classic Greek design sensibilities but merges them with a modern European flair. The result is a building that is just as amazing for its exterior as the works of art that adorn its interior. Among the oldest pieces in the museum is a portrait of Stanislovas Sabina, a renowned official of Vilnius, created by N.A. Flensburgite in 1590. The museum was commissioned to preserve the Lithuanian national character and flavor for future generations and includes some of the most celebrated and controversial Lithuanian artists in its halls.Vilnius Cathedral of Sts. Peter and PaulThis breathtaking cathedral dates as far back as Lithuanian Christianization and is the oldest church in the nation. Construction began under the rule of King Mindaugas, who was baptized along with his family in 1251. Although the cathedral has been destroyed and rebuilt several times during its history, with the current structure dating from the mid-1400s, historical documents indicate that the Cathedral of Vilnius has largely stayed true to the original scope, scale, and grandeur to which it was originally constructed. The catacombs beneath the cathedral are a treasure trove of Christian and Lithuanian history, and these catacombs are open to the public for tours. In addition to its status as a historical site, the Cathedral is also an important archaeological site whose many layers provide a fascinating glimpse into the techniques and methods of thirteenth-century masons, sculptors, and other artisans. The Cathedral of Vilnius continues to hold services and Latin Mass weekly, a testament to this magnificent building’s enduring importance to the Lithuanian people.This article was supplied by www.baltictravelcompany.comShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/chocolate-quest-in-tallinn-estonia/,"Chocolate Quest in Tallinn, Estonia",Estonia,"Tallinn, Estonia – View from Upper TownEstonia, a small country on the Baltic Sea is independent and thriving as can be.  This tiny country, a tad bigger than the state of Maryland is located near its former oppressor Russia and modern Finland.  Now enjoying political independence for twenty years, the capitol of Tallinn maintains its heritage of a medieval city with fortified walls and authentic medieval food and drink.  On this port call from our cruise ship, I decided to search for the oldest chocolate store and marzipan museum in Tallinn, Kalev Chocolates to satisfy my sweet cravings.Walking around side streets to the town square, I noticed people passing by small shops, restaurants, and churches in an unhurried manner and with a sense of calmness.  Beautiful linen fabrics hung in a window and the shop owner busily folded fabrics and sorted colorful yarns.  I couldn’t help but step inside to explore the woven fabrics and the owner speaking very good English told me the material comes from the interior of Estonia. I couldn’t bring back rolls of fabric and I settled on a linen robe and bath sponge which was easy to pack as souvenirs from this well preserved town.  I only had a few hours left before our ship was to set sail and I still needed to find the chocolate store.I scurried my way around narrow streets noticing the decorated hand carved wooden doors.  Colorful and individually designed doors allowed entrance and protected the town’s people from foreign invaders, yet signified their sense of harmony within the village. Finally reaching the main square in town on this sunny afternoon, tourists and locals alike were enjoying the inexpensive beer and tastes of the town filling every table and chair.  With so much activity before me, I anxiously glanced around the store fronts hoping to spot the chocolate shop.  A kind local pointed out the shop to me and my senses were heightened when I walked up the worn marbled steps and through the framed glass doors.Chocolates in TallinnKalev Chocolates dates back over two hundred years and I was introduced to the company diplomat, Otto Kubo. He proudly showed me the display case arranged with many varieties of delicious looking chocolate pieces filled with marzipan. He hand selected several chocolates and carefully arranged them on a small silver tray and offered them to me. Each bite was divine as I savored the white and dark chocolate with the almond filling of marzipan.  With a fun twist, he told me the almonds used to make the marzipan come from California. Growing up in California, I immediately remembered the almond groves in the central valley and now I was 6,000 miles away eating a bit of one of our state’s top crops.Inside the shop is the marzipan decorating area and with steady hands; the woman hand painted marzipan chick figurines and lined up the colorful yellow chicks with freshly painted orange eyes and noses.  There is a nice display of old fashioned candy molds and pictures with the history of marzipan and chocolate making from years past.  A sweets connoisseur is near heaven here.Mr. Kubo, wanting to share the traditions of his homeland with me suggested I try Olde Hansa Restaurant, a true medieval restaurant in the center of town.  Only foods from medieval times are served including brown bear from their forests.  I looked at my watch and said I needed to return to the ship, waved good bye and devoured another piece of chocolate disappearing into the crowd.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/travel-egypt-place-like-egypt/,Travel to Egypt – There is No Place Like Egypt,Egypt,"The question travel bloggers hate is “what is your favorite country?” When pressed, the country I am most likely to name is Egypt. The first Amateur Traveler tour was a photo tour of Egypt. Egypt is a complex, chaotic, colorful, And culturally rich country.Listen to more about our Egypt trup at Photo Tour of Egypt – Amateur Traveler Episode 255.ChaosThere were definitely moments that Egypt took us out of our comfort zone. My wife and I arrived alone at the Cairo airport at nearly midnight. The process of getting our entry visas was not straightforward. As we walked into the night a jovial stranger greeted us and offered to procure a cab for us. We soon found ourselves heading into the darkness following a man we didn’t know who was carrying both our suitcases. My wife asked me if I thought this was a particularly good idea but my gut said it was OK. True to his word he led us to a cab driver and after a brief conversation that we didn’t understand we were launched into Cairo traffic.Our cab driver darted and weaved past other cars, past foolhardy pedestrians and slow-moving donkey carts. I closed my eyes more than once. Even it nearly 1 AM the city was very much alive. It only took stopping twice to ask another stranger for directions before our cab driver crossed the busy city and delivered us to our hotel.The Great PyramidAs a lover of history, trying to understand how old the Great Pyramid is challenges me. Our guide, an egyptologist, told us the pyramid was built during the Old Kingdom. It was built so long ago that the name of the invaders who toppled the old Kingdom have been lost to the mists of time. The invaders had a technological edge over the Egyptians of that time. They had the wheel and chariots.Standing at the only remain remaining wonder of the seven wonders of the ancient world took my breath away. The Great Pyramid was already over 2000 years old when that list was created in the 1st century.Upper EgyptWe took an early morning (middle of the night really) flight south to Upper Egypt. We arrived just as the sun was coming up. We took a boat out to the temple to Isis and Philae. I had to wonder if the designers of Disneyland jungle cruise ride had seen these boats as they looked eerily familiar. As we got off the bus to get on the boats a crowd of vendors descended on our guide who had the omnipotent power to choose a few of them to accompany us on the boat ride and have exclusive access to our attention.HieroglyphicsOur guide deciphered the hieroglyphics on the temple for us. But the hieroglyphics don’t change that much from one temple to another. Here is our good pharaoh (fill in the blank with Pharaoh’s name). See how the gods smile on him. See how they gave him life. You should listen to this guy. The pharaoh might be one of the 11 named Rameses from the New Kingdom or one of 14 named Ptolemy but the message was basically the same. I got to the point where I could pick out the cartouche for Ramesses or Ptolemy on the temples from sheer repetition.A cartouche is a proper name in hieroglyphics and it is surrounded by an oval as in the above photo. Ramesses starts with ‘Ra’ or sun so the cartouche on the left that has a sun at the top is his.Nubian VillageAgain in the early light of dawn, we boarded a boat and sailed up the Nile to where boys and men on camels greeted us at the beach. Now I know a camel ride sounds like the ultimate tourist service thing to do, but I swear to you my wife will still get giddy if you mention her camel from Egypt. Each of the camels seem to have their own personality as Joan’s camel nuzzled with the person in front of her in our caravan. I swear my camel smiled and mugged for the camera when I went to take his picture.This the fine sand along the shores of the Nile made advantage of a camel ride obvious even for a quarter of a mile. Walking up the hill of sand was a chore for us but our faithful ships of the desert handled the task with ease.The Nubian people are a beautiful people and with their dark skin, I was reminded of my trip to sub-Saharan Africa. Spices and dyes added to the color palette of the scene.MemphisWith as much history to see in Egypt, it is amazing to think about how much history has been lost. You cannot visit Memphis which was the capital of the Old Kingdom in Egypt.One of the artifacts that you can see from Memphis is the Colossus of Memphis which is a statue of Rameses II lying down inside a museum built for it in Cairo. The colossus is about 36 feet long (without its feet) – it is so large that you can only get a good shot from the balcony above.Valley of the KingsMost of the tombs of the pharaohs from the New Kingdom were hidden in the Valley of the Kings. Most were discovered and looted centuries ago.Tutankhamun’s tombTutankhamun’s tomb is notable not for size, its grandeur or the uniqueness of its treasure but for being undiscovered for so long and therefore intact when discovered in the 1800s. The tomb itself was claustrophobic. It is surprisingly small in size when you consider how many of the riches in the Cairo Museum came from this one tomb. Photographs from the opening of the tomb show a ramshackle pile of treasure that would rival the worst garage of your pack-rat neighbor.With amazing timing we just happened to be in the tomb of Tutankhamun when egyptologists opened the outer sarcophagus to check on it’s contents. You could come back for decades and not have so rare and encounter with history. Some of the other tombs for the more major pharaohs were stunning. The art on the walls was still colorful millennia after the tomb was built. Arrive as early in the day as you can to avoid the crowds.These are just some of the highlights of our trip. Our pictures only capture part of the trip. World War II battlefields, quiet beaches, noisy marketplaces, horse drawn carriage rides, temples, churches, mosques, monasteries, desert landscapes and the life giving Nile all await you in this amazing land.For tours to Egypt check out our sponsor Monarch budget holidays.

https://amateurtraveler.com/do-big-bus-tour-groups-have-advantages/,Do Big Bus Tour Groups Have Advantages?,Egypt,"Cosmos Tour Group – Giza Egypt 2010On the BusI feel fortunate that I got to take a tour to Egypt last November and doubly so because of all that is happening in that country now. But before the tour, I was a bit nervous. In part because it was the first Amateur Traveler tour so at least some of the people were coming because I told them it would be fun. But I was also nervous because I have traditionally been an independent traveler and I was not so sure about the idea of traveling with a busload of people. I put on the tour with Photography PhotoEnrichment.com, but our tour was part of a larger tour from Cosmos which is the budget brand of Globus Tours.My big fear was winding up on a busload of whiny people. Now, granted I have sometimes traveled with whiny people that I am related to, but doing so with strangers did not sound that fun. I will admit that some of this bias against tours has also rubbed off from other travel blogger friends. After the tour, I have to say I enjoyed it. Did it convert me to take my next trip on a big tour bus? Probably not, but I was intrigued with this letter I received from Enid who had come on the tour with us (used with Enid’s permission of course):EnidHi Chris and Ralph:I thought you might be interested in some feedback on our Egypt trip. I’ve been thinking a lot about it because it has really shaped my plans for future travel. The trip was not at all what I expected and I loved it.I had only taken one tour before — a tour of India entitled, Following in the Footsteps of Carl Jung. It was a small group, about 15, and we had daily discussions of Jung. The accommodations were excellent and the food was spectacular.That was sort of what I expected this time, which was probably silly on my part since that trip was much more expensive than this one. I never thought I would enjoy one of these comparatively down market bus tours in the company of 30 or 40 touristas. Chris, from the comments you have made, I take it you are still not inclined towards that form of travel.Excursion to Abu SimbelBut when I thought about it, I realized that I had not enjoyed the company on the Jung trip. Since we were an intimate and limited group, each person’s idiosyncrasies exerted a great influence on everyone else. Similarly, I would have enjoyed this trip much less if I had only the photography group for company. I know that is a politically incorrect statement (at best), but I enjoyed being able to interact with many different people and our very excellent guide was able to effectively herd the large group. Individual idiosyncrasies were less grating. I actually made two real friends on the trip, one from the photography group and one from the general population, with whom I remain in touch.I would like to have had more photographic time. Perhaps if we could have left the group more often or even just more discussions during the off hours. The limited amount of time we had was very very valuable to me and I look forward to Ralph’s feedback on the pictures I uploaded ( even doing that was a major accomplishment for me). I found the food to be shockingly unsatisfactory until we got on the boat. But, when I think about how cheap the trip was and how much we got for our money, that seems very forgivable. (I think the Indian tour was almost 3 times as expensive and, since we had different tour guides at each site, they were of an uneven quality. Even the best did not beat Hesham.)Our Wonderful Guide – HeshamI have traveled many different ways, alone, with friends, with a husband, and I find that my favorite, as of now, is in a bus with a big group of touristas. How amazing. And so I am scouring sites like Cosmos, Smartours, ABC Travel for other incredibly affordable adventures. Of course, if they have a photographic aspect, all the better, so keep me informed of where you are going next.EnidOur tour group had been a cross section of mostly English speaking tourists. Lots of people from England, some from the U.S., Ireland and Australia as well. And Enid is right, we met some very nice people. Was there any whining? Yes, there was some but all in all it was a fun group.Photographic ToursI should point out that Ralph had a similar reaction to Enid about the amount of time to add in a photographic component on the tour and has switched his tours to use Globus’ Monogram Tours which are geared more for independent travelers.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-words-that-dont-mean-the-same-thing-in-egypt/,6 Words That Don’t Mean The Same Thing in Egypt,Egypt,"I loved our trip to Egypt. I loved the people and the sites but occasionally things came up where I realized that even when people were speaking to me in English, some words did not mean the same thing in Egypt as they did in the U.S.Illegal – The first time that I realized that a word our guide was using had a different meaning was when he was pointing out a tuk-tuk on our way back to Cairo. These small motorized rickshaws are imported from India and China. “These are illegal in Egypt” he told us. Then proceeded to tell us that there were over a million of them and that people bought them from the tuk-tuk dealerships that were easily found in every city.Forbidden – I am used to photography being forbidden in certain historic sites so I always try and check before I take pictures to see if it is allowed. What I was not prepared for was guards who were encouraging me to take pictures anyway. This first happened at a small temple next to the Great Pyramid on our first day. Our guide explained that the guards only make about $2 a day and need to supplement their income to live. So they encourage you to take forbidden photographs… for a price of course.Included – Our guide had trouble with this word as he tried to communicate it to varies camel and horse carriage drivers. He was paying them a tip directly and explicitly told them all not to ask their passengers for an additional tip. All of them asked anyway.Authentic – Our guide told us before our first stop that people would offer us many different products that were “authentic” and “made in Egypt”. Most would be made in China. “Buy them if you like them” he told us, but just know what you are getting. Similarly things made of stone were sometimes made of plastic and things made of papyrus were made of banana leaves. There may be truth in advertising laws in Egypt, but if there are they certainly don’t apply at the tourist stops.No – When the 12th person came up to me to sell me an authentic (fake) carved (molded) stone (plastic) pyramid and I said “no”, they assumed I was negotiating. If there is a phrase that means “no thanks, I really don’t want to buy what you have”, I never discovered it.This is one of the posts that gets me in trouble because it sounds negative, but my real point is more that Egypt is different and to just accept some of those differences. Too often we travel to someplace because it is different but then complain that it is different. So let me leave you with a more positive difference.Long Time – Our guide told us that when two friends see each other who have not seen each other in a “long time” it is custom to hug and kiss on the cheek. How long is a long time? According to him it was 2 weeks.Egypt is a more intense culture than the U.S. and most western countries. They bargain harder, they argue louder but they may also  cherish friends greater.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/camino-de-santiago-routes/,Camino de Santiago in Spain: 8 Most Popular Routes,Spain,"image sourceThe medieval route of pilgrims, Camino de Santiago, or the path of Saint James, has become increasingly popular in recent years. The route has been abandoned for centuries before travelers worldwide started giving it attention upon reading Paulo Coelho’s The Pilgrimage or watching The Way.For many, it’s more than a 100-kilometer hike. It’s a spiritual journey, a way to connect with the old ways, and an adventure where you can start alone and find friends along the way.Whatever it is for you, there are many ways to experience it. Here you’ll find routes that can give you a sneak peek into what Camino de Santiago is like and routes that will qualify you for the official pilgrim certificate.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Camino de Santiago short routesSt-Jean-Pied-de-Port to PamplonaSarria to Santiago de CompostelaCamino FinisterreCamino de Santiago medium routesThe Spanish part of Camino PortuguesCamino InglesCamino PrimitivoCamino de Santiago long routesCamino del NorteCamino FrancesChoosing a CaminoCamino de Santiago short routesCamino de Santiago is a spiritual goal for many. However, few people have the time to become a pilgrim in this fast-paced world. Sometimes, dropping out of the workforce for over 30 days needed to complete a longer route simply isn’t an option.Here are three short routes for people who want to walk a part of Camino de Santiago in under 5 days. But remember that you can only get the Compostela certificate for walking at least 100 kilometers.St-Jean-Pied-de-Port to PamplonaThis short route is just a small part of Camino Frances, but it can be one of the most scenery-rich ones.Duration: It takes only 5 days to walk 74 kilometers of this route. Despite it’s in the Pyrenees, it doesn’t include major uphill hikes, so you don’t need to be extra fit to finish it.Starting and finishing points: You start this route at a small beautiful town of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port. It’s a commune that stands on the river Nive. Most Camino de Frances routes come through this town, so it’s a great place to meet fellow pilgrims.Even without this fact, this medieval town is worth seeing on its own. It has a rich history that connects not only with pilgrimages but also with Richard the Lionheart and Spanish Conquest.From Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, you continue through Spanish towns of Roncesvalles and Zubiri to Pamplona.Scenery: The route takes you on a medium difficulty hike through the Pyrenees. You’ll get to see well-kept medieval towns, beautiful mountains on the border of Spain and France, and waterfalls along the way.Saint-Jean-Pied-du-Port (Source – creative commons)When to consider: It’s a great 5-day route that’s full of engaging views and doesn’t require a lot of preparation. You can easily make it in your week-long vacation.However, if you’re an advanced hiker, it may be not much of a challenge for you.Tips: Make sure you have the documents ready, as you’ll have to cross the border between Spain and France.Sarria to Santiago de CompostelaThis route is also just a section of the larger Camino de Santiago route. It’s one of the busiest sections of the pilgrim’s path, and it’s full of people, too.Duration: It’s a bit over 100 kilometers from Sarria to Santiago de Compostela. This makes this portion of the root one of the easiest ways to get an official certificate in the city.It takes 7 days to complete the route, and it doesn’t have many difficult patches.Starting and finishing points: You start this route by arriving in Sarria, a town mere 100 kilometers away from Santiago de Compostela. As you start moving westward, you will reach one small town after another, until you finally arrive at the end goal. The main key points of the journey are Portomarín, Palas de Rei, Arzúa, and Amenal.Scenery: For the majority of its duration, this path lays off the beaten track. You’ll see plenty of rural landscapes and cross several rivers along your way.When to consider: This portion of Camino de Santiago is rather busy and definitely not difficult. It’s a great opportunity to meet new people. Pilgrims who can’t do a full Camino de Santiago but want to make it to the Pilgrim’s Mass in the city can also find this route interesting.Tips: Make sure your GPS is working properly, so you don’t get lost in small towns if you lose track of pilgrim signs. Having a translator in your pocket also helps, as few locals speak English.Camino FinisterreIn the old days, people thought that the world ended in the westward part of Spain. This is why this route takes you to the end of the world, Finisterre.Duration: The route is 89 kilometers long, and it takes 5 days to complete. It won’t qualify for a certificate but is a great hike nonetheless.Starting and finishing points: While all other Camino de Santiago routes finish in Santiago de Compostela, this route starts in the city. Once there, you have to walk 60 kilometers to the small town of Hospital, and then proceed to Finisterre. The alternative way is taking another way from Hospital, and walking to Muxia.Scenery: This route takes you through beautiful hills to the seashore. It shouldn’t be difficult for most travelers. The potential for panoramic shots along the way is high enough, but once you reach the end of the world, you will be amazed by the sheer beauty of the view.When to consider: There are two kinds of people who set out to complete Camino de Finisterre. The first kind is made of people who have already walked across Spain for over 20 days, and another 5 days of the journey feels like the right thing to do. The other kind includes the people who don’t really care about the whole spirituality thing and just want a great hike that ends near the ocean.Tips: Take beachwear with you, swimming after a 5-days trip feels awesome.Camino de Santiago medium routesIf you’re an experienced traveler, you may find short routes a bit underwhelming. Especially if you were hiking in the mountains prior to taking a Camino de Santiago. Simply walking across relatively plain terrain won’t be much of a challenge for you.If that’s the case, consider these three medium difficulty routes. All of these will qualify for the Compostela certificate.The Spanish part of Camino PortuguesOriginally, this route doesn’t start in Spain. You can make Camino Portugues 100 kilometers shorter, if you cut the Porto – Oia portion, and travel in Spain only.Duration: Depending on your difficulty preferences, this route can be either 250 or 150 kilometers. The Spanish section of the route will take you up to 9 days to complete. If you want to start from Porto as the original Camino Portugues require, the whole route will take you 15 days.Starting and finishing points: If you want to follow Camino Portugues from Spain, you could start at the southernmost point of the route, A Guarda. However, it takes unnecessarily long to reach, so you can cut down to Oia instead.From that small coastal town, you’ll head to Vivo, then Pontevedra. From Pontevedra, it’s a 56-kilometer walk that will take you two days to complete.Scenery: The beauty of Camino Portugues is that you travel along the coastal line for a significant portion of the route. Once you reach Pontevedra, you’ll walk across green hills.When to consider: This portion of Camino Portugues is best suited for people who find walking across one type of terrain boring. It combines Galicia hills and beautiful seashore, so you get the best of two worlds.Tips: Hit local restaurants to taste seafood. It’s as fresh as it gets in coastal towns.Camino InglesCamino Ingles is the route English pilgrims took upon arriving in Spain from the British Isles. It’s still very convenient for the British.Duration: The route will take you up to 7 days to complete, so it’s one of the easiest medium difficulty routes. You’ll walk 119 kilometers from the coastline, which qualifies you for the certificate.Starting and finishing points: Camino Ingles starts in Ferrol, a port city in the North of Spain. From there, you head down to Pontedeume, Betanzos, and Hospital de Bruma. From Bruma, it’s only a 47-kilometer walk in almost a straight line.Traditionally, you can also start Camino Ingles from A Coruña, but that doesn’t qualify you for the certificate. Also, it’s the Ferrol – Betanzos strip that makes this route medium, not easy, difficulty.Scenery: Camino Ingles combines coastal landscapes with Galician hills just as Camino Portugues does. However, there’s a somewhat steep uphill strip close to Pontedeume that you have to be aware of.When to consider: It’s a great route if you have no problems climbing hills and want to experience both the seashore and Galicia without walking Camino Finisterre. It’s very convenient if you live in the UK as well.Tips: If you don’t want to miss A Coruña and still qualify for the pilgrim certificate, visit it first, and get to Ferrol to start the trip.Camino PrimitivoCamino Primitivo or the Original Way is the most walked path among all Caminos. It’s believed to be the oldest one, and it attracts tourists from all over the world. However, few people walk the whole path, with most of the pilgrims choosing to go only the last 100 kilometers.Duration: The original Camino Primitivo stretches across 312 kilometers. It will take you up to 16 days of walking to complete it.Starting and finishing points: This route starts at Oviedo, a picturesque town near the Cantabrian Mountains. The town itself is so great it’s worth staying for a day or two. From Oviedo, you’ll make your way to Lugo and then Santiago de Compostela.Scenery: The stretch between Oviedo and Lugo is mostly a trek across mountains. You’ll get to see lots of mountain lakes and rivers along the way. However, it requires you to quite fit because of the terrain.From Lugo, it’s mostly green Galician hills and forests, so you can relax here after the rocky part.When to consider: Consider Camino Primitivo only if you have prior experience of week-long trips across the mountains. This ensures the challenge is just right for you.Tips: Don’t rush to the route from Oviedo, take time to explore the town.Camino de Santiago long routesIf you want to fully experience what medieval pilgrims felt, or prove to yourself that you can walk for weeks straight, you have to choose the long route. It requires a lot of preparation and physical toughness, but the payoff is totally worth it.Camino del NorteCamino del Norte takes you to Santiago de Compostela along the Northern Spanish coastal line. It can be quite a challenge for novice pilgrims.Duration: The whole route is 825 kilometers long, which people who are not familiar with Camino de Santiago may find it impossible. If you’ve been on one Camino trip before, you know it’s perfectly doable. It’s just that the route will take you up to a month to complete.Starting and finishing points: You start this route at Irun, a town on the French border. From there, you march westwards along the coast, sleeping in albergues in fishing villages. At a certain point, you can join the busy Camino Primitivo to socialize or continue to walk along the coast.Scenery: In a route that’s over 800 kilometers long, there’s plenty of diversity. You’ll see everything that northern Spain has to offer. Medieval towns with a rich history, Bay of Biscay, cliffs, Cantabrian Mountains, and Galicia.When to consider: You can choose Camino del Norte if you feel like you can walk 20 kilometers per day for a whole month. You have to be fit, in good health, and willing to disappear from work for over 30 days.Tips: Pack light. There are plenty of towns on your way where you can get food and everything you need. In a month-long journey, every gram is dragging you down.A hundred grams worth of beachwear will probably only lift you up, though. There are plenty of opportunities to swim along the way.Camino FrancesCamino Frances is one of the busiest Camino de Santiago walks by far. It stretches all the way from France to Santiago de Compostela and gives you the right to earn a Compostela certificate and feel the weight of your achievement.Duration: Camino Frances is 780 kilometers long. It will take you a bit over 30 days to complete.Starting and finishing points: The route starts at St-Jean-Pied-de-Port, a small town in French Pyrenees. From there, you make your way to Pamplona, then to Sarria, which is only 100 kilometers away from Santiago de Compostela.Scenery: The French Way is for people who love lots of rural landscapes and mountains. There’s going to be a lot of that in your way. However, unlike Camino del Norte, it avoids trekking in mountains for the most part of the way, so you don’t have to be very fit to complete it.When to consider: Go for Camino Frances if you want to experience the countryside, not Bay of Biscay coast. If you want to swim in the sea, go on Camino del Norte instead. Here, you can have a dip in a river once in a couple of days, though.Tips: Don’t worry if you’re starting alone, there are plenty of people on this route and you can find friends along the way. Make sure to pack a raincoat, it may be raining even in the dry months.Choosing a CaminoWalking one of Camino de Santiago routes is a great experience, both spiritually and physically. You don’t want to ruin it by going in unprepared. Pack light, check out other travelers’ experiences and make sure your legs are in good health before you begin.Share this: "

These are both old markets, but this one was founded way earlier than Mercado de San Miguel, way back in 1882Despite its antique exterior, this market is very modern on the inside. It’s a place where you can get yourself a traditional meal or buy fresh ingredients to prepare it at home while browsing the recipe with the free Wi-fi.It is popular among locals but doesn’t have a crowd. Check it out if you want a bite of something Spanish.Picasso Museum and Hospital de Sant Pau, BarcelonaEverybody knows the best sights of Barcelona like La Sagrada de Familia, but that’s not all there is about Barcelona.  When you’re done with the cathedral, pay a visit to the Picasso Museum and Hospital de Sant Pau. A UNESCO site, this complex shows a great deal of modernism architecture and some early works of Picasso.It’s built with grandeur, and you can feel the history while you’re strolling alongside the buildings. This may not be the best place to visit on the weekend, but on the rest of the week, it’s not that crowded.Biblioteca UNED, MadridAre you a student who’s out exploring Spain? Even if you’re not, going to this UNED library may be worth it. Sure, you may just benefit from a cup of coffee and an interesting book in a silent place. But there’s more to this library than you think.It’s situated in a historical building with brick walls and great looking vaults. The hanging lights make the main hall look like Hogwarts.Since it’s a historical building, this library is now closed for renovation. If by the time you’re in Madrid it’s open, definitely go there. If it’s not, you can try Biblioteca Central de la UNED Madrid.It belongs to the same university, and the design is similar.Casa de Campo, MadridIf you’re visiting the library from the previous point, drop by this park as well. It’s close to the central UNED library and is a great place to spend the hot hours of midday.This park used to be royal hunting grounds. Now, it’s a huge public park with a lake inside of it. The view from the inside kind of looks like Central Park in NYC – skyscrapers are towering above the trees.You can rent a boat to paddle along the lake, visit a Zoo that connects Casa de Campo to West Park, or visit one of the many sports facilities there. If that’s not your cup of tea, you can always hide from the sun strolling amidst the trees.Castillo de Butrón, Basque CountryIf you liked being alone in the woods in Casa de Campo, you may be completely thrilled by this one. Castillo de Butrón is a medieval castle situated in Basque Country, not far from the warm waters of Bay of Biscay.This Bavarian-styled giant is not medieval by the standards of architecture. However, it looks exactly like you imagine a medieval castle. The look of this gray castletowering above the green of the forest reminds of a fairytale.The walk around the premises is also worth it.Gaztelugatxe, Basque CountryDid someone sneeze? Nope, this is a name of an islet in the Bay of Biscay waters. It’s a small islet with a church. How do people get there?That’s the biggest part of why this piece of Spanish land made the list in the first place. Gaztelugatxe is connected to the mainland by a beautiful man-made bridge. It’s so zig-zag and erratic that it easily could have been natural!The place has no hype about it, and you can have it pretty much to your own on most days. After you pass through the bridge, hike around the hills of the islet.El Tamboril / the Mariscal, SevilleIf you happen to pass through Seville, this bar is the best place to end your evening. It’s so small it’s not even on TripAdvisor! Previously, you had to find the place hidden behind the green. Now, they moved to the Mariscal, a bar close to the original place.This bar hosts true flamenco artists. Not the ones that earn their living dancing flamenco at restaurants, rather, Mariscal invites in the locals that are passionate about flamenco.You can add cheap drinks and tapas to your list as well.Rural de Anaga Park, TenerifeAre you going to visit Tenerife? We have a tip just for you!Laying on the ebony beach and swimming all day is fun, but what if you spice it up with a walk? Rural de Anaga Park is situated on the Eastern end of the island and offers you a unique atmosphere.Unlike the beaches of Tenerife that are lit with sun, this park constantly in shade from the trees with wide branches. The place looks like Pan’s Labyrinth!Calella de Palafrugell, SpainWhile the crowds of tourist go down to enjoy the beach at Malaga there are lots of other lesser known coastal destinations in Spain. One such town is the charming Calella de Palafrugell in Costa Brava north of Barcelona. It has a small beach dotted with small fishing boats and charming houses with a Cuban style from Spaniards who moved to Cuba and then back to Spain. For a nice stroll hike to near by Llafranc long the coast.ExtremaduraThe Extremadura Region of Spain is one of the lesser visited regions in the country, yet it is also the one with perhaps the most history. Located north of Andalucia, east of Portugal, and west of Madrid, it has never gotten the attention which other regions of Spain have gotten. It is too bad because some of the most important historical events in the history of Spain happened here.The city of Merida was one of the most Roman settlements in the Iberian Peninsula and the Roman Ruins of Merida are some of the best you can find in the world.In the village of Guadalupe, you will find the Monastery of Guadalupe, which was where Columbus first met Queen Isabella and where the first people in the new world were brought back to Europe. It was also the first place in Europe were new world crops such as potatoes were planted.The Town of Caceres has an ancient history and was a major city in the region during the Moorish Conquest, and later expanded after the Reconquista. It too was an important city in the planning, exploration, and conquest of the New World. You can still see Arabic text on the walls of the old city, and there is a preserved Jewish Quarter which is one of the best pre-Inquisition Jewish Quarters left in Spain.The city of Trujillo was the home to many Conquistadors, who as second sons, left to find fame and fortune in the New World. Former residents of Trujillo include Pizarro and Cortez.Off the beaten path As weird as this may sound, you can’t find all the tiny places full of local culture on the internet. You can probably achieve better results if you know Spanish, but ultimately, you’ll have to go out on your own and explore.Spain is an interesting place (40+ Interesting and Fun Facts About Spain) but it would wrong to assume that the most interesting parts are the places getting all the tourism. The best places are not popular. We found a good part of the ones you see in the list by simply stumbling upon them.So, if you want the ultimate advice on what should you see in Spain, here it goes. You should see whatever you come across. Rent a car and go out in the wilderness. Take a turn from the street crowded with tourists. It’s there that the true Spanish culture and the true adventure is. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/36-hours-granada/,"36 Hours in Granada, Spain",Spain,"Without a doubt, Granada’s biggest attraction has to be the Alhambra palace and gardens. Built by Granada’s Nasrid rulers in the 13th and 14th centuries, the Alhambra is one of the most visited sights in Spain attracting 6,000 visitors per day.Because of the need to see what is undoubtedly the finest example of Islamic architecture in Europe, the city of Granada is often overlooked with tour operators used to shuttling visitors to the Alhambra and nothing else. Even spending only one extra day (36 hours total) in Granada will increase the value of your trip.What visitors miss is the chance to explore a compelling city where horseshoe-shaped arches and the tea houses of the old Arab quarter mix effortlessly with the tapas bars, student dives, and the flamenco clubs.Thanks in part to a large student population; Granada’s streets have an energy about them that you will not find in any other Spanish city except for Salamanca.A visit to Granada will also give you the opportunity to sample the region’s distinct food which, while on the face of it may appear to be typically Spanish has its roots in North Africa.Wander Granada’s Albaicín neighborhoodSimilar to a Middle Eastern souk or a Medina in Morocco, the Albaicín in Granada is a magical place of winding streets high above the Daro River. Full of white-washed houses, bars, restaurants, and shops selling brightly colored lanterns, the walk to the Church of San Nicolas at the top of the hill is worth it for the view alone. Even at 10:00 or 11 pm in the evening, you will meet groups of happy folk on tours and couples meandering their way up to the top to the San Nicolas square which is a most pleasant experience.A view you will never forgetSet against the dark Sierra Nevada Mountains the stunning view of the Alhambra is particularly special at sunset and the best place in Granada to capture that picture-perfect photo of the red palace.Tip – Check the time the sun is setting so that you don’t have to wait too long for your photo and then wait for the Alhambra to be lit up for another memorable photograph.Visit the birthplace of the FlamencoFirst settled by Gypsies after the conquest of the city by Christian armies in 1492 the Sacromonte district of the city is considered to be the birthplace of flamenco. When the Roma or Gitanos, as they are referred to in Spain arrived in Granada in the 15th century they lived in caves above the river. These caves today are now bars and clubs where you can witness authentic, passionate flamenco in its truest form.Tip – Don’t buy a ticket for a flamenco show from your hotel or a ticket outlet. All the flamenco bars are located on Sacromonte’s main street, so go in the evening and scope the place out for yourself. Throughout the summer, you may even catch a small flavor of flamenco out in the open as talented artists perform to passing crowds.The Alhambra in GranadaWe could not visit Granada without seeing the Alhambra and have to admit it certainly was the highlight of our weekend. Decorated in such a unique style of Islamic geometric design and lettering the Alhambra is a world wonder that should be on everyone’s bucket list.The Alhambra itself collectively includes five main parts, three of these are open all day of your visit, yet the Nasrid palaces, the real gems of your trip, are only available to be seen during the time marked on your entrance ticket. The Alhambra is a maze of real wonders to be discovered. As you encounter a different courtyard with every turn, you can almost imagine conversations that took place centuries ago on the very spot you are standing. The attractive and serene gardens enhance the magnificent palaces in every way imaginable. The ambiance created by the fountains trickling water creates a wonderful feeling of intrigue yet tranquility.Tip – Pay for the audio tour! Not only does it explain all the features of the complex, but it also tells you what life was like during the periods of its construction.Be sure and book your ticket as far in advance as possible as just turning up and hoping to get in is not an option. You can also save time by booking a skip the line tour.Where to stay in GranadaIn order to be able to explore Granada on foot stick to accommodation in the city center as all the main places of interest are either there or in the adjacent Albaicín and Sacromonte neighborhoods.Tip – You are going to do a lot of walking so make sure your shoes are comfortable and up for the job.Food & DrinkThe local beer in Granada is of course called Alhambra and comes with a tasty tapa. In most bars, it is usually a nice surprise as to what tapa you will get, but the waiters try and remember what you already had so that you don’t get the same food twice.You can, of course, pay for additional tapas or larger portions and eat cheaply while enjoying a few beers or a glass of wine. However, unlike tapas on the coast of Southern Spain, tapas in Granada can be huge.Tip – For the best tapas in town hit the bars along Calle Navas and choose a place you like the look of.Transport optionsGranada Airport (GRX) is mainly used for domestic flights but does now have regular flights on Easyjet from Gatwick and Manchester.Tip – To get to Granada from other airports in the UK you can fly to Malaga Airport on Spain’s sunny Costa del Sol. From Malaga, you can catch a bus to Granada from the airport with the Alsa bus company. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/san-sebastian-spain/,"The Exquisite Beauty of San Sebastian, Spain",Spain,"Image source: PixabayArratsalde on!  This means ‘good afternoon’ in Basque, one of the languages spoken in Donostia (San Sebastian), one of the most picturesque cities in Spain. Founded in 1180, the city of San Sebastian spans over 60 square kilometers and a population of 186,000 inhabitants and lies on the southern coast of the Biscay Bay. Each year, tens of thousands of tourists flood the city in an attempt to take home something of its beauty, for this jewel has always been trapped between two worlds – splendid Spain and the region’s desire to obtain autonomy. Albeit impossible, in this article, we will try to paint you a picture of Donostia – its people, its winding streets, and history-laden monuments.San Sebastian at a Glance The FoodDid you know that the city of San Sebastian has the highest Michelin score per capita? For those of you who are interested in savoring the culinary delights of Donostia, the city has seven world-renowned restaurants, totaling 12 Michelin stars. The cities signature dishes include dried and salt cod, cococha (fish jaws), Idiazabal cheese (pressed cheese made exclusively from unpasteurized sheep milk), and, of course, the pincho (quick snack, usually served in bars, that includes hake, anchovy, tortillas, peppers, and croquettes).The CultureGreat food is not the only thing Donostia has to offer. For those of you who are in love with the big screen, you might want to postpone your trip for September for the San Sebastian International Film Festival. With a tradition that goes back to the early 50s, many famous actors and actresses have walked across the red carpet. To name just a couple of them – Catherine Deneuve, Harrison Ford, Anthony Quin, Kirk Douglass, Max von Sydow, Charlize Theron, and Monica Bellucci. For those of you with cultural inclinations, the San Telmo Museum dedicate to Basque history and culture has a vast collection of art elements (over 20,000). Ayuntamiento or the City Hall is a feast for the eyes. Built in the late 19th century, this building used to be a casino and a place of refuge for spies (Mata Hari) and political misfits during the First World War. San Sebastian BeachesConsidering R&R, San Sebastian touts some of the most amazing beaches in the world. La Concha beach lies a stone throws away from the Old Town and, of course, from the Miramar Palace. This exquisite beach has been attracting tourists since the 19th century. And for good reasons too. During her reign, Regent Queen Maria Cristina was so in love with this stretch of land that she did her best to transform it into something truly unique. And so, by the turn of the century, San Sebastian had been declared the summer capital of Europe.  The other two beaches are called Ondarretta, which is the smallest and a popular destination among Basque families, and Zurriola beach, which attracts surfers and divers. Donostia – The Place Where Stories Intertwine with Real LifeBeyond history-laden promenades, memories of decorations paraded during glamorous parties, and moon-lit beaches, Donostia is the sort of place haunted by romantic stories, shaped and reshaped by fancy, by impression, by what we leave behind and take with us. Anywhere you go, the sea calls out to you. And let me tell you, it’s a sight to behold – roaring waves that whoosh as they go past the boat and the ever-growing silence, sans the low rumble of the boat’s engine. It’s a thrill to look out the window and see that Oxford blue sea stretching as far as the eye can see. The romantic fancy cannot stand idly by as the coast, sky, and sea clash as if they were part of Turner’s arrangements. Image source: Creative Photo ConnectThe cruise was short and sweet. But, then again, everything in life should stay that way. Otherwise, we would forget how to savor these moments. One of the best things about these cruises is that some of the locals insist on conducting them shortly before dusk. And, as you can see, for a very good reason – the dying light makes everything look even more enchanted. Once you get ashore, you have this gizzy feeling inside of you, as though something’s missing, something that was always there but you simply didn’t know about it. Not to worry, because there’s always a room with a view, as the novel goes. The hotel where I stayed was smack on the seashore. If you want to get an idea of how close the hotel was to the sea sometimes, at night, when the winds were howling, I had to close my window as the floor kept getting wet. But the neighborhood was still a sight to behold – old family businesses that entreated clients with various local delicacies, bookstores, antiquaries, all of them arranged as to form the outline of a falcon’s head. The best thing about the place I stayed at was that you could choose your scenery. The front window opened up to the sea, while the other one had a lovely view of the city and the mountains. Image source: Creative Photo ConnectSan Sebastian is the kind of city that somehow manages to retain your interest even if you’ve seen it a thousand times. Even a casual stroll along a boulevard can surprise. While exploring Boulevard Avenue, my attention was caught be the most peculiar thing imaginable – an automobile so quaint, that you simply couldn’t have missed it. Still, it felt like it belonged there, like a long-lost relative whom you haven’t seen since childhood. Like most San Sebastian streets, Boulevard Avenue is riddled with history – the cobblestone that retains the echo of horse-drawn carriages, remnants of fortifications.  So, it’s no wonder to see such sights while wandering the city. The sight in question took me back to the early 20s, more specifically – fancy cars, glamorous parties, the never-ending spin of the roulette.  I have to say that it was a breath of fresh air after that classic was clashing with modern. There’s a story to be told here. Unfortunately, the author was in such a hurry to run the red light that I didn’t have a chance to ask him anything. On the bright side, the picture itself says more than words ever can. Backtracking a bit, because memory works in mysterious ways, remember Biscay Bay and the cruise? Well, even though dusk is the best time to witness the beauty of San Sebastian, the so-called afternoon delights are also a sight to behold. During one of these trips, our guide, who was a fisherman, took us around the bay to witness the beauty, the ‘splendor’ he called it, of having one of the oldest jobs in the world. It was a thrill to witness the fishing boats throwing their nets in the water and waiting. There was something very peaceful about this panorama like even though the boats were moving, everything was so still. ‘Twas a picture out of Kazantzakis’ novels, minus the Mediterranean allure. Image source: Creative Photo ConnectThe Sad Tale of an Antique BikeNow that our little intermezzo is over, I need to share with you one of the most heartbreaking tales I happened to come upon while wandering the streets of Donostia. Between Lasala Square and Plaza de la Constitucion, there’s a narrow street called Enbeltran. There’s nothing special about this stretch of road – an old building in desperate needs of repairs, a couple of shops, and a cafe. However, at the far end of the street, where Enbeltran meets San Juan, there’s a two-story house with a flight of stairs and a corroded metal rail.Resting near the stairs, there’s a rusty old bike secured with a big padlock to the rail. Now, for the unaware tourist, this would get labeled as a curiosity and nothing more. However, there’s more to the bike story. It’s entire demeanor led me to inquire of a shop owner about it. The story itself is tear-jerking, to say the least.So, as the tale goes, that bike has been sitting in the same place for the past seven decades. Apparently, it belonged to a postman named Abarran, who, during the Second World War, used to deliver letters to the wives and mothers expecting news from their loved ones. Sometime during the last year of the war, Abarran got drafted.Before he left, he asked Ximenia, his wife, to take care of the house and his bike during his absence. Mrs. Ximenia knew how fond her husband was off the bike and diligently took care of it. Each day, she could be seen standing next to the bike, picturing how her husband would come home and start doing his morning rounds. One day, Ximenia received a letter from the Army, informing her of her husband’s death. Heartbroken, the widow refused to acknowledge that her husband passed away on some distant battlefield, continued to wait for his return. Until she passed away in the early 90s, she kept a vigil near Abarran’s bike.More than that convinced that her husband could be back anytime, she asked the local mechanic to keep the bike in working order. Still, since Abarran’s death, the bike has was never moved. People sometimes come to this place to hear the story of Ximena and to see the antique bike. Image source: Creative Photo ConnectMy journey ended in the far north, near the slopes of Monte Urgull. There, perched on top are the ruins of a naval fort. Although in ruins, the fort still has a couple of cannons aimed towards the sea, as though to repel an armada. The evening was a little cloudy, but that didn’t deter me from snapping an awesome picture of the moon. And that, my friends, is the end of a marvelous holiday. Image source: Creative Photo ConnectConclusion San Sebastian is definitely the city of stories. Anywhere you go, you’re bound to stumble upon great stories. The city itself, always seems to be hanging between the old and the new. So, what are you waiting for?

https://amateurtraveler.com/ronda-spain/,The Best Things to do in Ronda Spain,Spain,"Most people visiting Southern Spain head for the popular cities of Granada, Seville or Cordoba and it’s no wonder as those places are abundant with Spanish culture and its colorful history.  But for sheer drama, it’s hard to beat Ronda. This delightful village perches precariously overlooking El Tajo gorge and is a longstanding favorite of so many visitors to southern Spain. Here’s why you must include Ronda next time you visit Spanish soil and what you should do there.Wander the cobblestones of the old townBegin at Ronda’s 16th-century convent, now an art museum, and fan out into the neighboring streets lined with mansions built by Ronda’s wealthy nobility.  Step inside the Casa de Don Bosco and admire its roofed patio. Palacio Mondragón is arguably the shiniest jewel in a richly studded crown, its beautiful water gardens a reminder that it was once a Moorish palace.Nearby you’ll find the charming Plaza Duquesa de Parcent; don’t miss the church of Santa Maria de Mayor with its attractive bell tower.Also worth a mention is the Minaret of San Sebastián. Once part of a mosque, later a church, the minaret survives though the rest of the building has long gone. Surprisingly, when the church was completely destroyed in the 1600s due to the Morisco uprisings or the revolt against the Castilian Crown, rumor has it that the minaret was intentionally left remaining as a constant reminder to the people of what they had since lost. This famous building was declared a national monument of historic importance in 1931 and its intriguing tower is a commonly photographed historical landmark as you will observe.A view you will never forgetLike every other visitor, you’re going to want to walk out across the Puente Nuevo, the bridge which straddles the chasm separating the old town and the new. Despite its name, it actually dates from the late 18th century – even “nuevo” is pretty ancient in these parts.  It’s Ronda encapsulated; the bridge features in every brochure and is the iconic image of the town. Peering down to the bottom of the canyon or across to the whitewashed houses that characterize this part of Spain is a must. But once you’re done, hike downhill and gaze up at the bridge itself – now that’s a splendid view. Almost 100 meters tall, this impressive structure creates the most awe-inspiring backdrop to any photograph.For some of the best views in the city, consider a stay in the old city hall, Parador de Ronda, which is one the edge of the cliff. It is the building to the left in the photo at the top of the page.Picnic in Ronda’s green lungThe trouble with living at the edge of a precipice is that you don’t really get a garden of your own. No matter, when the town’s own garden is the wonderful green space of the Alameda del Tajo. This pretty little park was designed with the idea of providing somewhere for locals without gardens to get much-needed space and relax. These days it particularly comes alive on summer weekends, when tourists and locals alike flock to its shady trees and soothing fountains to seek solace from the heat of the sun. Just a little further stroll along the park’s path, you’ll reach a fantastic ‘mirador’ or viewpoint with expansive views deep into the valley and plain. Even in inclement weather, the views down to the valley is a memory you will never forget, though you’ll prefer the clearer views if you choose to avoid the winter months. Once you’ve strolled beside its rose-entwined pergolas, settle down and enjoy one of southern Spain’s best sunset spots.Visit one of Spain’s famous bathsYou’ll find Baños Arabes, Spain’s hammams, all over Andalusia and no visit is complete unless you’ve tried one.  Since Moorish times, people have come to the baths mainly for health reasons; to sweat out toxins and impurities in the hot steam.  Ronda’s were constructed underground in the 11th or 12th century and featured a combination of hot, warm and cool rooms.  Though the baths here no longer function as a pool, they’re open as a museum – and after a visit here you’ll be sure to want to find working baths elsewhere in Andalusia.BullfightingRonda is also well known for its long tradition of bullfighting. In fact, the Plaza de Toros in Ronda continues to hold a special place in modern Spanish culture and history. Although the practice of bullfighting is what some would consider a controversial topic, the building itself is somewhat of an architectural masterpiece. It is the oldest bullring constructed entirely of stone, with an incredible 136 Tuscan sandstone columns forming 68 spectacular arches, which is still considered a great ambitious project of its era.Time your visit for the Feria Goyesca in September for a colorful, albeit challenging, experience.  The bullring is a museum for those who prefer not to watch the action.  If you’re planning to visit Spain, you won’t want to miss Ronda whatever time of year you come although we thoroughly recommend photographing the most spectacular views it has to offer during summer and late spring.Transport options. The easiest ways to get to Ronda from MalagaGetting to Ronda from Malaga airport is now easier than it once was with a network of public transport & private hire options.Rental CarIf you bring a rental car you will not need it in Ronda which is pretty small. You can park your car under the Plaza del Socorro in the new part of town.Taxi from Malaga airport to RondaMalaga airport taxis can be booked online in advance without having to pay anything upfront at www.malagaairporttaxi.net.Public bus from Malaga airport to Ronda  Although there is still no direct bus from Malaga to Ronda, there is the option to take one to Marbella, and transfer to another bus at Marbella bus station to Ronda. You will find the bus stop in easy reach just outside arrivals at Malaga airport. One word of wisdom, Keep your ticket just in case you need to transfer to another bus.

https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,Spain,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "

Not only is Spain filled with beautiful beaches and popular hotspots, it is also a very cheap destination for students who don’t have a lot of money to spend.If you wish to have a nice holiday that won’t cost you the world, Spain is a great option for you. Here are some of the best Spanish destinations for students for this year that are bound to help you stay on your budget.Marbella, Costa del SolLocated at the south of Spain, Costa del Sol or “Coast of the Sun” is one of the most beautiful regions Spain has to offer. It is a world-renowned tourist destination. Marbella is situated on the Mediterranean Sea and offers some of the best beaches and beach clubs. The beaches are quite clean, and when I visited was the first time I enjoyed sunbathing.With its Moorish defensive walls the city has a great archaeological heritage. Most of the old buildings can be found in the Old Town (Casco Antiguo), which was built after the reconquest. The city offers resorts and activities for all budgets and you are bound to find something that can cover your needs. I took a cheap hostel that cost me $30 per night.Ayamonte, Costa de la LuzLocated near the Guadiana River, Ayamonte is a town near the borders with Portugal. While staying there, you can easily, and for a very low cost, take the ferry to Portugal to explore the Portuguese Vila Real de Santo Antonio. The price of a ferry is only 1.75 euros, extremely cheap, and totally worth it. I do not know why the local authorities do not raise the price, as this ferry route is quite popular, and definitely worth it.The town has only 20 thousand residents. Ayamonte is a great option for students on a budget as you can find accommodation for as little as 30 dollars per night. I took a hostel here as well: quite comfortable and as hospitable as any Spanish locality.CantabriaWould you like to visit national parks filled with wildlife, go surfing in gorgeous beaches or even go climbing? If you love adventure then Cantabria is the place for you. I actually visited on the road to Madrid, and did not have enough time to take a closer look at the whole place, but all the activities are affordable and very close to the capital and you can definitely have a great time there while still staying on your budget.Tamariu, Costa BravaTamariu is a great place for you to choose, especially if you’d like to find cheap accommodation right by the beach through Airbnb (which I took, only $20 per night).

Being very close to Barcelona, Tamariu is a great place for you to take a break from your studies and enjoy the natural habitat and medieval villages without spending too much on your stay.Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary IslandsIf you’re looking for the place with the best nightlife, then Santa Cruz should definitely be your pick. There are so many options to choose from and you will definitely find places that are more budget friendly.

https://amateurtraveler.com/touring-el-raval-in-barcelona/,Touring El Raval in Barcelona,Spain,"After our first day in Barcelona,  I was falling in love with this Spanish city. Over the course of five days, we visited every major site in Barcelona and had hundreds of pictures to prove it. On our last day, we were ready to get beyond the most popular sites and see one of the Barcelona neighborhoods not as well known by tourists: El Raval.All cities have their affluent sections which tell one story, but they also have their grittier, poorer sections that tell quite another. In Barcelona, El Raval is a grittier section with a reputation for crime, prostitution, and drugs.To help guide us in our exploration we opted for an audio tour offered through an app called Detour. This company prides itself on offering unique city tours and unusual narrators. Our El Raval narrator was Ben Brooks, a young, English author who has lived in the area for several years. He used his own experiences combined with those of two other El Raval authors, Jean Genet and Roberto Bolano, to recount the area’s history for the past century.El Raval or the Raval is next to the busiest and most touristy area in Barcelona called Las Ramblas. The contrast between these two sections is fairly stunning. We walked one block west from Las Ramblas and found ourselves in front of a condemned apartment building that is fully occupied by squatters. Next to this building are the ruins of a famous brothel. On the other side of the street is a former bath house built during the Napoleonic era as a result of the residents’ poor hygiene habits.The audio tour guided us a bit further down the same road to the oldest bar in Barcelona, Bar Marsella. This establishment is famous both for its serving of absinthe as well as its clientele of authors and artists like Hemingway, Picasso, and Gaudi. The square across from the bar has a history of attracting drug dealers and their clients. One block in the opposite direction is a non-profit organization serving the homeless in the area with food and clothing. Needless to say, this is not a part of town I’d recommend visiting after dark and I was thankful to have Jason with me for this tour. It’s also an area popular with pickpockets, so we kept a close eye on our valuables.To focus only on the darkest part of the Raval would be unfair and our audio tour did a nice job of presenting a balance. Like the grittier sections of most cities, this area is more affordable and therefore attractive to recent immigrants. Overall Barcelona boasts a diverse population, but nowhere in the city is that more apparent than in the Raval where there are a wide variety of ethnic stores, markets, and restaurants. As a result, the popularity of dining and shopping in this area is growing for both locals and visitors.Hospital de la Santa CreuIn recent years the city government of Barcelona has tried to “clean-up” this part of town through crime reduction efforts and economic development. So far it appears to be working. The second part of our tour took us to the less seedy part of the area where it’s easy to find boutique hotels, hip coffee shops, and trendy shops. At one time the hospital for the poor, Hospital de la Santa Creu, was located in The Raval. After closing and falling into disrepair it has since been renovated and now serves as the home for several libraries as well as the Institute of Catalan Studies.Palau GuellAlongside its history of crime, prostitution, and drugs, the Raval has simultaneously been a hotbed for art and artists in Barcelona. Artists found this area to be both more affordable and more tolerant. The French author and poet, Jean Genet, spent many years here since as a gay man he was ostracized in his home country as well as other parts of Barcelona. One of Gaudi’s first commissions, Palau Guell, is located in the Raval, just bordering Las Ramblas. In 1995 the Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona opened here and more recently was joined by the film archive, FilmoTeca Catalunya.Boutique Hotel in El RavalExploring the Raval through our Detour app took about two hours and significantly expanded our understanding of Barcelona. The poor, recently arrived, less conventional and artistic citizens of the city often chose (or were forced) to live and work here. Despite its small size, the Raval has had an outsized influence on the rest of the city. From here immigrants became established and successful and moved to other areas. Some of the artists and authors became household names throughout Spain and beyond. And more recently locals and visitors are discovering its unique history and culture.We began our week with a tour of the Gothic Quarter and visiting some of the best-known sites in Barcelona. These are the sites on which guidebooks and Facebook photos are based. We ended with a fascinating tour of El Raval which allowed us to learn about the lesser-known sites and their sometimes dark history. The combination provided us a more balanced and nuanced understanding of one of the world’s great cities.Editor: For another day trip idea from Barcelona consider a day trip to Montserrat.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/discovering-south-america-tenerife/,Discovering South America on Tenerife,Spain,"We emerge from the protective pine forest canopy into full sunshine, stepping aside to allow caballeros (horsemen) to pass. Horses are still a common mode of transport in the upper La Orotava Valley on Tenerife. Ahead, a narrow path through an explosive display of wildflowers leads the way. Above the pines, the immense bulk of Spain’s highest mountain, the dozing volcano Mount Teide, hogs the scenic limelight. To the side of the path are agricultural terraces. In each, families the size of a small armies pull at emerald plants. We stop to ask a farmer what they’re harvesting.“Patatas,” he replies, followed by an invite to join the harvesters. Within minutes we’ve swapped our hike for a fiesta in a field amongst four generations of potato pickers. Plastic cups are thrust into our hands and filled with an earthy and extremely drinkable vino del pais (country wine). My friend beams and looks around, slightly awestruck. It’s not the Tenerife he expected.“This doesn’t feel like Spain,” he murmurs. “This feels like South America.”This feels like South America. It’s not the first time that a well-traveled visitor has come out with this statement and it won’t be the last.It’s no surprise. Tenerife and the Canary Islands have been connected to South America since Christopher Columbus passed through on his way to discover the Americas.He didn’t stop at Tenerife in 1492. The natives were revolting and the volcano was blowing its top; not the most inviting of locations to top up supplies and the suntan.Tenerife was conquered four years later and ports were built as the island lay at the crossroads between Europe and the New World. In the 500 plus years since, links between Tenerife and South America have grown ever stronger, influencing culture, food, music, and the landscape.The Jardín de Aclimatación in the La Paz area of Puerto de la Cruz is a shrine to exotic flora from the New World. It was established in the 18th century as a halfway house between South America and Spain for plants destined for the court of King Carlos III. Mainland Spain’s climate proved too harsh for the plants, so many were left to flourish on Tenerife. The gardens house over 5000 specimens including a colossal 200-year-old Higuera.However, it’s people who have had the greatest impact. Throughout Tenerife’s history, there have been boom and bust periods. In times of hardship, the islanders headed west to South America. When these ‘Indianos’ made their fortune, they returned to their homeland bringing money as well as a taste for Latino food and music.Like the rest of Spain, Tinerfeños (Tenerife islanders) are fiesta junkies, with the biggest celebration of the year being ‘Carnaval’ during February/March. Some say carnival celebrations in Tenerife’s capital, Santa Cruz, are second only to Rio de Janeiro’s. Maybe, maybe not. Tenerife tourism will help you get there and judge for yourself. What is a fact is that up to 100,000 revelers salsa and merengue throughout the night at carnival street parties where the thumping sounds that fuel the party are Latino and reggaeton – a Latin/reggae/hip-hop fusion. It’s not just carnival, every fiesta comes with a hip-swiveling, South American soundtrack.My introduction to South America’s culinary influence took place at a no-frills café in La Laguna, a UNESCO World Heritage Site whose revolutionary grid layout was the blueprint for a number of South American cities.When I ordered a bocadillo (filled baguette) the waiter refused, suggesting I try something called an arepa. These grilled or fried Venezuelan cornflour flatbreads filled with spicy beef or chicken, mayo and avocado were a revelation and, at a couple of Euros each, very cheap. Since then I’ve tested arepas across Tenerife, my current favorite is from a kiosk in Santiago del Teide; a town with the look of a Mexican pueblo.As well as Venezuelan, there are Argentinian and Peruvian restaurants. Recently I had my first taste of Chilean tapas at Arlequin, a great little joint in the coastal town of Playa San Juan.Possibly the most intense experience for anyone seeking a South American hit is found at Azucar in Puerto de la Cruz. The former colonial gentlemen’s club is a steamy Cuban bar in a colonial building where more-ish mojitos flow till 3 am and beyond, and the clientèle put on sensual displays of hip-grinding salsa that is almost voyeuristic to watch. The first visit to the bar can be quite intimidating, but after a couple of hours, with a few mojitos notched up, it will be pushing for the number one spot of your favorite bars around the world.One night at Azucar should be enough to convince any visitor that Tenerife may be a Spanish island near the coast of Africa, but the beat it sways sexily to is unmistakably South American. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/what-to-do-in-malaga-spain/,"What to Do in Malaga, Spain",Spain,"My Málaga FavoritesAfter living in Andalusia for a number of years I’ve become very accustomed to where I live almost totally forgetting at times that I’m in a country that isn’t my own. Despite this, the city of Málaga continues to surprise and charm me each time I visit. There’s something about the combination of the Andalusian people, the mix of Christian and Muslim history and the location that really brings this place to life. Every Spanish city has its own characteristics but Málaga is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, so I thought I’d share a few of my favorite haunts in the city for anybody who plans on visiting in the near future.Castillo de GibralfaroThe Gibralfaro Castle is an ancient fortress that dates from the 10th century which played an important role in the reconquering of Andalusia by the Catholic Kings, removing the Muslim Nasrid dynasty from power. It has fabulous views over the city and port, positioned overlooking Málaga on the hills to the northeast of the old town. It’s an island of tranquillity in an otherwise bustling city but amazingly is only a few minutes from the prettiest parts of Málaga. It’s one of two fortresses in the city, the other being the Alcazaba of Málaga, although El Castillo de Gibralfaro is definitely my favorite. The castle is protected as a national park, with beautiful gardens and during the summer months is frequently used as a venue for musical performances by Classical, Ethnic and Jazz groups.El Pedregalejo PromenadeThe area known as El Pedregalejo is a neighborhood in Málaga about 10 minutes by car from the center on the Eastern edge of the city. The area itself is not particularly attractive however its beach promenade is the perfect blend of international and local but without the tacky touristy feel. It’s quite a young area due to the high number of language schools in the neighborhood behind but has a little bit of everything with very traditional family chiringuitos and laid back beach bars next door to each other. It’s also further away from the port compared to other beaches in Málaga which means you get an often fascinating view to watch while you sunbathe without the icky feeling of dirty seawater. The beach area is divided up into a number of manmade horseshoe coves and during the summer evenings offers picturesque sunsets with a lively atmosphere.Museum of Art and Popular CustomsThis quirky little museum was first suggested to me by a friend from Málaga whilst he tried to describe to me a typical bottle used to keep water cool in summer (a Botijo if you’re interested). He said that I should take a look if I wanted to learn more about the region and these kinds of typical things. I found an immaculate little hidden gem, well off the beaten tourist track in a building (once a 17th-century inn) that on its own was worth a visit. It only costs two Euros to enter and although it may not be the busiest of museums, you’ll learn a lot about life in Málaga over the past one hundred years as well as seeing a side to the region that most tourists never get to know.El PimpiMy final place in Málaga is one of the oldest bodegas (wineries) in the city and comes with bags of character and tradition. El Pimpi is a bar/restaurant found opposite the Roman amphitheater at the foot of the Alcazaba. It’s popular with tourists and locals although bear in mind that the Spanish tend to run on a different schedule than the rest of us. For me, El Pimpi is all about the atmosphere. The buzz that you’ll find here on a night may well be down to the local sweet wine which in summer when chilled is all too easy to drink or it may be due to the labyrinth of separate rooms which I found fascinating on my first visit. El Pimpi has a very traditional style with rooms decorated with barrels signed by lots of famous visitors. Many of these visitors are national celebrities although you may see a few you recognize such as John Malkovich, Placido Domingo, Sean Connery and local boy Antonio Banderas.The truth is that I could go on with all sorts of tapas bars and quirky little places that I’ve found but this is more of a work in progress than a definitive list. I’ll continue to explore and enjoy Málaga. Hopefully, this little list will send you well on the way to loving it as I do.Where to StayBooking.com    (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js'); Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/wet-and-wild-in-tenerife/,Tenerife Water Parks and Water Sports,Spain,"Tenerife: a rugged outcrop of volcanic wonder; a paradise of exotic flora. Or perhaps more appropriately, a simple four-hour flight from the murky British winter. Today, we’re in the mood for the latter, wishing we could be soaking up the sun at any one of Tenerife’s top watery landmarks.Siam ParkNot just the best waterpark in Tenerife, but also “the most spectacular in Europe”, if the hype is to be believed. This Thai-themed park is built on a natural incline, meaning that its rides (of which there are more than 10) are naturally supported. For reasons such as this, Siam Park considers itself the world’s first eco-friendly waterparks (it runs its own desalination plant and recycles all its own water). On a less academic note, it is home to the world’s biggest manmade wave, swelling to a gnarly three meters in height. Surf’s definitely up!Aqualand Costa AdejeA little less ostentatious, perhaps, than Siam Park, the big attraction at Aqualand Costa Adeje is undoubtedly the dolphinarium – and birthday boys and girls can even book themselves in for a wet and wonderful dolphin kiss, all of which will be caught on film for you to take home. The water slides themselves are divided between themed zones, meaning that thrill-seekers can whoop to their hearts’ content without scaring the kids in the family area.Lago MartiánezLocated to the North East of Puerto De La Cruz, Lago Martiánez is a vast swimming resort boasting four pools, a central lake, cascading waterfalls, submerged caves, a spa and – to top it all – a submerged casino. Best of all is the price – a mere €3.50 for the full day. The complex also features a selection of restaurants, so it’s perfectly possible to spend the full day here without needing to leave.Whale watchingCombining the awe with the aqua, Tenerife is rightly recognized as being one of the world’s best whale-watching destinations, and countless guides and tours set out daily, determined to show off these graceful giants. If you’re unsure who to go with, several companies offer your money back if you fail to see a whale, so shop around before you look to set sail. Oh, and don’t forget to pack your swimming costume and snorkel – you wouldn’t want to miss the chance to swim with a dolphin, now, would you?Water sportsThe pristine waters that lap at the shores of the Canary Islands are a playground of sorts, there for you to explore. Beneath the surface, the volcanic rock and countless shipwrecks make Tenerife an ideal diving destination, if you like your holidays submerged; high above, you can make the sky your own with a spot of parascending. Banana boats and jet skis are also common (although not terribly wildlife-friendly), and most companies offer a menu from which you can pick and choose your day on the Atlantic.This article is brought to you by Thomas Cook,  flights start from £130 in March 2013 – http://book.flythomascook.com/cheap-flights/to-Tenerife-Canary-Islands/ Share this: "

Miles of rolling green hills, jagged mountaintops, and quaint coastal villages await you up north.Whether by bus or automobile, start on any one of these 5 Northern Spain road trips and you’ll notice right away that the climate, elevations, vegetation, and general topography are extremely different from the sun-baked plains of Spain and make for some spectacular site seeing.Equipped with a trustworthy road map, your best camera, and a full tank of petrol (or a bus ticket), you’ll be prepared to explore roads less traveled, where tourists rarely trod. These are five of the most breathtaking and unique road trips you shouldn’t pass up when visiting the northern region of Spain.San Sebastián to PamplonaTake the Autovia de Leitzaran or A-15, the main freeway between the two cities. It’s a two-hour drive but is worth every minute. If you are driving from San Sebastián toward Pamplona, you’ll have the opportunity to pull over and view one of the most breathtaking scenes in the entire Basque Country. This is a small pullout where you can stop and overlook a Basque village called Berastegi. Be sure to stop here and snap a photo or two because this is a view you’ll want to show friends back home. If traveling north from Pamplona to San Sebastián, you won’t have an opportunity to pull over as the overlook is only for southbound traffic.best Hotels in San Sebastiánbest Hotels in Pamplona Santander to Gijón or Gijón to La CoruñaWeaving their way along the coast of the Cantabrian Sea are two breathtaking and unforgettable routes. If you only have time for one, take your pick; just make sure you’re on the A-8, Autovia del Cantábrico. What’s important is that you occasionally stop your car to take in some of the small coastal towns, which are opportunities to enjoy the ocean scenery, people, cuisine, and lifestyle. Surprisingly, this stretch of highway has remained hidden from most tourist catalogs and will surely have you convinced that you’ve uncovered a lost civilization.Best Hotels in SantanderBest Hotels in La CoruñaBilbao to Guernica (Basque Country Road Trip)Perhaps the heart of coastal Basque Country, this route will take you on a smaller road that weaves in and out of many small Basque villages. Be sure to take the BI-631 from Bilbao as it will lead you gradually along the Bay of Biscay to visit some lovely coastal villages, such as Bermeo and Mundaka, both famous for their world-class surfing. Your destination is Guernica, a town with historical significance, so do some reading up on your mobile device when you arrive.Best Hotels in BilbaoBest Hotels in GuernicaLeón to AvilésFrom Castilla y León through Asturias is a route that is not to be missed. Take the A-66 (the actual name of this highway changes, so make sure you follow A-66) high into the Cantabrian Mountains where you’ll get to witness the amazing skill of farmers who grow crops on the sides of virtual cliffs. If you are traveling north along this route, be sure to stop once or twice upon crossing into Asturias to enjoy the breathtaking views and overlooks. As you near the coast you’ll pass through Oviedo and then on to Avilés, a small industrial town with a really great beach called Salinas. Also, Asturias is the Cider capital of Spain, and I’m not talking apple juice. Just ask for la cidra.Best Hotels in LeónBest Hotels in AvilésVitoria to Logroño (La Rioja wine country)From Vitoria take the N-I toward Miranda de Ebro. Before you arrive at Miranda de Ebro, take the N-124 south toward Logroño. Then you’ll have a choice of traveling on the N-232a or taking N-232 to Logroño. Both routes wind you through the heart of the Spanish wine country and eventually lead to Logroño. Some of these roads are small and extremely curvy so you may want to avoid this route altogether or take the larger A-124 freeway—which is less scenic—if you have a tendency to get sick from this type of drive.Best Hotels in VitoriaBest Hotels in LogroñoResourcesCheap Flights to SpainConclusionSpain is a beautiful country with much to offer. If you feel like getting off the beaten path and away from crowded tourist destinations, don’t be afraid to venture up north where the land is green, the food is from the sea, and the road is wide in front of you!This article was written by eSpanishTeacher http://www.eSpanishTeacher.com, whose passion is helping people learn Spanish quickly and effectively. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/app-review-basque-country-cuisine-culture/,App Review: Basque Country Cuisine & Culture,Spain,"If you are traveling to the Basque Country with your iPhone or iPad in tow, this is a wonderful resource to take along (and do some pre-trip reading).  The Basque Country is known for its unique culture and cuisine, so these are two areas you’ll want to know a little more about to better enjoy your trip.The app is not meant to be a trip planner or comprehensive guide book, but makes a perfect complement to other resources.  I used the app before and during a recent trip through Rioja, Bilbao, San Sebastian and Pamplona (the app currently doesn’t cover much regarding Rioja or Pamplona, but it sounds like plans are in the works to expand).  We had the trip planned out in terms of hotels and a few major activities, but this guide helped us delve further in to each area.If you’re traveling outside of your data plan’s borders, you will especially appreciate that most of this guide’s features are available offline (because of that, it does take up more space than many apps).  This often limits the usefulness of other apps and online information to trying to get on wifi and therefore not always being able to quickly access information on the go.  I loved being able to reference this guide as we walked around, for example, doing the “txikiteo” amongst the pintxos bars.  Mark has written fun, accessible descriptions and tidbits about various pintxos bars, restaurants, museums and more.The app is easy to use and offers various ways to search, so it is simple to navigate.  Before our trip and during some of our drives, I would peruse a category by region and read about some of the sites of interest to get ideas.  This helped point us to Petritegi Tolare Sagardotegia (cider house), outside of San Sebastian, an experience I am glad we did not miss.  Mark’s information was even more accurate than our hotel concierge in terms of the time/cost of the taxi and gave us an idea what to expect of the evening.  As the staff gave us a quick overview in Spanish, I checked the app to read what Mark had written to feel comfortable that I understood the process and meal correctly.  (There is generally a set meal at the Sidrerias which Mark describes well, and you meander around with other patrons tasting cider from the various barrels as they tap different varieties, wandering back to enjoy your meal in between tastes.)We also let the app guide us to several pintxos bars in Bilbao and San Sebastian and enjoyed all the recommendations.  As we headed out one day for lunch in San Sebastian with no particular plans, we read a description that sounded like just what we wanted and ended up with a great home-style meal for a bargain.  It was also nice to be able to quickly pull up an entry, for example the Guggenheim Museum, before going to check prices, hours and get a quick overview.The menu decoder seems a little sparse with all the diversity of Basque cuisine, but gives you a good overview of some things to recognize and seek out, along with some more basic Spanish menu items which could be useful if you had not previously traveled in Spain.  I generally did not use the map portion of the app, simply referring to the addresses in the app and using our small city maps.Reading through the app not only gives you a list of places to check out, but a glimpse in to the culture and special experiences so that you can better soak in the joys of this area.  Make sure to peruse the beautiful photo section too!  If you haven’t yet planned a trip, reading through this guide will certainly inspire you to start planning.  My next time back I will have the app handy and continue my rounds of some of the many recommendations.  The app left me “hungry” for more!Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/5-reasons-why-you-must-visit-san-sebastian-spain/,"5 Reasons Why You Must Visit San Sebastian, Spain",Spain,"San Sebastian, known in the Basque tongue as Donostia, is a medium-sized city on the northern coast of Spain, fronted by the Bay of Biscay. The capital of Gipuzkoa, one of the historical territories of the Basque Autonomous Community, San Sebastian is a major hotspot of tourism in the country. With a vibrant culture, splendid scenery, and a mild climate, the city beckons visitors at all times of the year.CuisineYou could happily structure your entire trip to San Sebastian around eating. This is an excellent destination for the gourmand, and partaking in regional fare is certainly among the best ways to participate in the culture. Typical Basque cuisine—drawing on the fruits of both the sea and the hills, with much fish, game, vegetables, and sheep-milk cheeses—thrives here, and the city still supports “txokos,” traditionally male-dominated Basque gastronomical societies. There is perhaps no finer way to sample a host of flavors than to do as the locals and commence a “txikiteo,” a bar crawl centered around the tapas-like “pintxos” dishes. Named for the toothpick that usually skewers them, pintxos often consist of bread stacked with meats, cheeses, vegetables, and other accoutrements, and accompanied by wine or beer. Some of Spain’s finest restaurants—and certainly some of its most lively txikiteo routes—call San Sebastian home.Festivals and EventsThere’s nearly always something lively and organized going on in San Sebastian. This is the famous home of the San Sebastian International Film Festival, launched in 1953 and one of the world’s premier celebrations of cinema. One of Europe’s longest-running jazz festivals is held in San Sebastian in the summer. There is the bold observance of the feast of Saint Sebastian—the city’s namesake in both Spanish and Basque—in the 24-hour-long Tamborrada festival, driven by drumming, parades, and food. There’s also the cultural showcase of Basque Week in September, not long after the dramatic parades of “giants” and “big heads” during the hugely varied parties and activities of the Semana Grande/Aste Nagusia. Another defining event in San Sebastian is the great summertime bicycle race, the Clasica de San Sebastian.SceneryThere’s plenty of urban energy to soak in while you’re visiting San Sebastian, but the quiet grandeur of its natural setting is equally magnetic. Aside from the great sweep of the Bay of Biscay—that bight of the North Atlantic that forms the deep gouge between Spain and France—there are the rugged hills just inland. These hills— Adarra, Ulia, Igeldo, and other prominent summits—are some of the most spectacular landmarks in the area. Many of these hill and mountain tops provide excellent vantages for bird’s-eye views of San Sebastian and its geographic context, as from the Igeldo Tower on Mount Igeldo, with its iconic prospect over the city and La Concha Bay.BeachesYou needn’t just admire the coast from afar. San Sebastian has a number of beautiful beaches for lounging, swimming, and boating. The biggest and most well-known is Playa de Concha, but there’s also Playa de Ondarreta and Playa de la Zurriola. You can soak in a little architecture and culture along with those rays of sunshine. Playa de la Zurriola, for example, is overlooked by the striking Kursaal Convention Center and Auditorium, designed by Rafael Moneo and the site of the San Sebastian International Film Festival.We’ve barely begun to evoke the unique vibrancy and atmosphere of San Sebastian, but these five general attractions certainly provide a good introduction. However your plans end up shaping out, you’re sure to enjoy some excellent food, exposure to a proud and colorful culture, and serene panoramas stretching from green ridges to wave-washed sea.Elli is a writer for www.YourLocalSecurity.com.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/5-free-attractions-to-visit-in-barcelona/,5 Free Attractions to Visit in Barcelona,Spain,"Whether you’re visiting Barcelona whilst backpacking around Europe, or simply looking for a budget city break, it’s always handy to know what places you can visit without breaking the bank. Tours and excursions can seriously bump up the cost of your holiday budget, and it’s a good idea to interweave some free entry trips into your itinerary to give the purse-strings a welcomed break.The Catalonian capital of Barcelona is a firm favorite for all types of travelers, with its all-encompassing appeal of art, history, sport, cuisine, nightlife, and beaches. Barcelona really does have it all. We’ve highlighted the top 5 free attractions to visit whilst visiting this fantastically diverse city.1. Parc GuellA magnificent and unfinished masterpiece by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi – Park Guell offers free admission and is a must-see attraction when visiting Barcelona. Strolling around Park Guell, you will feel as if you have been transported into a fairy-tale land, with colorful, fanciful buildings, and fascinating shapes and structures to admire. It won’t just be the spectacular architecture that captures your attention either, as Park Guell is situated on the top of El Carmel Hill, offering breath-taking views of the city. There is no charge to stroll around Park Guell, however, there is a small admission fee if you would like to visit Gaudi’s former home, La Torre Rosa.2. Magic FountainIf you’re mesmerized by colorful lighting, music, and rhythmic performances, then ensure you stop by the Magic Fountain to watch this spectacular water show. At regular intervals throughout the evening, the fountain puts on a show-stopping performance of spurting water jets, illuminated by colorful lights, and accompanied by classical music. Located in Placa de Espanya, it is free to observe this amazing spectacle and is a magical moment to share with a loved one.3. Barcelona CathedralBoth the interior and exterior of Barcelona’s City Cathedral are fine representations of exquisite neo-gothic architecture. Construction of the original cathedral commenced in the 13th century, however, its distinctive façade wasn’t enhanced until the 19th century, turning the structure into the impressive spectacle it is today. It is free to visit the cathedral; however, it costs €1 to visit the museum and €2 to visit the cathedral roof, if you choose to do so.4. Boqueria MarketBarcelona’s largest city market, Boqueria Market, is located in the Ciutat Vella. The market is open every day, apart from Sunday, and is a vibrant, bustling hub of activity, with an array of stalls selling colorful fruit and vegetables, meat, fish and tapas. The grounds of this popular tourist attraction have always been home to commercial activity, dating back as far as 1217, when the area contained a small meat market. It is free to visit Boqueria Market, and although you may choose to purchase a few delights of your own, it is an experience in itself just to wander around the busy stalls at no cost.5. Parc de la CiutadellaSpanning 70 acres, Barcelona’s City Park is a haven to hang out in with good weather, and has many attractions to entertain visitors of all ages. As with many landmarks in Barcelona, the work of Antoni Gaudi can be viewed here, in the form of The Cascada – a fountain surrounded by sculptures, located in the northern area of the park. Barcelona has its very own version of the Arc de Triomf, which resides in the Parc de la Ciutadella for visitors to admire. It is free to visit the park, and you then have the option to visit the variety of paid attractions, such as the park’s museum, or Barcelona Zoo.Tip: These featured attractions are free to visit all year round, however if you’re looking for the best value for your holiday budget then make sure your visit to Barcelona falls over the first Sunday of the month, when a selection of key attractions open their doors for free entry. Plan your schedule and receive free admission into the likes of the Picasso Museum, National Art Gallery of Catalonia, and Pedralbes Monastery.Getting there  – Barcelona is served by Barcelona El Prat Airport (BCN) and there are numerous cheap international flights because of the cruises that begin and end at Barcelona. Barcelona is also connected to Madrid by high-speed train which makes it easy to add it to a larger Spain itinerary.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/sunshine-and-shellfish-on-a-city-break-in-vigo-spain/,"Sunshine and Shellfish on a City Break in Vigo, Spain",Spain,"The marina in Vigo, GaliciaIn the Galician city of Vigo in northwest Spain you can kick back and indulge in some of the finest seafood in the world; pad along white, sandy beaches; and absorb Galicia’s distinct culture – all without having to battle your way through heaving crowds of tourists.While 80% of overseas visitors flock to Santiago de Compostela, the region’s capital, Vigo in contrast remains untouched by mass tourism – and all the more pleasant for it.A square in Vigo’s old townPerhaps many are put off by the fact that Vigo is home to the world’s largest fishing port – but for travellers who give the city a chance, all this is more than balanced out by the leafy, pleasant old town, glitzy marina, classy seafood restaurants, and dozens of beautiful beaches within easy reach of the centre. It’s also just a short boat trip over to the gorgeous Cíes Islands, part of the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park, and the area’s sheltered position gives it warmer temperatures than are found in most rival Galician destinations. There are plenty of attractions, too. You can enjoy panoramic views from the ancient settlement at O Castro; explore a Galician stately home at Pazo Museo Quiñones de León; see contemporary art at MARCO; or find out about Vigo’s relationship with the sea at the wonderful Museo Do Mar De Galicia.Barnacles, from the Galician coastline near VigoHowever, it is the cuisine that really leaves the greatest impression of all. Galician people are justifiably proud of their food, and Vigo in particular offers some outstanding gastronomic experiences. Local percebeiros risk their lives to collect barnacles from the cliffs before the fierce Atlantic waves crash in on them, and back at local restaurants they’re prepared freshly and simply and served up to well-heeled diners. Simpler tapas come at a much smaller price – with local favourites including Pulpo á feira (octopus), grilled sardines, stuffed pastry empanadas, and deliciously spicy Pimientos de Padrón (peppers). A stroll around the port area or the old town offers endless dining options, from inexpensive, laid-back tapas bars to upmarket fish restaurants. And since locals eat late, you have plenty of time for sightseeing without having to rush back early to catch a bite to eat.Trip planningSpanish airline Vueling now offers direct flights to Vigo from Heathrow or Barcelona.

https://amateurtraveler.com/late-night-lockout-in-barcelona/,Late night lockout in Barcelona,Spain,"Image courtesy of Jordi TouzaAfter a beautiful, sunny summer’s day in Barcelona, my family and I were worn out but thoroughly enamoured with the Catalonian capital. We had shopped until we dropped on Las Ramblas, toured Camp Nou stadium, and transported ourselves into the wonderful world of Gaudi architecture at Park Guell. Time, we decided, to head back to our car and drive back to our campsite at Sagunto, three hours south along the coast.We had given ourselves plenty of time for the drive back, and sauntered over to the car park at around 6pm, pausing briefly on the way to buy souvenirs of our day out. We arrived at the car park a few minutes before the stroke of 6pm, only to find the shutters were down and nobody was around. We read the opening times and the car park was definitely due to close at 6pm, but it wasn’t quite that time yet and here we were, locked out!With not a soul in sight, we called a phone number that was printed on a scruffy looking sticker on the car park shutter that read ‘Call This Number to Release Your Car’. After trying to communicate with a non-English speaker on a very crackly phone line and failing miserably, we gave up on that option – not that it appeared particularly legitimate anyway! We had found a great deal on travel insurance through moneysupermarket.com but we were fairly sure it wouldn’t cover us for enlisting someone to illegally break into a car park!Passers-by gave us shrugs of our shoulders when we explained our situation and, after an hour or so of floundering, we accepted our fate and went in search of accommodation for the night.In a great, sprawling tourist city like Barcelona, we felt assured that finding a couple of rooms for the night would be no problem whatsoever, and set about taking our pick of the hotels.There were plenty to choose from in the area near where we were parked, just by the University of Barcelona and Jardins de la Reina Victoria, but our first enquiry, at a hotel just opposite Barcelona City Hall, was flatly rejected as the hotel was full. We got the same response at the second hotel, and the third, the fourth and the fifth. We could barely believe our ears as each receptionist delivered the news and, after a good 15 attempts, we were still out on the street with nowhere to go, and the time was after 11pm.After bumping into a friendly crowd of tourists, we were offered the suggestion of sleeping on the beach – something that many tourists resort to for a cheap night’s rest during the balmy summer months. I personally was open to this idea, if a little cautious of incurring the wrath of the Spanish authorities should beach camping turn out to be frowned upon. But anyway, my parents were having none of it and we grimly resigned ourselves to our ongoing hotel hunt.Feeling a little lost after much walking around, my father flagged down a taxi. We explained our situation to the driver, who listened intently and then confidently told us he knew where we would be assured of a room for the night. Off we sped, excitedly looking forward to a good night’s rest after a rather longer day than anticipated!We pulled up at a rather nice looking, glass-fronted hotel and the taxi driver hopped out of his cab and talked to the concierge. From the taxi, we could see some shaking of heads, followed by some pointing. Were we to be denied again?The driver returned with the news that the hotel was full, but the place next door had just two rooms left. We looked at the building next door; an innocuous looking block of flats with yellow light coming from its entrance hallway.To our surprise and relief, the accommodation we had finally found was perfectly pleasant and we sent the cabby away with a handshake and a substantial tip for his efforts.That night we slept better than ever, and enjoyed a safe journey back to our campsite the following day. The lesson learned: don’t be late, or even borderline late, for anything when travelling in Spain. Especially car parks closing. And don’t be afraid put your faith in the knowledge of a good Catalonian taxi driver – it could save you a lot of walking! Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/travel-to-lanzarote-in-the-canary-islands/,Travel To Lanzarote in the Canary Islands,Spain,"The Canary Islands are a hugely popular tourist destination amongst European travellers. Attracting around nine million visitors every year. But these seven little specks of Spain are not all birds of a feather. With each island boasting its own unique character and culture.Lanzarote is the most easterly outpost in the archipelago and is located just 80 miles off the coast of Morocco in West Africa. On the same line of latitude as parts of the Bahamas and Florida. Creating a great year round climate, characterised by very low rainfall and with temperatures that rarely fall below 20CDuring the 1730´s the island was subjected to a series of massive volcanic eruptions that lasted for over six years. This devastated large swathes of Lanzarote – swallowing up farmland, destroying villages and forcing widespread emigration.Today however this twisted terrain is the most popular tourist attraction on the island. As the surreal scenery of the Timanfaya Volcano Park is literally out of this world – and is often likened to the surface of the moon.Elsewhere on the island, an artist called César Manrique has married this topography with his own exuberant imagination to create a series of breathtaking visitor attractions. Such as the huge underground auditorium and concert hall at the Jameos del Agua. Which has been fashioned out of a collapsed lava tunnel. As well as his own home and studio in Tahiche – developed out of five bubbles in the lava flow.Thanks to Manrique´s industry and inventiveness Lanzarote became the hot new holiday spot for the in crowd in the 1970´s. Attracting VIP visitors and actors such as Rita Heyworth, Peter Sellers and Omar Sharif. The latter even commissioned a holiday home on the island, designed by Manrique. Which he promptly lost in a game of bridge. But which is now home to one of Lanzarote´s leading restaurants – LagOmar, or Omar’s Lake.Manrique´s influence extends well beyond the creation of visitor attractions alone though. As the island’s favourite son also fought an ongoing battle against unrestrained tourist development on Lanzarote. Successfully securing a ban on all high rise construction and advertising billboards in the process. So ensuring that despite the high volume of tourist visitors the island still remains largely unspoiled, especially outside of the main resorts.Thanks to his work – in tandem with Lanzarote´s volcanic terrain – the island was declared a UNESCO protected biosphere in 1994.Find out more about Lanzarote and download a 96 page guidebook to the island, entirely free of charge.

https://amateurtraveler.com/3-days-in-normandy/,"Normandy Itinerary – 3 Days in Normandy, France",France,"The name Normandy has a special significance for those of us who grew up in the United States. It is a place that brings up mental images of Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers… and if you are old enough… The Longest Day. But Normandy was making history long before WWII and I have been wanting to visit as long as I can remember.A canal cruise in southern France brought my wife and me to France so we decided to add on 3 extra days in Normandy. What can you see in only 3 days in an area rich with history? Quite a lot as it turns out. Here is my suggested itinerary.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Paris to NormandyBayeuxDay 1Normandy BeachesSainte-Mère-ÉgliseUtah BeachPointe du Hoc Ranger MonumentOmaha BeachDay 2Mont Saint-MichelCider and Calvados at Billy’s FarmBayeux TapestryDay 3HonfleurRouenParisFoodMap of NormandyParis to NormandyWe arrived in France in the afternoon and immediately rented a car and headed to the town of Bayeux in Normandy. We could have taken the train or flown to Normandy but unless you are taking a tour, you will want a car to get around. Driving is on the right and most French drivers are pretty good… at least up to 110 Kilometers per hour.I don’t suggest you get on a 10 hour overnight flight and then drive for 3 hours until you have learned how to sleep on a plane, although that is what we did. The tolls on the route from Charles de Gaulle airport to Bayeux were 24.80 euros.If you want to play it safe there are some airport hotels that are ridiculously easy to get to from the Charles de Gaulle airport. Take the train from the Terminal where you land to Terminal 3 where you can catch a train to the city but instead of taking the train, reserve one of these hotels which are just outside the doors of Terminal 3. We stayed in the ibis Paris CDG Airport which is basic but modern.ibis Paris CDG AirportcitizenM Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportNovotel Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportPullman Paris Roissy Cdg AirportHilton Paris Charles De Gaulle Airportibis Styles Paris Charles de Gaulle AirportGet some sleep and then return in the morning to pick up a rental car.BayeuxWe chose a home base of the historic town of Bayeux (pronounced something like “ba yuh”). We stayed in the lovely Hotel Le Lion D’Or which is right in the historic center of town.Bayeux was the jumping-off point for the invasion of England by William the Conqueror and Bayeux was also the first French city to be liberated in Normandy in 1944.Day 1We dedicated the first full day of our visit to the WWII history surrounding the Normandy landings.Normandy BeachesIt is 4 miles south from the Normandy coast and about in the middle between the U.S. invasion beaches and the British and Canadian beaches during D-Day June 6, 1944.The beaches sit on a section of France’s coast that faces north towards England.The U.S. beaches of Utah and Omaha are to the north and west from Bayeux and the British and Canadian beaches of Gold, Juno, and Sword to the north and east from Bayeux.With only one day for the beaches, I would explore one half or the other depending on which you are more affiliated with. We opted for the western U.S. invasion zone. We spent Thursday visiting some of this 50 mile stretch of beaches.Sainte-Mère-ÉgliseSainte-Mère-Église was at the far western end of the allied landings on D-day just past Utah beach. The landings at Utah were a gamble because the land behind the beach had been flooded by the Germans and the beach was only accessible by a few narrow causeways. American paratroopers were dropped into the area in the early morning hours or landed by glider. Their mission was to secure the vital causeways off Utah beach. They succeeded although with significant losses. But their failure would have doomed many who landed at Utah beach.Sainte-Mère-Église has the distinction of being the first French town liberated by Allied groups.We started with the Airborne Museum in Sainte-Mère-Église. This was a fascinating high tech museum that handed you an interactive tablet when you entered that you could use to see the field you were on covered with gliders in the early hours of June 6th or you could watch yourself jump out of a plane and possibly end up stuck on the church steeple like one unfortunate parachutist.When you look up at the steeple of the church in Sainte-Mère-Église you can still see a mannequin dressed as a parachutist that hangs there. This is a reminder of John Steele of the 82nd Airborne who did, in fact, end up trapped hanging from the church belfry for two hours feigning death until he was retrieved and captured by German soldiers. He was part of two sticks (planeloads) of soldiers dropped in error directly on the town. Many of those soldiers were wounded or killed. He managed to escape captivity after 5 days so he was fortunate. For some unique stain glass windows go inside the church. One window has Madonna and child surrounded by paratroopers. Another has Saint Michael, the patron saint of paratroopers, with sword drawn which bears saying “Ils Sont Revenus” “They Have Come Back”). The first was designed by a local artist in 1945 and the second was commissioned by veterans of the 82nd Airborne on the 25th anniversary of their jump.Utah BeachAfter Sainte-Mère-Église we drove to Utah Beach which has a terrific museum built around one of the original German bunkers. That bunker is now the restaurant Le Roosevelt which makes a great spot to stop for lunch. The restaurant is named after the highest-ranking general to participate in the first wave of the invasion, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. the son of the president. He survived the landings, but the 57-year-old Roosevelt died of a heart attack in France a month later.A popular photo spot is in front of the Higgens boat statue outside where 3 U.S. G.I.s are perpetually hitting the beach. The museum houses many notable exhibits including an original B26-Martin Marauder bomber and a Higgens boat (landing craft, vehicle, personnel – LCVP).Take a moment to walk through the dunes for a view of what is now a peaceful beach. Development is very restricted on the landing beaches.Pointe du Hoc Ranger MonumentMidway between the Utah and Omaha beaches was a German gun emplacement on a promontory sitting on cliffs where the Germans could steel both landing beaches. On the early morning of June 6th, a specially trained group of U.S. Rangers approached the cliffs from the water and fired large grappling hooks so that they could scale the cliffs and disable the guns. The boats first ended up on the wrong part of the shore, then the grappling hooks did not work as planned.Much went wrong with the operation including the surprise that when they finally reached the top after great loss of life the guns had been moved. They were however quickly located and disabled. The Pointe du Hoc Ranger Monument includes the remains of the original German positions and the shell craters from the initial naval bombardment of the site.Omaha BeachOmaha Beach was the bloodiest of the 5 landing beaches. This is the beach we watched Tom Hanks and his squad assault in Saving Private Ryan. These days a large metal sculpture dominates the beach. The sculpture, Les Braves Omaha Beach Memorial, is supposed to represent the wings of Hope and Fraternity as well as the call “Rise, Freedom!”.There are a great number of museums in the Normandy area. The museum at Omaha beach was one of the ones with a good reputation but we mistakenly visited the one right by the beach which frankly I don’t think is worth your time. Skip that and visit the one further back that road called the Overlord Museum. The D-Day landings were the opening battle of the Battle of Normandy which bore the codename Operation Overlord.The largest of the American cemeteries is near Omaha Beach. It is worth a visit, especially at the end of the afternoon when they will blow taps and lower the American Flag.Day 2The second day we venture to the western edge of Normandy where it meets up with Britany. There, just off the mouth of the rivers Sélune, Sée and Couesnon is the medieval monastery and fortress of Mont Saint-Michel.Mont Saint-MichelWe visited the abbey of Mont Saint-Michel. You have probably seen pictures of this abbey built on a rock in the bay off the coast of Normandy. So had we but we still let out an involuntary “wow” when it came into view. We had been told about how bad the crowds get, but all I can say is visit at the end of March like we did to escape the crowds in Normandy. Our weather has been chilly in the mornings but sunny and warm by mid-day.We did see that if you are there when the crowds are you can take the main busy tourist street up to the abbey or just inside the gate you can take the back way up. We went up one way and back the other.Mont Saint-Michel is known for its tides that turn the abbey into an island at high tide, or at least they used to before the causeway was built. We parked our car where everyone must park and then instead of taking the free shuttle we walked out to the abbey to enjoy the views. It does take a while to walk so we grabbed the free shuttle back again.Mont Saint-Michel is quite touristy when you are on the main drag but I loved it. We did not do all the tiny museums you can at Mont Saint-Michel: Archeoscope, Museum of history, Maritime and ecology museum, and Tiphaine’s house. You can get a combined entry for 9 euros but they seemed to have mixed reviews. The signage, as we understand, is only in French so we opted to skip them on our abbreviated 3-day visit.We did tour the main abbey with the audio guide tour which I would highly recommend. Admission was 10 euros each plus we got one audio guide for 3 euros. The audio guide described how the different rooms were used over the ages including a time when the island was a prison in the 1700s.Mont Saint-Michel abbey and the bay are a UNESCO World Heritage site.Cider and Calvados at Billy’s FarmOur visit to Mont Saint-Michel did not take all day so we used some of the afternoon to taste the apple cider and calvados that Normandy is known for. The area grows a lot of apples so some smart French person long ago figured out that there must be some way to make them into alcohol. While we were familiar with hard cider we had never tried calvados which is apple or pear brandy.We walked around the grounds of the farm including some of the orchards. There is a chapel on the grounds that we later learned is original to the farm from the 1600s. We also walked through the barrel room where the Calvados was aging.When we got back to the tasting room, a young woman offered us tastings of 3 ciders, 3 vintages of Calvados (44% alcohol) and a 2 different pommeaus (mixture of Calvados and apple juice, at 17 and 22% alcohol) and an ice apple cider (or wine, we aren’t sure) made by letting the apples freeze. The 3 ciders varied by sweetness level: sweet, fraische, and brut. The Calvados began at aged 8, 12 or 25 years. We liked the middle of both ranges. We were surprised to find that we liked the ice wine, which isn’t light like grape ice wine and is richer, a bit like a port. We got a bottle of that to take with us.We found a great place to taste cider at Billy’s Farm in Rots, which is 23 minutes east of Bayeux. Billy’s Farm was a quirky laid-back farm with lots of art and character. They also happen to make good apple alcohol.Bayeux TapestryIn Bayeux, you can find the historic Bayeux Tapestry which we visited at the end of day 2. The Bayeux Tapestry is a 230 foot long (70 meters) tapestry that tells the story of the invasion of England in 1066 from William’s point of view.The tapestry depicts William the Conqueror’s victory over Harold the “oath breaker”. Pay special attention to the story before the invasion where Harold swears an oath to William and even fights alongside him. Keep an eye out for Halley’s Comet that makes an unnerving appearance around the death of King Edward the Confessor, Harold’s brother-in-law. Harold’s death without heir precipitated the Norman Invasion.The tapestry is housed in its own museum which takes about an hour and a half to visit. It is well-presented so that even non-history buffs can appreciate it.Day 3On our 3rd day, we needed to make our way back to Charles de Gaulle to catch the TGV the next day down to southern France for our luxury canal barge cruise. We worked our way back through two old historic cities of Normandy.HonfleurThe harbor at Honfleur connects the strategic Seine River with the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. It was a major harbor for the French until the building of the modern harbor at Le Havre. It started to decline during the 18th century which preserved the historic nature of the old city.Besides the colorful harbor the other site to see in Honfleur is the wooden church of Saint Catherine of Alexandria which is the oldest wooden church in France. The church was constructed as a “temporary church” just after the Hundred Year’s War. The church builders were shipbuilders and you can see how its double nave looks like two upside-down ships. One of the reasons it still stands is that the bell tower was constructed unconnected to the church in case of fire started by lightning strikes… which did happen.When we arrived there was a large market near the port and by the church, with clothing, baskets, fish, meat, baked goods, and lots of produce.RouenRouen is the capital of the Normandy region. It was one of the capitals of the Anglo-Norman dynasty founded by William the Conqueror. During that time it was one of the largest and most important cities in France. The city has numerous streets with historic half-timbered buildings.The city is perhaps best known for the place where Joan of Arc was burned at the stake. Near that spot today is a church dedicated to the now canonized Joan. The church is a very modern church and quite different than the typical French church you have seen. We also saw the city’s main cathedral which is lovely but not exceptional.We visited the Fine Art Museum (Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen) which is worth a stop unless you are heading to Paris and will have time to see the art museums of that city. It is free. Some of my favorite works are in a gallery to the left of the main entrance.ParisWe stayed last night again at an airport hotel at Charles de Gaulle.FoodAlong with your glass of cider, the quintessential Normandy meal to have is a galette which is a buckwheat crepe. They are usually savory and quite filling. In Bayeux, we enjoyed a galette at Le Moulon de Galette. For dessert, we had the Notre Dame, apples, salted caramel, and we added ice cream. Less traditional but so good.Map            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/Normandy.kmz?v2"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(8);    });  }Learn more about Normandy by listening to Travel to Normandy in France – Episode 275See all my Normandy PhotosShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/french-catalonia/,Discovering Pyrénées-Orientales – A trip to French Catalonia,France,"Pyrénées-Orientales is located in Southern France between the Mediterranean sea and the Pyrenees. It’s also part of Catalonia, and its main city is Perpignan. There are tons of activities to do there, especially during summer. From relaxing at the beach and exploring natural wonders to visiting the Middle Ages castles, this part of France has a lot to offer. Listed below are some places you shouldn’t miss during your trip to Pyrénées-Orientales.Most of the sites listed below are accessible via public transportation but not all of them. It might be a good idea to rent a car for a couple of days. The most central location to stay at would be Perpignan, but you can also stay by the beach or more in the countryside near Prades or Villefranche de Conflent.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Tautavel“Les Orgues” in Ille-sur-TêtColliourePerpignanBeachesPrieuré de SerrabonaAbbaye de Saint-Martin-du-CanigouFontrabiouse CaveVillefranche de ConflentTautavelTautavel is famous for being the place where some of the oldest human remains in Europe were found. Its museum boasts an impressive prehistorical artifacts collection and is super informative.You can visit the Arago Cave where the remains were found, just know it’s not easy to access, and it’s often closed. Call the museum beforehand to check the schedule.Tautavel is also a beautiful place to spend a couple of hours, enjoying the river, especially on hot days. It might get crowded pretty quickly, so prefer going in the morning. The Gorges du Gouleyrous is the best place to go if you want to swim. It’s easy to access, and you can do some rock climbing or just enjoy the water and the view.“Les Orgues” in Ille-sur-TêtIn Ille-sur-Têt, you’ll find some of the world’s most incredible rock formations. It’s a unique landscape formed by water and five million years of erosion. The rocks are made of sand and clay and mostly come from the Pyrenees mountains. You can stroll around the area freely, it takes around an hour to visit the site. You can also arrange for a guided visit in English.The entrance fee is 5 euros, and the site is open from 9:15 AM to 8 PM during summer, only in the afternoons during the winter.CollioureCollioure is one of the last coastal villages before the border. Its small paved streets, handicraft shops, and cute pebble beaches make it the perfect destination if you want to visit a typical French village.While in Collioure, you should walk around the village, check out some locals crafts, go by the beach and visit the royal castle. The castle was build in the 13th century, the fort was added in the 16th century. It can be visited from every day from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM in July and August (10 to 5 the rest of the year). The entrance fee is 4 euros. You’ll get a panoramic view of the village and the Mediterranean from the top. It’s also a museum where you can learn more about the city’s history.If you like art, you can check out La Maison du Fauvisme, a cultural center. Many painters such as Matisse and Derain were inspired by Collioure settings. The city organizes thematic guided tours of Collioure based on Fauvism and the painters who visited the town.Find more information on Collioure on their website.Avoid restaurants there, the majority are tourists’ traps. You can drive there, but it might be hard to find a spot to park, especially during high season. Alternatively, you can take the train to get there.PerpignanPerpignan has a few sites worth visiting. The city center is a good start, strolling around the small paved streets. Don’t miss the Castillet, the city’s most iconic building. It used to be a prison and to be part of the city’s fortifications. The whole wall, apart from the Castillet, has been destroyed by developers as the city grew.You should also visit the Palais des Rois de Majorque. This medieval palace was built in the 13th century and is a reminder of Perpignan’s power over the Mediterranean basin during this period. It was turned into a citadel in the 15th century. During summer, there are often events organized there, especially concerts and plays.The entrance fee is 4 euros, and the palace is open every day from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM in July and August (10 to 5 the rest of the year). If you speak French, there are two free guided visits a day (11 AM and 3 PM).BeachesUnfortunately, this part of France doesn’t have the best beaches, but it still is a popular beach destination for budget travelers. During the summer, beaches are usually packed and busy. There are tons of water activities you can do, or you can just relax at one of the many beach clubs along the coast.Canet is the closest beach to Perpignan, it’s also the most crowded. If you want something wilder, check out Sainte-Marie-la-Mer, it’s mostly a residential area with small houses so no big concrete buildings like in Canet. If you go a bit further, you might even find a spot all to yourself. If you want something in the middle, you can spend some time in Argelès or Port Barcarès.Prieuré de SerrabonaBuilt in the 11th century in Boule D’Amont, Serrabona priory is a Roman Art masterpiece. From its marble gallery to its cloister, you’ll find fine sculptures at every corner. Most carvings feature fantastic animals, which is highly representative of Roman Art. The priory’s garden is also worth a look.The entrance fee is 4 euros. It can be visited every day from 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM in July and August (10 to 5 the rest of the year).Abbaye de Saint-Martin-du-CanigouIn Casteil, a small Pyrenean village, you’ll find the Saint-Martin-du-Canigou Abbey, built in 1009. The abbey is a jewel of Roman architecture and keeps many artistic treasures. After a short trek from the village, you’ll reach the Abbey, you can keep going to have a nicer view.During summer, the abbey organizes guided visits every hour from 10 AM to 5 PM. The entrance fee is 6 euros.Fontrabiouse CaveThis huge cave, discovered in 1958 by accident, is a great way to learn more about geology.

They are easy to visit, the most frequented is the Grandes Canalettes cave. You can check out their official website for more information. The entrance fee is 10 euros.In Villefranche, you can also visit Fort Liberia, a military fortress built by Vauban in 1680 and fortified by Napoleon the third. It’s connected by a steep staircase to the medieval city below, the only way to access it unless you have a 4 wheeler, it takes around 20 minutes on foot to reach the fort. The entrance fee is 7 euros, they also organize guided visits in English.Below, in the village, you can have a look at the city’s fortifications built from the 11th to the 19th century and enjoy the quiet, rural atmosphere. The settings are perfect, surrounded by nature and mountains, Villefranche is a great place to disconnect for a whileShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/cruising-on-the-canal-du-midi-carcassonne/,Cruising on the Canal du Midi – A Luxury Barge Cruise in Southern France including Carcassonne,France,"When Pierre-Paul Riquet made plans for a canal in France between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic in the 1600s, it is likely that he did not have in mind a route for luxury barge hotels, but the Canal du Midi that used to carry wheat and wine now carries tourists and I was fortunate to be one thanks to European Waterways.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}The EnchantéThe Canal du MidiThe LocksThe CrewThe FoodThe ExcursionsL’OuliboMinerveNarbonneLagrasseWine TastingCarcassonneConclusionFrance has over 3,000 kilometers of canals that crisscross the country. All of them fill with tourists in the summer months. Many of these in rented “plastic boats” but some in old freight barges that have been turned into floating luxury boutique hotels. The Hotel Barge Enchanté is one of these barges. When I mentioned to my wife that we had an opportunity to sail on a luxury hotel barge it was the word “barge” that she focused on at first. People who we mentioned our trip to got a funny look on their face and would ask if the barge had cabins. The word that you should focus on is “luxury”.The EnchantéOwners Louisa and Roger Gronow converted an old freight barge into the luxury hotel barge it is today. They created it especially for the Canal du Midi. It is unusually tall, at 2 stories tall, for the hotel barges on the canal. Most of the other hotel barges are a story and a half. The Enchanté needs to carry 80 tons of ballast to ride low enough in the canal so that its wheel house will clear the lowest bridges. It is the deepest boat that cruises the canal. Even at that the new sunshade over the outdoor dining table, that was installed last season, has hydraulics so that the captain can raise and lower it from his perch at the back of the boat.The barge that the Gronow’s bought was still filled with sand and gravel that they had to shovel out before the conversion work started. The very first project was to cut the ship in half to remove an 8 meter section and convert a 38 meter long freight barge to a 30 meter (about 100 feet) long hotel barge that would fit in the locks on the Canal du Midi. Their second boat the Finesse is 39 meters long because it operates in Burgundy where the locks are longer than on the Canal du Midi.At least one bridge we passed was so low the the captain had to take the large steering wheel off of its axle to clear it, but for most he just had to duck.The passenger part of the Enchanté is the front two thirds of the boat with the crew area and the wheel house in the back. In the front of the boat are storage for a set of 8 foldable bikes, followed by a jacuzzi and an outdoor dining table.Behind this are a set of spiral stairs down to the passenger cabins, a lounge area with a couch and some chairs, then the glass dining table and open kitchen area.The Enchanté has two levels with its 4 two person passenger cabins downstairs. Below decks both the Enchanté and the Finesse have 4 passenger cabins with two single beds or one double bed. So each boat only carries 8 passengers at most.From the cabins the portholes open up on a view of the waterline of the canal.Each cabin has an ensuite bathroom with shower, sink and toilet. The bathrooms are tiled with stone tile work.Sailing in the first week in April we were on the first cruise of the season so we only had 4 passengers. When Roger started as a captain with European Waterways 20 years ago the same size barge as the Finesse carried 24 passengers in bunk beds but passengers these days want more space, more excursions and better food than in those days.The Canal du MidiThe Canal du Midi was an engineering marvel when it was finished in 1681. Many naysayers told Riquet that the canal would not have sufficient water to operate but not only were they wrong but the canal has been operating since 1681. Riquet died a year before the canal was completed so he never had the opportunity to say whatever the 17th century’s version of “I told you so” was. His family owned the canal for more than a century until the French Revolution but it did not pay off its original investment until 100 years after it started operating.The canal is 240 km (~150 miles) long and connects the Garonne River (with cities Bordeaux and Toulouse) to the Mediterranean near Narbonne and Sète. We were cruising a smaller portion between Le Somail and Trèbes. The hotel barges used to cruise for longer distances and for more time but the passengers got a bit of cabin fever so now we spent about half of the day out exploring the countryside and only 2-3 hours cruising.If you have seen pictures of the Canal du Midi you have probably seen a canal lined with Plane Trees (a tree related to the Sycamore) but over the last 5 years many of these trees were killed by a fungus that was spread through the tree roots and the waters of the canal. Many places on the canal have newly planted trees to replace the Plane Trees. It is one of the reasons that the Enchanté now has a sunshade. Make sure you look for a boat that is air-conditioned like the Enchanté if you are visiting in the heat of the summer.Where we boarded at Le Somail we saw bridge with a plaque dedicated to Thomas Jefferson who visited the Canal du Midi to understand more of its operation while he was ambassador to France.Another historic oddity we stumbled upon was an optical semaphore tower in Marseillette which was one of a series of towers built in the time of the French revolution by Claude Chappe to carried coded military messages in the south of France.The LocksOf course what makes the canal work are a series of locks and aqueducts which are one of the highlights of cruising the canal. The locks are run by lock keepers. They open at 9am stay open until 7pm most of the season except for an hour at lunchtime. The lock keeper no longer has to turn a big manual wheel, on this section, to open or close the locks but has a remote control. But much of the rest of the process is unchanged since the canal opened.The locks on the Canal du Midi have an unusual oval shape which I have not seen on later canals. Riquet believed that this would make the locks stronger.The captain has an easier job steering into the lock on the run uphill on the canal when he can see the large metal gates.At each lock there was a traditional lockkeeper’s house. On each was a plaque that said how many meters it was to the next locks in each direction. Some of the lockkeeper’s houses  were a bit more unusual. At least two had the work of local artists.One of the members of the crew will be on the shore and will tie down the Enchanté in the lock before the doors are closed and the lock is flooded so you can rise to the next level of the canal.https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/France/Canal-du-Midi/i-zWvLCVz/0/0ddd7edc/1280/IMG_5931-1280.mp4The best time to get on and off the boat is before and after it starts cruising via the gangway or in the locks when it is tied off. You just alert the crew ahead of time and at the last lock (some locks are doubles and triples) they will wait until the level of the boat is at the level of the ledge and give you a hand as you cross over.The CrewAs I write this it is a bit before 10am in the morning and in the main indoor living space my wife is checking the news on her phone, using the wi-fi and the only two other passengers are visiting our captain Morgan in the wheelhouse. We interact the least with the captain whose domain is the wheelhouse and who is responsible for the boat and for getting us safely to our destination.Our chef Sylvain has started on dinner in the open kitchen just past the glass dining room table. He is preparing a dish with a celery root ball to go with the duck for tonight’s dinner. All day long he is busy in the kitchen as we have a three course meal at lunch (appetizer, main and dessert) and a four course meal at dinner (appetizer, main, cheese and dessert). Passengers are welcome to ask questions or learn how to make a certain dish or welcome just to eat heartily as has been our choice.Each meal has been a pleasure to see as well as a pure pleasure to eat. For years I have told people I don’t like fish, but Sylvain has made me a liar. All meals are made with what is fresh and what is in season.While Sylvain is busy in the kitchen our two hostesses Agata and Manora are keeping busy. Agata was laying out a buffet breakfast by 7am with fruit, cheeses, fresh local pastries, cereal and eggs cooked on request. It is Manora’s turn to clean the cabins and I last saw her washing the windows below decks.Our tour guide Claire is off in the van somewhere in the countryside. She makes the early morning run for fresh pastries, each day from a different bakery along our route. She will show up at the next set of locks to handle the ropes to tie up the barge as the lock fills. Later this afternoon we will hop in the van on an excursion.The FoodIt would be wrong to not pause here and say that the food on the Enchanté was one of the highlights. The ingredients were fresh, the plating was gorgeous and the food was delicious. Here is a sample of some of the dishes we ate.      See photos of each of the mealshttps://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/France/Canal-du-Midi/i-3KLsQkT/0/ab90a830/1280/IMG_6018-1280.mp4I do not have the recipes for them but we did get a demonstration of how to cook salmon in a rock salt and egg white crust.The ExcursionsWe did spend a fair amount of time off the boat. Some of it was biking or walking along the towpath but much of it was spent with Claire, our tour guide, exploring the countryside in the ship’s van on tours designed by Louisa Gronow who is a certified tour guide. We had one excursion per day.L’OuliboOur excursion on the first day started at an olive processing coop where we learned more about the production of olives both for the table and for olive oil. Table olives are still hand picked because the appearance is important. For the production of olive oil you can shake the tree or rake the olives for more efficiency.Table olives like the region’s famous Lucques olive, the green gold of the Languedoc, have to be cured to take away the bitterness. One method, the greek method, is to sit them in salt for 4 months and then rinse them in fresh water 3 times for a week each time.Olives for oil are crushed with the pit which has a natural preservative. We tasted 4 different olive oils. To my palate the differences between them were subtle.It takes 6-10 kilos of olives to make a liter of olive oil. The leftover solids can be used for soap or for fertilizer.MinerveAlso on the first day we visited Minerve which is a village which has been named to the list of “Plus beaux villages de France” (most beautiful villages in France). To be on the list a village needs 2 or more special historic or scenic characteristics.Minerve is a beautiful village built on a rock outcrop between two rivers in the hills.It was also the site of a siege during the Albigensian Crusade (1209–1229) against a heretical sect of Christians known as the Cathars. The village sheltered Cathar refugees until a trebuchet (known as the bad neighbor) was used to knock out the village well.NarbonneOn the second day we traveled back to Narbonne where we had arrived by train from Paris to spend some time exploring the city.We explored the central market where many from Narbonne do their shopping at the many stalls or eat a lunch out at one of the small restaurants.We also visited the unusual cathedral in Narbonne which is the 3rd tallest in France but only about a 3rd the normal length. The original plans to knock down the city wall to make the cathedral full size were opposed by the citizens who preferred the protection of the city wall.At the Archbishop’s Palace we climbed the tallest tower to get a view of the city including the Canal de la Rabine which bisects the city. In front of the palace you can find an excavation of the original roman road which ran through the city.LagrasseLagrasse is another Plus beaux villages de France. It is the home for an important abbey which was founded in the 800s with a charter from Charlemagne. The abbot here at one time was in charge of 100 different churches or monasteries in the region.Half of the abbey is now owned by the government and can be toured. Major renovation work has been done on that portion of the site. The other half of the grounds is still an abbey with 30 monks.The town of the Lagrasse has a number of artisans who have workshops in the old medieval center.Wine TastingWe tasted a lot of local wine on our cruise, having at least 2 different wines each night, but we also did an excursion on the 4th day to a local winery Domaine Des Homs. We tried some single varietal wines but a typical red wine in the region is a blend of 2-4 grapes: Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre, Carignan. To be certified in the local A.O.P. (Appellation d’Origine Protégée) protected wine designation a wine has to have at least 2 of these varieties.But we did also enjoy some of the single varietals at Domaine Des Homs like the Grenache which they described as “simple and uncomplicated”. It was also the name of their dog who, being a dog, was also simple and uncomplicated.CarcassonneThe highlight of the touring and the reason that I booked this cruise was a visit to the walled fortress city of Carcassonne. Carcassonne is no only a pretty good board game, but one of the best preserved walled cities in Europe.It was originally decreed to be demolished in 1849 but outcry from locals and historians was able to change the plan from demolition to reconstruction under the architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Viollet-le-Duc also worked on such well known projects as Notre Dame Cathedral, Mont Saint-Michel, Sainte-Chapelle. Squatters were living in the space between its double walls when he visited the city.Viollet-le-Duc’s first decision was restore Carcassonne to what period. This is a city whose walls date back in portions to Roman walls. He decided to restore the fortress to the construction done just after the Cathars were expelled from Carcassonne in 1209 during the Albigensian Crusade.Some of the early work definitely has some historic flaws as the pointy black roofs for some of the spires would fit better in Austria than in the Languedoc.Some of the later sections with red terra cotta tiled roofs are more historically accurate. Notice the line of brick work on some of the walls that is a sign of a Roman wall.Carcassonne is a very touristy city, or at least the old city is. But it is also wonderful. Yes you can buy a plastic sword or get your picture taken in armor, but you can also stroll the old walls of this city as they would have looked… more or less… in the 1200s.Both Carcassonne and the Canal du Midi itself are UNESCO World Heritage sites to discourage someone in the future from deciding… again… to tear them down.ConclusionThe region of Canal du Midi is a beautiful place to visit and the luxury hotel barge Enchanté is a particularly enjoyable way to tour it. My thanks to European Waterways, the owners and crew of the Enchanté for treating us in a manner to which we would like to become accustomed.This cruise was sponsored by European Waterways but all opinions are my own.See all my photos from this cruise</aShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/island-running-routes/,7 Exotic Island Running Routes,France,"The #runitfast hashtag has now hit 1.2 million posts on Instagram, so fitness expert Erny Peibst has mapped out running routes for all levels on some roads less travelled. Get away from it all and have a well deserved break, immersing yourself in the beautiful scenery and culture these islands have to offer.From mountain peaks to sandy beaches our planet has some incredible landscapes to explore, so pack your bags and get ready to test your endurance on these exotic islands.1. Running Route on Kauai, HawaiiKnown as the ‘Garden Island’ for its lush vegetation and steady rainfall, running on Kauai gives you an unbelievable opportunity to take in some stunning views of nature.Not only is there remarkable scenery, but along the coast, Kauai is home to white-sand beaches that stretch out into the clear turquoise water of the North Pacific Ocean.Tourists usually stick to the north of the Island, staying in places like Princeville so we’ve mapped out a route that will get you away from the busy tourist traps and allows you to take in all the treasures Kauai has to offer.The route will take you on a scenic 4-mile run along ‘The Coconut Coast’ from Wailua to Kealia. The flat, red clay path stretches along coastal cliffs giving you stunning views of the Pacific on one side and of the island’s vegetation on the other. As you take a leisurely run along the track, you may even catch a glimpse of dolphins or whales in the waters below.2. Running Route on Réunion, near MadagascarThis tiny island off the coast of Madagascar is no bigger than Dorset but rises more than 10,000 ft above the ocean and is the perfect place for any dedicated runner to test their abilities.Home to a truly untouched wilderness, the island was formed from 2 volcanoes (one of which is still active) that have created a heart-stopping natural beauty in the middle of the Indian ocean.The route mapped out starts at the small island village, Piton Sainte-Rose. The coastal town has incredible views and is the perfect place to catch the sunrise if you want to start your run early.The run totals 6.8 miles testing you on a range of terrain and revealing some breathtaking views along the way, not only of the Indian Ocean but then turning inland to the dense island vegetation.About three-quarters of the way around you will also come across an unexpected treasure in the form of Anse Waterfalls. A stunning natural waterfall that climbs 15m high with a crystal clear pool at the bottom – the perfect place for you to stop and catch your breath.*The waterfall is not on the trail and requires a slight detour. When you start to hear the sound of spraying water you will see a signpost for the waterfall with a small track that leads off the trail, take a short jog up and you will be blown away by this natural wonder.Photo by James Donaldson on Unsplash3. Running Route on Palaui, PhilippinesMade up of over 7,000 islands, you could spend months enjoying all of the remote and wondrous running trails the Philippines has to offer.If you only have a short amount of time for your trip then the one place you definitely need to go is Palaui. Located on the northeast tip of Luzon, the island is home to the nation’s capital and an international airport, it is incredibly easy to get to and well worth the 14-hour bus ride.The island is tiny but is home to an almost 6-mile trail called The Lagunzad Trail. The terrain is moderately difficult with some steep climbs up and down mountain peaks but the stunning scenery you get to take in along the route makes those burning climbs well worth it.The island was declared a National Marine Reserve in 1994 and gives you the opportunity to explore many untouched sites from white sand beaches and hidden waterfalls to clifftop views of the Philippine Sea – everything you could want from a running holiday this island has to offer.4. Running Route on Santorini, GreeceOne of the longest and most talked about trails on Santorini goes from Fira to Oia; it’s a steady descent for the entire trail but nothing even an amateur runner couldn’t handle.This is a great trail and really gives you a true taste of the Aegean experience. Starting at a picturesque port in Fira, it continues around the rim of the caldera to Oia on the southern tip of the island, passing through historic sights and Greek towns on the way.The trail takes you along spectacular cliff-tops giving you a stunning view of the sparkling blue Aegean sea that stretches for miles ahead.5. Running Route on Corsica, FranceThe French island of Corsica is home to one of the world’s most spectacular trails, the GR 20 that stretches across 111 miles.The trail winds its way along the jagged center of Corsica’s mountain range. Despite the rugged and mountainous terrain, the trail is within the capabilities of most runners.Your starting point is in Calenzana and the trail goes all the way down to Conca but the section mapped out is just 16 miles and ends in Haut-Asco. This northern part of the trail is great if you just want to go for a run rather than spend days trekking the length of the Island.The entire trail is incredibly well marked with red and white blazes so there is no chance of you getting lost as you run through the breathtaking scenery.6. Running Route on DominicaIf you’ve ever wanted to explore the jungle then Dominica is the place to go for your next ‘runcation.’ No poisonous snakes, no scary spiders, Dominica has some of the friendliest jungle in the world and the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail runs through it all.Segment four of the trail stretches from Wotten Waven to Pont Casse and is a great place to get in your run.The trail is shadowed on either side by an abundance of towering trees, buttress roots and dangling vines. One of the most spectacular waterfalls on the Island, Middleham Falls, is on this segment of the trail, the perfect place to stop and catch your breath or cool off and go for a swim.The terrain is moderately difficult, regular rainfall means you might sometimes find yourself slipping and sliding down hills and the jungle landscape means you will have to watch out for tree roots and branches ready to trip you up as you go.*There is a US$12.00 fee for a day pass to get on the trail.7. Running Route at Grace Bay, Turks, and CaicosIf the jungle isn’t really your thing and you’d rather be running across white sand beaches at sunset then Turks and Caicos is probably the island for you.Home to some of the clearest waters and softest white sand beaches you’re ever likely to find, Grace Bay beach is the crown jewel of the Caribbean.As you run along the beach looking out at the ocean, just a mile offshore you can see the protected reefs through the crystal clear water. The beach itself is always pristine (no rocks, seaweed or pollution in sight) and has been named the most breathtaking destination on the globe.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,France,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "

A welcoming glass of champagne reinforced my pre-travel thoughts, a cruise about wines will be fun. Passengers continued to stream in and settled into chairs and couches in the lounge. I soon realized this homey area was the meeting spot for friends and family with casual conversations flowing as much as the wine.Riquewihr villageA talkative group of about 20 people gathered together near the back and rearranged the furniture to be in communication with each other.  They were members of a California wine club and the owner and winemaker were on board, too.  Curious, I asked our cruise director why a California wine company is on a European wine cruise.  After all, this region of the Rhine is known for excellent wines.  He explained that some wine-themed cruises host a winery from the US to lead discussions about wines and engage the passengers in wine talk.  Wine lovers book the cruises to explore old-world vineyards while swirling and sipping varietals passing by the castles on the Rhine.Oak Farm Vineyards from Lodi, California was the host winery and Dan Panella, the owner, and his winemaker Chad Joseph were ready for the week ahead of grape and fermentation talk.  And wine club member, Rick, was very ready too.  His thirst for wine could not be hidden.  I had to ask him, why European wines and why Lodi, I mean, where is Lodi?  Rick let me know the Wine Spectator named Lodi Wine Region of the Year in 2015.  Cruising the Rhine was sure to be enlightening, if not entertaining.Vineyards in the AlsaceOnce embarked, we headed for the Alsace wine region in southern France and very near Germany.  It is the capital for white wines, especially Rieslings and Gewürztraminers.  Driving through the region, the hillside became noticeably landscaped with perfect rows of vineyards. I could only imagine how many generations of families planted and harvested these grapes through good and bad times.Past the last curve in the road, colorful medieval style homes and small businesses decorated the village of Riquewihr.  Wrapped around cobblestone streets, which dipped into the village, surely this is what postcards are made of. The area has been influenced by France and Germany since both countries ruled at different times over the centuries.  German-sounding names and French macaroon stores dotted the main street.Alsace winery Dopff Au Moulin, has been family owned since 1574, and produces different varieties of white wines.  A tradition began during the second German Empire (1871-1918), of eating locally made Kugelhopf cake while drinking Gewürztraminer wine.  Still to this day, when attending a special event, a welcoming gesture is to offer a glass of wine and a slice of cake. And that’s exactly what we did in this tasting room. Interestingly, the cake, resembling a bundt cake, is not too sweet and pairs well with the sweet wine.Dopff Au Moulin wineryI asked if the cake was made on-premises and he whispered, up the street is the bakery.  My nose found the bakery and cakes were in the oven and finished baking as I stood watching.  With or without wine, the aroma was intoxicating to me.  The baker carefully handled the hot cake pans and finished each one with a dusting of powdered sugar.Kugelhopf cakes in Alsace regionSurely, it wouldn’t be France without macaroons and the bakery’s window display of the little colorful round cookies, stacked in the shape of a Christmas tree was eye-catching.  Add the sound of the cork popping from local bubbly Brut and my paradise was found.As all good things come to an end, our Captain’s farewell dinner featured AMA’s Chaine des Rotisseurs menu. The ship is a member of this prestigious culinary society and thoughtfully paired Oak Farms Wine with each course.  I particularly enjoyed the Foie Gras and walnut brioche with California’s Albarino wine. Mr. Joseph explained high acid content in the wine cuts the high fat content of the foie gras.Colorful Macaroons at Maison Alsacienne de BiscuiterieProven once again, be it old world or new world wines, the simple things in life are the best. Good food and wine shared with family and friends is the ultimate pairing.When I returned home, I pulled out my German bundt cake pan and chilled a bottle of French white wine.  My arriving guests would be welcomed in a new way now.This recipe for Alsace Kugelhopf cake is compliments of AMAWaterwaysALSACE GUGELHUPF (BUNDT CAKES)INGREDIENTS5 oz. golden raisins1.5 oz. candied orange peel pre-soaked in rum2 cups flour2.5 oz. sugar3/4 stick butter2 tsp. salt3 eggs1 tsp. vanilla or lemon extract1 cup whole milk1 oz. yeastPREPARATION METHODPlace all ingredients, except for the orange peel and raisins, into a mixing bowl and stir until the texture is smooth.

https://amateurtraveler.com/8-ways-to-enjoy-paris-on-a-budget/,Paris on a Budget – 9 Inexpensive Ways to Enjoy The City of Lights,France,"You were meant to visit Paris, France. You know it, and I know it – so, what’s stopping you from going? Please don’t tell me that it’s your budget because I know eight simple tips from my own experience that will save you a fortune in this magical city that no one ever forgets. Here’s how you can enjoy the international capital of art, romance, fashion and fine desserts just a little longer on a shoestring budget:1. Pack light so that you can take the train – everywhere. You’ll thank me for this.When you’ve just arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport and head out to Paris, nothing is cheaper and faster than the train; plus, you don’t need to know French to understand it either. However, don’t even think about lugging a fat suitcase through the train station unless you don’t mind encountering the turnstiles from Hell. These turnstiles are exceedingly narrow, to begin with, and they give you the distinct impression that they are supposed to keep more people out than invite them in. Even if you manage to squeeze yourself through it with your bags like the last bit of toothpaste in a tube, you’ll lose any shred of esteem that your onlookers may have had when they first saw you. Therefore, a backpack or small carry-on suitcase on wheels, which you can easily lift, is essential here.2. Once you’re in the city, meet your new best friend: the Paris metro train system.At any metro station, ask for week-long, discounted passes with unlimited rides all day. Paris has even more metro stops than New York City, making it extremely convenient to get around. The metro is very easy to use, and you’ll need to use it because everyone in the city gives directions according to the metro stops anyway. The unlimited-rides feature of these metro passes will be your saving grace when you will inevitably get lost after discovering that one Parisian intersection can connect up to six streets due to those “magnifique” roundabouts — the American’s Rubik’s Cube of traffic obstacles.Just be aware that the subways do stop running after 12:40 a.m. on weekdays or 1:40 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays — and by all means, enjoy the ride. Local Parisians on the train are fascinating and unpredictable; they may suddenly start staring at your face and sketching it in a book if you look interesting enough, and they especially love to kiss each other in any public location at any time without embarrassment. If you don’t know any French, all you need to remember is that “sortie” is the exit. Otherwise, you’ll never find your way out of the stations filled with vending machines selling Toblerone bars, wandering musicians with accordions and ladies in stiletto heels and blue jeans madly crossing paths in the colorfully tiled tunnels.[Editor’s note: Watch your wallet or purse on the subway. On our first trip to Paris a friend was pickpocketed in the first 15 minutes in the city in the subway.]You might be wondering, “What about the bus system?”I did, but unless you know French, just don’t bother. You can get around, but it’s a serious test of patience and navigation skills for many non-French speakers. Worsening the situation is the fact that a great majority of Parisians find nothing more annoying than a lost American in Paris who can’t speak French. You’ll want to avoid asking questions until you’re really desperate, and then you should only ask hotel-desk employees for directions if you want a complete answer in English.A newer option to get around these days is renting a bicycle.You can subscribe to the local bicycle service, and then you just pick up or drop off your bicycle at more than 1,000 bicycle service stations in and around Paris! However, bicycles aren’t recommended unless you’re staying in the city for more than a week because you’ll find so many enticing little places to stop – everywhere you go — that walking just makes more sense. Besides, the subway gets you across long distances more quickly and efficiently when that’s what you need.3. Stay at a hostel.Don’t worry; they’re clean, safe and affordable. Parisian hotels are pricey because Paris is the ninth-most expensive city in the world, according to The Telegraph in 2015. The other added value of hostels is that they let you meet the most interesting, friendly people who can share their own travel tips with you. Nothing beats a potluck dinner with your hostel mates in the shared kitchen to taste the best of your food findings from around the city.4. Savor high-class street food.Eat pizzas and pastries – which are some of the best – from sidewalk delis that are inexpensive and require no spoken French to order from. Just point out what you want; the “point and serve” philosophy never fails. You can’t go wrong anywhere since the French are famous for their high standards when it comes to food. All of their chocolates make American sweets look like lifeless bits of sugar, and you can say the same for all their pastries.5. Buy boxed wine from the local supermarkets.Yes, you may feel that no good-tasting wine could possibly come in something that looks like an over-sized juice box container, but it’s the best-tasting wine for your newly exchanged dollars in town. The French would feel too embarrassed to sell anything that tastes cheap – even cheap wine.6. See the city on foot at night – It’s free and exquisite.Paris is at her finest after sunset. That’s when even her Eiffel Tower really comes alive with a special glow that takes you back in time to bygone eras of mythical vampires, blood-thirsty revolutionaries, poets, and kings. The distances between main attractions are easy and enjoyable to walk between. In fact, you could easily check out several sights like the Notre Dame cathedral, Arc de Triomphe or Eiffel Tower all in one evening. These attractions are all free — unless you wait in a huge line to buy an elevator ticket to the top of the Eiffel Tower.7. Don’t change money near the biggest tourist attractions.Exchange rates are generally terrible in these places. Unless you have a special credit card with travel benefits like no fees for overseas charges, just take out what you need in advance from the ATM to pay for everything in cash. Visa cards and Mastercards are the best – Amex cards aren’t accepted everywhere, so leave those at home.8. Skip The Louvre to see Chateau de Versailles instead.The most valuable thing a local Parisian ever told me was that “The Chateau de Versailles is the only thing you really have to see,” and I’m glad I listened. Only art buffs should see The Louvre because entry tickets are expensive, and it would take a good week to really see it all. Plus, the Mona Lisa is actually a small painting that you can’t even get really close to.However, Chateau de Versailles is a truly awe-inspiring palace that belonged to the most famous French monarchs. You can cover the highlights of it within one day, and it’s not so expensive. Just take a quick train ride out of the city and spend a few hours going back in time as you roam the grand grounds where Napoleon and King Louis lived with their mistresses and admirers from the court. The architecture and gardens with fountains large enough to sail a ship on are something to marvel at. The whole scene is a phantasmic escape into a place set apart from time where men either believed they were gods or servants of gods, and these gods could never get enough of anything – until bloodthirsty revolutionaries stormed the palace and chopped off their heads.To this day, Paris still feels like a hub of rebellious bohemians who mix passionate decadence with the timeless ideals of a stubborn patriotism, and they’re all dancing around the remains of historical riches that carry the whispers of romance and broken hearts on the chilly night air. Therefore, I urge you to take my advice and soak up this city — which doesn’t have even one dull block in it between the independently owned street cafes, bakeries, artists, wild musicians, and couture shops – because, yes, you can afford it. Plus, your first bite of a French chocolate truffle with a glass of wine will make you glad you came.9. Walk the St Martin’s CanalEditor: I love this little corner of Paris that most tourists don’t get to. The St Martin’s Canal is an old barge canal that cuts through Paris to the Seine. I first learned about it in a walking tour in the Eyewitness Travel Guide to France. While walking along the canal I saw this couple sitting by one of the locks. When I am old, if all goes well you will find me sitting here with my wife. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-dining-paris-tom-reeves/,Book Review – Dining Out in Paris by Tom Reeves,France,"Review of Dining Out in Paris: What You Need to Know before You Get to the City of Light, by Tom Reeves. Available as an e-book from Amazon. Tom can be reached at www.discoverparis.net.We’ve been to Paris many times, but we sure could have used a book like this before our first trip. Tom Reeves explains the way restaurants work in France, from the requirement that they display the menu (in our meaning of the word) for any passing diner, to the slow pace of service, which seems like bad service to pressed-for-time Americans, but is not meant that way at all. He also explains the three typical courses, and how what we call an entrée is a main course in France, with the starter or appetizer being called an entrée.He also gives a rundown on ‘foreign’ (meaning not French cuisine) restaurants, and on the smoking ban which has been in effect since 2008. My experience is that the smoking ban has just made outdoor dining less pleasant – the smokers have moved to the outside tables – but at least you can breathe indoors, which didn’t used to be the case. The fine for smoking is €68, which is hefty, but nothing compared to the fine in Ireland, €3000.Another really interesting thing is the explanation of the differences among the different types of eating establishments, and the origins of the names. For example, ‘bistro’, which sounds so French, came from Russian soldiers, stationed in Paris after Napoleon’s defeat, who wanted their booze served faster and would yell ‘Bystro! Bystro!’ which means quick in Russian. There is also a good explanation of the different kinds of food shops, the difference between a boulangerie and a patisserie, and the various other food establishments. Browsing in grocery stores in a different country is always interesting – but in France everything looks so good.Our typical approach to dining in Paris is to find a recommended restaurant in the Rick Steves guide. I have to think Rick Steves has not been to any of the top twelve restaurants that Tom Reeves reviewed in detail for Dining Out in Paris.   I had not heard of any of them, and most I would be hard pressed to find. But we’re going to Paris soon, and we’re going to try a few. This book contains the most detailed restaurant review information you can find, except perhaps in a major metropolitan newspaper, and not often there.For each restaurant, Tom Reeves includes a color photo of the exterior – what a good idea that is, for someone trying to find a place for the first time. Take your e-reader with you and show someone the picture if you still can’t find the restaurant. He has color photos of the proprietors and/or chefs, and provides some details about who they are and how they came to be in the restaurant business. He even reviewed a food truck! For each establishment, there are detailed summaries of prices for drinks, appetizers, main courses, desserts, and an indication of the least expensive wine option. Very detailed descriptions of the food are done for each restaurant. The dozen restaurants have anything from traditional French cuisine to Brazilian fusion to African to vegetarian and vegan. My wife is a vegetarian, and while nowadays she can usually find something in any restaurant in Paris, even if it means having an entrée as a plat principal, it is a treat for her to have a multitude of options. We know of one vegan restaurant (Le Potager du Marais – on Facebook but website under construction) but now we know of another, Café Ginger. It looks like a lunch place but we’ll check it out. It’s close to Bastille metro. Another of interest is La Table de Botzaris,  in a part of Paris where we’ve never been, but it looks like it might interest a vegetarian, at least for the starters.For each restaurant, Tom includes their days and hours of operation, closest metro station, when they close for vacation, their website, phone, and other useful information, such as what credit cards are accepted.This book is recommended for first-time visitors to Paris, and to repeat visitors who want to expand their culinary horizons, and explore some Metro lines they would not normally take. I’m looking forward to using it in the city soon.Disclaimer: A free copy of this book was given to Jim with the expectation that a fair and honest review would be written of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-well-always-paris-jennifer-coburn/,Book Review: “We’ll Always Have Paris” by Jennifer Coburn,France,"We’ll Always Have Paris, A Mother/Daughter Memoir, by Jennifer Coburn was a breeze to read with a scattering of amusing passages similar to Bill Bryson’s travel antics.  Coburn invites us to read her whimsical tales of adventures in Western Europe as a phobic mother who is afraid of a premature death and her underage, yet wise and level headed, daughter, Katie.  Through their forays, Katie ages into young adulthood and her mother relaxes and is able to cherish their exploring time together.While reading We’ll Always have Paris, I forgot I was reading a memoir.  Coburn writes with blatant honesty and comically factual relatable scenarios.  In the midst of a travel story, Coburn frequently interrupts the experiences, with corresponding flashbacks from her childhood of her non-traditional upbringing in NYC with days spent with her pot smoking loveable dad and her moving on up in the world mom.  It’s through these recollections that we understand why Coburn makes the time to travel cautiously or footloose and fancy free with her daughter.She did research before embarking and accepted advice and suggestions from friends, family and colleagues as to what are must views, good delicacies and how to travel on the train.  Her resourcefulness in finding cheaper admission rates could be seen as immoral or ingenious.  Overseas traveling, in which neither parent nor daughter contain fluent knowledge of the local language, could be argued a life lesson or lost marbles.  Coburn invents wonderful descriptive nick names for the people they encounter pertaining to their situations, like Too Friendly David or Quasimodo.  They secured an evening at Shakespeare and Co. with Katie’s bold comments and accepted a feast from a local restaurateur for less than cost of the meal, because he wanted them to have a good memory of the city. Through views of numerous cathedrals, architectural buildings and art museums, Katie and Jennifer discovered numerous artists with “wacky” and perhaps, Gaudi, styles.  They were influenced and amazed at the kindness of welcoming and helpful strangers.  In true traveler fashion, these two ladies devised their own “you had to be there” language, conversational style and dialogue.As I’ve been ridiculously fortunate to fulfill a dream of traveling through Europe, I related to and remembered many of my experiences with great amusement that Coburn presented.  My travel partner was not my mother, but my younger sister, who finished a college semester in one of the cities, Seville, where Coburn traveled with her daughter.  To have travel experiences are magical.  To be able to share treks with loved ones is stupendous.  To walk a path where ancestors walked is inspirational.  I love my mom, and Mother’s Day was recent, but there’s no way I could travel internationally with her; I’ll stick to shorter adventures with her at the thrift stores.  I give Coburn credit for being brave and creating memories with her daughter.  Pick up this book if you have any desire to travel with your child.  Be prepared to be inspired to begin planning your own adventure!Disclosure: A free copy of this book was given to the volunteer with the expectation that a fair and honest review would be written of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/french-dream-travelling-corsica-ile-de-beaute/,A French Dream – Travelling to Corsica – Ile de Beauté,France,"Homecoming- that warm feeling and a desire to feel that feel again is probably what a quest for travel is all about. We travel to discover who we are and where we belong to and it is not necessarily the country you were born in. You can belong to any part of the globe, any place that you can call home. This ‘home’ for me was Corsica, a small French island, situated between the French and Italian mainland.I first read about Corsica in a short story named Happiness, by he celebrated French author Guy de Maupassant. As a 15 year old, the love story had a special impact on me and since then, Corsica became a safe haven of love and dreams. It so happened that almost after nine years I applied for a program called Assistants de langue étrangère, under which I supposed to go to France and teach English to little French kids. The destination city was to be decided by the French Embassy. As luck would have it, I was placed in Corsica, the island I used to dream about since I was 15 years old. This island became my home for 7 months.Definitely one of the most beautiful places on Earth, Corsica is a lot more than just natural beauty. It’s the rugged history of the island give it the peculiar nature. Though the island is now one of the communes of France, it has distinctly preserved its own culture, language, and food.Ajaccio and Bastia are the two largest cities on the island. Rest are all small towns and villages. Ajaccio happens to be the hometown of Napoleon Bonaparte. Other notable towns are- St Florent, Calvi, Porto, Porto Vecchio, Bonifacio, Corte etc. A single mountain range runs through the length of the island, making one of the world’s most adventurous hiking trails, the GR20.The Northern tip of the island is called the Cap Corse, as it forms a ‘cap’ over the island (called Corse in French and Corsican). The savage Mediterranean jewel is home to a number of wild animals and exotic birds; as a result, there are a number of Natural Reserves all across the island. Many of the beaches are other sites have been listed as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.One of the most exhilarating things to do in Corsica is to see the sea from a mountaintop. This isn’t too difficult. Climb up anywhere along the Cap Corse, and you have the perfect combination of the mountains and the sea. One of the easiest trails is from Maccinagio, the last village on the eastern side of the island on the Cap Corse, a 2-hour drive away from Bastia. Within a walk of 45 minutes, you are happily perched on a hilltop, approximately 50 feet above the sea.Another remarkable town is Bonifacio, which happens to be on the southernmost tip of the island. From here, on a clear summer day, you can easily see the Italian island Sardinia. Bonifacio is special for its location and geographical features. The town is precariously situated on a huge mass of white rock. The effect is even more splendid when the white rock contrasts with turquoise and blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The surrounding waters are home to many small caves and creeks, which make for some of the most gorgeous sceneries. A specific creek is of particular interest as the opening to this creek is in the shape of Corsica. I know it sounds incredible and may be a little hard to believe, but you’ve got to see it to believe it!Yet another interesting place to spend an evening is Ile Sanguinaires, reachable by a 40-minute bus ride from Ajaccio. The archipelago can successfully offer you one of the most pristine sunsets you’ve witnessed in your life. At Ile Sanguinaires, you just need to be with yourself, against the backdrop of sun simmering down in the Mediterranean Sea and dolphins.Many other villages dotted all across the island happily tell the folktales of battles and loved ones lost. The entire island has a sort of savageness to it, which makes you feel closer to nature. The rustic old houses in Sartene will make you forget the fancy cottages in Scotland and the narrow, winding roads will make you forget the fancily constructed highways.You won’t be lost even if you don’t know where you’re going when in Corsica. The Corsican summers are packed with tourists, mainly from Europe, some from the UK, and few from other countries. The best part about Corsica is that that it is still unharmed by ruthless commercialisation. The people are still simple and won’t try to rob you at the next possible chance. I was welcomed with a warm heart by Corsica and its residents, and i am sure that if you dare to explore this ferocious beauty, you will be welcomed too.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/following-in-the-footsteps-of-van-gogh/,"Following in the Footsteps of Van Gogh – Auvers-sur-Oise, France",France,"Auvers-sur-OiseOn a chilly winter day, my husband and I took a day trip to Auvers-sur-Oise a small village northwest of Paris. The one hour train ride from Gare du Nord was convenient and an opportunity to see Paris suburbs and countryside. This quaint little village is best known as the last home of Vincent van Gogh and the final resting place for him and his brother Theodore.Not sure what amenities we would find open in the winter and on a Sunday we picked up some provisions before boarding the train. The Auvers-sur-Oise stop was a very cool little depot on the edge of town.Upon arriving we walked through a short tunnel under the platform to the other side of the tracks and into the town. This entire tunnel was brightly painted in murals, and it made a memorable entrance to what would become one of my favorite destinations. Thanks to preservation efforts by the French government very few changes have been made to the town and surrounding countryside since van Gogh’s time over a hundred years ago.Although some of the museums and restaurants were closed we were not disappointed in the least. Our first stop was the Office of Tourism. They offered a lot of information about the town and have a small art exhibit and gift shop. They also have a nice restroom on the ground floor that is open even when the shop is closed.Self-Guided Walking TourThey were very helpful and gave us a self-guided walking tour map. The tour provided points of interest in the town and the countryside and identified locations van Gogh painted. At each site, there is a kiosk with a copy of his original painting and right behind it is the actual scene he painted. It was truly remarkable to see how little it had changed and to see how the great painter had interpreted it.We began our tour with a stop at AubergeRavoux Inn. This is where van Gogh lived while in Auvers-sur-Oise and where he died. It is now a restaurant. Unfortunately, it was closed on the day we were there, so we were unable to tour the upstairs room #5 where van Gogh lived and died.Another stop on the tour was the location where he painted “The Town Hall at Auvers”, “The Town Hall was remarkably similar to the painting. The only thing the real building lacked were the flags celebrating Bastille Day. The stanchions and chains in the painting remain but are not visible in the photograph due to the Christmas village display on the right.The Church of Auvers-Sur-Oise painting site was another breathtaking view. Only the vegetation has changed. The Church painting was so similar to the real thing that it could have been painted yesterday. The 13th-century church was open and we were able to tour the inside. It was lovely and even on a cloudy day, the stained glass was beautiful.My favorite location on the walk was the wheat fields. The “Wheat Fields with Crows” painting evokes the same feeling as actually standing in the wheat field. It is a majestic view of open space and on that day there were several crows flying overhead. It was easy to envision van Gogh walking across the fields with a canvas and his oil paints in hand. It was a treat to have so much beautiful land to walk on.A trip to Auvers-sur-Oise would not be complete without a visit to the cemetery and the graves of Vincent and Theodore. A winding unpaved road next to a crop field leads to the cemetery on top of a hill. The French flag flies above and a stone wall encompasses the cemetery. There is a sign that points to the van Gogh graves. Simple headstones and graves covered in ivy make for a peaceful final resting place. Someone had placed a sunflower on the graves the day we were there.Van Gogh spent approximately 70 days in Auvers-sur-Oise from May to July 1890. During this short time, he prolifically painted 70 paintings. Other artists such as Cezanne, Daubigny, Pissarro, Rousseau found inspiration in the hypnotic beauty of this quaint village. It continues to be a popular destination for painters and photographers. During the tourist season from April to October many events and festivals are offered. It is home to The Painters Festival, a Music Festival and an Iris Festival.Our visit was perfect. Even on a cold blustery day, the place was enchanting. There were no crowds to contend with and the self-guided tour provided an excellent experience. The restaurant and bakeries were outstanding as expected in France. Our next trip will be to attend one of the festivals in the summer. Auvers-sur-Oise is a great day trip.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/15-odd-facts-about-france/,15 Odd Facts About France,France,"TouristsFrance is the most visited country in the world with over 79.5 million guests in 2011. A number of those visitors are from its neighbors in Europe but people all over the world are drawn to the culture, history, art and of course the food of this popular country.CheeseRoquefort, Raclette, Camembert, Port Salut, Brie, Munster, and Neufchâtel, are all popular French Cheeses but they are only the tip of the cheese iceberg in France which boasts 350-400 different types of cheese. Just think you could have a different cheese each day of the year.FrenchWhile English may have become the, now ironically named, Lingua Franca of the world French is still an official language in the UE, the EU, as well as in the International Red Cross, the International Labor Organization, Amnesty International, and Doctors without Borders.InventionsYou may know that the hot-air balloon, photography (Daguerreotypes), the Concorde and the bicycle were invented in France, but did you know that the French also brought us Velcro, the oboe, Etch a Sketch, modern dentistry, asperin, neon lights, the modern bra and roulette.ElementsFrench chemists discovered Hydrogen, Beryllium, Chromium, Gallium , Fluorine , Europium , Polonium, Radium and Oxygen.Canned FoodsThe French are known for their love of fresh and seasonal food but it was a frenchman who actually invented preserving food via “canning”. Nicolas Appert won a 12,000 franc prize offered by the French military for this discovery. The military needed preserved foods to feed the huge armies of Napoleon. Appert did not use cans but glass containers including Champagne bottles.Not FrenchNone of French fries, french toast and croissants were invented in France. (The croissant was invented in Vienna to celebrate a defeat of the Ottoman Turks).L’Académie françaiseUnlike English there is an official version of French decided by the L’Académie française. It was started by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635. The 40 members of the academy tend to recommend french words instead of often more popular English words. For instance, they recommend logiciel instead of software and courriel instead of email. mot-dièse instead of hashtag, entraineur instead of coach, passer une audition instead of casting. Appointment to the academy is for life and its members are sometimes known as “immortals”.SexAccording to the Durex Global Sex Survey 2004, the French have more sex in a given year than anyone else. The average French person will have sex 137 times a year, the average American 111 times and the world average 103 times (in Japan the average is 46 times).Eiffel TowerYou can’t legally take a picture of the Eiffel tower at night and then publish it. According to the official Eiffel Tower website “Permission and rights must be obtained from the “Société d’Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel” for the publication of photos of the illuminated Eiffel Tower.”When the tower was first erected, many if not most Parisians hated it and thought it was ugly. It was originally supposed to be temporary (20 years), but Eiffel, rather brilliantly, made the tower useful to the government by installing radio transmitters. Radio jammers on the tower may have slowed the German advance in WWI.CastlesThere are thousands of castles, or chateaus, in France, perhaps as many as 20,000. The Loire Valley is the best known region for castles and palaces but castles, walled towns and palaces can be found all over the country.BikiniThe two piece bathing suit that we now call the Bikini was invented by two French designers in the same year. Jacques Heim called his suit “l’Atome”, but despite being first designer Louis Reard’s “Bikini”. He supposedly named the atom-sized suit after the recent atomic testing the Bikini Atol.TypingFrench typists can use the phrase “Allez porter ce vieux whisky au juge blond qui fume un havane.” to warm up as it contains every letter in the alphabet. The phrase means “Take this whisky to the blond judge who is smoking a cigar.”Bastille DayThe French celebrate July 14th, Bastille Day, as Americans celebrate July 4th. It commemorates the storming of a notorious prison by crowds of Parisians and marked the start of the downfall of the power of the king during the French Revolution. You would think that since the French still celebrate Bastille Day that the old prison was full of political prisoners freed by the mobs, but on the day it was stormed there were only 7 prisoners and 4 of them were there because of check forging.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/4-terrifying-places-in-europe/,4 Scariest Places in Europe,France,"People always tend to go on and on about the hundreds of marvelous destinations as well as the many romantic getaways ideal for a holiday with your beloved one. However, since I’m more of a solo traveler, I love to travel alone, so these romantic places are of pretty much no interest for me. On the other hand, being an avid backpacker, I’ve pretty much covered all the places that are worth visiting in my home Europe. That is why, I started thinking about something along the lines of the unusual. Not the average traveling ideas you can find in all guidebooks. And then, I finally got it! Since I’m going to be on my own, why not find some places where I can be scared out of my wits?I’m usually into extraordinary types of adventures and, being a big fan of horror movies, consider myself not easily scared. That is what actually made me embark on a journey to visit the top four most terrifying places in Europe. However, note that some of the places are not particularly scary. What actually makes them give you chills down the spine is the mystery and legends they are shrouded in.1. Catacombs of ParisI decided the first stop of my horror journey to be France and to gradually advance east. That’s why my first destination was the Catacombs of Paris. Filled with genuine human skulls and bones, the Catacombs have been created in the eighteenth century. It is basically situated under the city center streets. I had been to Paris before but never have I given it much of a thought what is there under my feet.What led to the ‘building’ of the Catacombs is the fact that the Parisian cemetery that had been used for nearly ten centuries became a source of infection and got many people seriously sick. Therefore, in 1786 the removal of the bones was performed.Nowadays, the Catacombs are an alternative tourist attraction where you can walk around the maze-like corridors along with the remains of about six million Parisians. I definitely found the place worth the visit, especially if you have nerves of steel and the sight of millions of human bones doesn’t make you nauseated.2. AuschwitzNow, the next one really made me shiver. The Auschwitz concentration camp. We have all seen movies about World War II and archive footage of the so-called ‘camps of death’, but experiencing everything firsthand gives you a whole different feeling than watching it on film.The Auschwitz concentration camp is situated in Southern Poland. It consists of hundreds of wood-houses where, during the Second World War, German Nazis would keep hundreds of thousands of Jews, gypsies and others who they considered ‘inferior’.Walking around these places, where people literally starved and toiled to death gave me a feeling I had never experienced before. The grimmest one you can imagine. Millions of people were executed in these camps. Those interested can now enter the grounds of the camp and, while following an expert guide, explore this terrifying place. I took advantage of that opportunity, and I strongly advise you to do so, too, because having a guide contributes to the better understanding of what had been happening there. The very thought of it can scare you stiff.3. Bran CastleBran Castle is one of the places I had in mind when mentioning sites that are shrouded in mystery and legends. Located in the Transylvania province in Central Romania, near the city of Brasov, the Bran Castle is known to have been home to the infamous Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula. Now, this is something that cannot be proved for sure, but it is widely claimed.This historic figure made famous by Bram Stoker’s novel is known to have been very strict and to have impaled criminals for even the smallest felony. This led to the belief that he was blood-thirsty and that is why he was portrayed the way he was in the aforementioned novel.Precisely because of these legends, I literally consider the castle to be one of the creepiest places one can visit. Especially if you have seen the movie or have read the novel, like myself, you will constantly look behind your back scared that a vampire might appear silently from one of the dark and narrow passages. As if century-old castles aren’t spooky enough in the first place.4. PrypiatThe last site is really different from all the rest and quite unusual. Not a specific ‘attraction’ but rather a whole town, Prypiat is an abandoned town, the one which is closest to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It has been uninhabited since 1986 when the Nuclear Disaster took place. Prypiat used to be home to the hundreds of workers and scientists that worked in the factory. However, due to the extremely high levels of radioactivity, all people were moved from the town.Nowadays, the levels of radioactivity have dropped significantly in comparison to 1986, and the place is basically safe to visit, but with a guide. Since I was on my own, I had to join a group of fellow travelers in order to be able to visit the radioactive ground. After the Chernobyl disaster, Prypiat was cleared of its inhabitants, everything was left intact and up to this day stays where it has been once left – household furniture, everyday items, even the nursery’s beds, and an amusement park’s bumper cars and Ferris wheel are still there. I felt like an intruder in some ghost town. The feeling of the place being haunted is extreme.So next time you feel adventurous, why not test your courage by visiting one of these, instead of climbing a mountain? If you have the guts, that is.You can read more from Grace at http://www.vacation-rentals.com/.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-taking-root-in-provence-by-anne-marie-simons/,Book Review – “Taking Root in Provence” by Anne-Marie Simons,France,"I reviewed Taking Root in Provence, by Anne-Marie Simons. This book is a happy little account of a multi-cultural couple who, when it came time for early retirement, decided to find a place in Europe to settle down, and made their home in Aix-en-Provence, in Southern France. The author is Dutch by ancestry, though from what I could tell, spent most of her life in the United States. Her husband and travel buddy, Oscar, is Argentinian by descent, but also from the U.S.The above statements I make about this couple may or may not be true. The fact is that the author didn’t give me enough background information about herself or her husband to make me care that much about them as characters in her book. Where were they from? Where did they grow up? How did they meet? Do they have kids? What were their professions? Where were they living before they retired? She made passing mention of having lived in Washington in one of the first few chapters, but I didn’t know which Washington she was referring to; then in the next chapter, she clarified — Washington, D.C. This kind of detail is important for readers since the two “Washingtons” couldn’t be more different culturally, environmentally, and climatically. And depending on where people come from, you can get a sense of what they are like, which makes reading what they write more interesting.The book is very factual, but with an observational tone, of the day after day and season after season life and activities of living in Provence for two retirees from the United States. My guess is that they must have made quite a bit of money in order to stop working so early in life, and then move to Europe full time. That fact also makes them somewhat hard to relate to. I’m speaking only from my own perspective, as a 30-something who also loves to travel; I scrape together enough money only every few years for an adventure, and STILL haven’t been able to see very much of Europe at all, because Europe is expensive. If there was some discussion in the book that made this couple easier to relate to, such as how they make it work financially – what they had to sacrifice, how lucky they feel to be able to live this way, the challenges and worries of meeting bills or the planning that went into having this European lifestyle – I would have paid more attention. Again, these are the personal touches that might have set me up to care more and enjoy the story.It’s not that this book isn’t a pleasant narration of their lives in Provence, because it is very sweet and positive and, at times, cute. But it reads like a long letter home to someone she knows very well, and there isn’t enough background information in it about her or anyone she talks about to make me interested in what they buy at the market on Saturdays or the rosé they drink with leisurely lunches in the summertime right before their naps, or the summer festivals with long French names and descriptions.A little dialogue would have also gone a long way to make this book more interesting. The author’s writing style is pleasant enough, but it would be much more engaging and interesting if I knew her personally, or if she included some conversation. But there weren’t enough juicy details or personal stories to appeal to me as a reader. In addition, she jumps around in confusing ways, starting a paragraph with a description of an event or a place — the climate of Provence for example — and then dives into a complete non sequitur, like health care, in the next. In all honesty I started this book six months ago, and was only after a nudge from my friend Chris Christensen at The Amateur Traveler, that I was able to finish, and write the review I promised him.The author’s descriptions of countryside and meals and wine and local government ordinances read like a geography textbook or a chattering friend after her vacation in France. In a few places, the author would tell a “story” that made things suddenly interesting. One was about rooftop chimneys and illegal construction additions in Aix (mostly for student housing, as Aix-en-Provence is a college town). When the author lit a fire in her fireplace, the unintended result was mystery smoke pouring into a student’s upstairs apartment two houses away. There weren’t enough of those types of events in the book — describing a potentially dangerous or interesting situation that was a direct result of culturally lax attitude towards construction ordinances or the challenges of maintaining old buildings.There is nothing inherently bad about her book, but without having been to the areas she describes, I need a bit more to go on. I need emotional reactions to predicaments or furrowed brows over language confusion; I need to read how they adjusted physically to both a change in daily routine (retired life vs. going to work each day) and a change in environment. Basically, I needed to invest more in the author and her characters emotionally in order to find them, and their lives in Provence, interesting.I don’t want to say anything negative about a fellow travel enthusiast; memoirs and experiences are so personal that to criticize them feels unfair. That said, I was asked to “review” this book, and so to say that I liked it would be a lie. The author just didn’t set the stage well enough for me to care about her and her husband, or their friends, their stories, or their lives. If a bit more of her personality and social interactions came through, I think I would have found this book to be really enjoyable.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/dijon-france-a-wise-destination/,"Dijon, France – What to Do, See and Eat",France,"Mustard, but MoreDijon.  You’re thinking mustard, aren’t you?  But there is so much more to this French provincial city than the spicy stuff.  Beyond the Musee de la Moutard (Museum of Mustard), the capital of Burgundy is almost like a mini Paris, dotted with elegant boutiques, aromatic bistros, pampered pooches, and medieval buildings.What to SeeFor a little taste of Dijon’s delights follow the Owl’s Trail (Parcours de la Chouette).  The cute triangular owl tiles embedded into Dijon’s footpaths lead you to Dijon’s top 22 attractions with the accompanying brochure available from the Tourist Office.If you’re short on time, it’s a great way to ‘tick off’ Dijon’s must-sees, but if you linger a while you’ll be rewarded with fascinating glimpses of history, stunning architecture, unique shopping and a delectable treat or two.  As a bonus, families traveling with children will enjoy a rare opportunity to visit boring old buildings in peace with the kids only too happy to find the next stop by spotting another owl tile.Along the way, you’ll discover the Dukes’ Palace which despite its warrior history is a work of art in its own right but now also houses the Museum of Fine Art.   The cobbled laneways are dotted with shops selling everything from chain store fashions right through to antiques, and if you happen to find yourself at Les Halles (the market) on a Tuesday or Friday, expect a feast for the eyes as well as all the gorgeous fresh produce its purveyors are so rightly proud of.What to EatBy now, you’re probably ready to pause and take in the tranquillity of the Botanical Gardens, the Jardin de l’Arquebuse and then boost the energy levels with a sugar fix from Le Rose de Vergy gingerbread shop.The Porte Guillaume on Place Darcy will probably remind you a lot of the Arc de Triomphe and just like Paris, Dijon has its very own Notre Dame church, this one crawling with mean-looking gargoyles.  Built in the early 1200s, it also supposedly has a small stone owl carved into one of its corners.  Stroke this owl and, superstition has it, you will be granted wisdom and happiness.  I say the owl is supposedly there because, clearly in need of the wisdom it bestows, we weren’t clever enough to spot it.What to DrinkWe may have missed out on the wisdom part but Dijon yielded more than enough happiness, thanks in no small part to its proximity to the vineyards of the Routes Des Grand Cru and the world-famous Burgundy wines it produces.Nevertheless, I feel obliged to continue my pursuit of wisdom, particularly if it involves the ongoing consumption of delicate patisserie and the occasional sip of a Grand Cru wine along the way.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/expat-life-finding-a-home-in-italy-and-france/,Expat Life: Finding a Home in Italy and France,France,"I’ve been an expat since 2002 when, armed with a year of self-taught Italian, I moved from New York to Rome, Italy – alone – two days after breaking up with my boyfriend of seven years. When I arrived I knew exactly one person: an Italian guy named Marco who ran the Internet café I had decided to work from. And when I say “knew,” I mean I had met him while on a trip there the previous year, asked about a monthly rate, and written him a letter in broken Italian to say I’d be returning soon as a regular customer.For whatever reason, Marco decided to become my friend and in the easy, generous way it seems Italians have honed to an art form, so did all of his friends. Within a year of living in Rome I was dreaming in Italian and spent days on end never speaking, or hearing, a word of English. But more importantly, 4,000 miles from “home,” I had found a real sense of belonging – not only to my group of friends, but to the Italian culture as a whole. In short, when in Rome I most certainly do what the Romans do.Understandably, this assimilation defined my experience. On a personal level, let me just say this – if you ever break up with someone, immediately move to a foreign country alone. The sheer effort it took for me to get through each day left me with little time or energy to think about the breakup. What I remember most from those initial months was not heartache or sorrow, but figuring out how the washing machine worked and winning over the cheese lady at the weekly market and hundreds of other small victories that made me feel like a combination of MacGyver and Rosie the Riveter.On a cultural level, nothing is better for assimilation than being surrounded by really cool people you’re dying to get to know better. I could have reached out to the expat community in Rome, but the thrill of understanding, and being understood by, my amazing friends was addictive. I gladly let them teach me not only their language, but their culture, customs and cooking tips as well.Then in 2005 I moved from Rome to Montpellier, France. This time I had three years of high school French kicking around in the back of my brain somewhere, and again I knew only one person: my boyfriend of one year, Cal, an American expat who’d lived in Montpellier for five years.In theory, I would hardly consider Cal to be an exotic character; we’re both freelance writers, we both grew up in New Jersey, and we both possess the expat gene that made us move away from the comforts of home. And, my life in France is largely the same as it was in Italy – I work on my laptop, I spend my spare time with a small group of wonderful, generous friends, and I travel as much as my schedule and budget allow.Cal’s friends even took me under their wing in much the same way Marco’s did – but the personal community I’ve created here has produced a rare kind of culture shock that has turned Montpellier into a funhouse mirror version of Rome for me.That’s because not a single one of my friends is French – and Cal and I are the only full-time American expats (i.e., not nomads or students) in our circle of friends. They hail from England, Lebanon, Reunion, Australia, the Netherlands. Our common language is English; our meeting place is an English-run pub that serves burgers and jalapeno poppers; we trade books bought at an English bookshop; we keep each other informed on what movies are playing in English at the movie theater.Just as assimilation defined my time in Rome, so has isolation defined my life in Montpellier – in some ways for the better, and some for the worse.On the negative side, even after all these years I’m still not fluent in French – for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I don’t have to be when I can always turn to someone who can help me get through a conversational tough spot. Unlike in Rome, I’ve never been the only English speaker in the room. Not by a long shot. And, by insulating myself with a wall of familiarity, I haven’t gotten to know the intricacies of the culture the way I was able to in Italy, relying instead on others’ observations of a given situation.Interestingly, I have become quite well versed in British slang, culture and comfort foods. Go figure.What I’ve found to be a positive, though, is something that has actually affected me more deeply, and which I did not realize was missing from an otherwise idyllic period of my life. It’s the ability to take a breather from the culture when, sometimes, it all gets to be too much. Whether it’s a night in with Cal eating Domino’s pizza and watching old American movies or meeting my girlfriends at our favorite wine bar, I have to admit it’s relaxing after so many years of trying to blend in to embrace my outsider status, even flaunt it sometimes, and share this otherness with people who are in the same boat.Even simply being able to turn to someone and say, “Jesus, how French was that!” and have them understand and agree is uniquely satisfying. It validates the experience in a way that emails to my mom or a blog post cannot.Finally, I believe the real reason I’ve not assimilated here is that I’m fortunate enough to return to Rome several times a year for several weeks at a time. So, in a way I feel like I have retained an assimilated expat life. That may seem like a flimsy rationale to some, particularly those who dream of living in France; but for me, it’s the best of both expat worlds.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-reasons-to-take-the-train-in-france-instead-of-a-plane/,7 Reasons to take the train in France instead of a plane,France,"Gare de LyonOn our most recent trip to Europe we took the train from Paris to Geneva. Flying would also have been an option but there are some good reasons why a train ride might make a better addition to your plans:The train stations in Paris, like many European cities, are architectural treasures. They were built in the 1800s and are light airy and ornate. They were built with lofty ceilings not only so that the people waiting for a train would stay dry but, in the days of steam trains, so they would not choke on the smoke. The busiest airport in Paris is Charles de Gaulle. Charles de Gaulle airport is also Europe’s largest airport. De Gaulle was built in a very different era from its train stations. Its construction started in 1966 in an avant-garde style, but now the airport seems dated and dingy while the trains stations still seem grand.Flying is obviously quicker for the actual time that you are moving (even the TGV is slower than a plane… barely) but once you count in waiting in security lines or at baggage claim the train can be faster for some trips. This summer with the threat of being grounded by volcanic ash the train might at times be much much faster.Trains in most of Europe and certainly in France are fast and quiet. Riding them can be a comfortable experience and you never have to turn off your electronics.Seeing France from the air is cool, but riding through the French countryside on a train is also cool. Passing through the small towns makes you want to get off the train and explore… as well you should.Because airports are big and noisy they are also farther from town. As you compare the time that it takes for a journey don’t forget to factor the time to get to the airport in your equation. All the major trains stations are closer to your hotel.The cost to get to Charles de Gaule from the city center is about 8 euros on the train and more like 40 euros by taxi. It is easy to plan your journey so that your hotel is down the block from the train station which will also have a metro stop. So see Paris and then walk to the train station to get out of town.Trains pollute less and generate less green houses gases. So if you won’t take the train for yourself, do it for the planet.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/institut-du-monde-arabe-paris-france/,"Institut du Monde Arabe – Paris, France",France,"Institut du Monde Arabe (Institut of the Arab world), located in Paris’ 5th arrondissement, is at once museum, library and cultural center. A Franco-Arab project, it also hosts a Lebanese panoramic rooftop restaurant and displays a contemporary East-West design.Founded in 1980 in Paris when a group of 18 Arab countries concluded an agreement with France to inform and cooperate; the museum aids in sharing cultural exchanges and helps to form bridges between the Arab world and Europe. Libya later joined in ’84 and the building was completed in ’87.Institut de Monde Arabe begins with artifacts found across Central Asia and the Middle East in the pre-Islamic period, including many beautiful mosaics from Roman Tunisia. It then moves into pottery styles, carpet, and jewelry.The stars of the museum’s collection, however, are the illuminated manuscripts and calligraphy. Calligraphy was the central artistic endeavor of the Middle East, and the decorated Korans on display are a prime example. The collection includes the rarer Kufic script, the oldest form of Arabic writing, which dates back before 600A.D. and is the style in which the earliest known Korans were written.The museum also features medical and astronomical instruments, which serve to illustrate how much further advanced the Arab world was in the pre-Renaissance period. Succinctly said, the historical insight and artistic beauty provided by the Institut de Monde Arabe make it a worthwhile, near essential stop.Words of warning:  Photography inside the museum is not encouraged; if you are going to take photos, please be sensitive and remember that many of the artifacts are old and delicate- no flash!  As with many museums in Paris, there isn’t any information written in English… audio guide to the rescue! 5 euro.edited by Juliette Todd – Amateur Traveler EditorShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/working-on-a-castle-volunteer-travel-in-france/,Working on a Castle – Volunteer Travel in France,France,"Viewing Paris from the top of the Eiffel TowerSipping Champagne in EpernayShopping in CannesNone of these activities are what Heather Hansen was looking for when she planned her recent trip to France. She and a friend chose a volunteer vacation. Instead of the usual tourist activities, they learned medieval stone laying methods while they helped repair the grounds of an old castle in the medieval village of St. Victor La Coste.Heather says of the trip. “This was a way to experience France in a more personal and much more memorable way. ”The stay was more rustic than luxurious as they woke in the morning to the cooing of the pigeons in the coop next to their room on the 3rd story of a medieval stone house. They spent their days rebuilding a stone path and a dry stone wall under the tutelage of Pascal, a master stone setter. Pascal was very particular about getting the right stone in the right place and making sure the path was level and sloped to handle rain runoff. In the afternoons and evenings, Pascal became their tour guide. He showed them conical stone houses called bories built by shepherds, local castles, an ancient Roman aqueduct and the ubiquitous local vineyards. As they toured the town’s castle Pascal described the original structure, the modifications, and the building techniques.One evening after dinner, they played petanque (French lawn bowling) with their cook Priscilla and the other the locals in the town square until it was too dark to see the balls.On the last day, they worked next to Genoux, the owner. The more they would say “no parle Francias” the faster he talked. He explained everything in great detail in French as they tried to follow his hand motions.What made this vacation memorable? “I enjoyed living in the medieval village, eating traditional food, it was like going back in time to a simpler way of life.  Also, I enjoyed listening to the French talk about their history and how it shapes their views of current politics.  It’s a very different perspective than one gets from the media in this country. I feel connected to a piece of history that lives on in rural France.  I have great memories that will last forever.  When I came home, I built a dry stone wall along the flower bed in my front yard.  It reminds me of France.”For more information about volunteer opportunities in France see La Sabranenque.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-reasons-why-paris-is-better-than-disneyland/,7 Reasons Why Paris Is Better Than Disneyland,France,"Even in this economic downturn families will take their kids in droves to Disneyland and Walt Disney World in this coming year. I am a fan of Mickey Mouse (Amateur Traveler Episode 25 – Disneyland – why I learned to love the mouse) but I want to propose that there are reasons also to take the kids to Europe when they are still young. To make the point I want to point out 7 ways that Paris France is better than Disneyland.Shopping – Downtown Disney vs Galeries Lafayette ParisI am always surprised the amount of time some families spend shopping on their Disney trip, but if you really want incredible shopping Paris offers the well known Champs Elysees, but for my money I think that the Galeries Lafayette is an incomparable shopping experience. The building itself is like a cathedral to commercialism and the shopping is also good.Getting Around – Monorail vs MetroThe monorail is a very cool looking method of transportation. The problem is that it does not really go anywhere. The metro may be less futuristic but it is a great way to get around the city in comfort. Just look for the art deco Metro signs.FoodThis is one category where there is no competition. Even for kids the hot dog in tomorrow land is no competition for le “hot dog” which is made with a baguette, two hot dogs end to end and grilled cheese. Better yet while your kids are eating that you can be trying the escargot. (You can try the escargot but I will be having the mutton stew or whatever is the prix fixe menu).Sleeping Beauty’s Castle vs the Eiffel TowerBoth Paris and Disneyland have a center that people are drawn to and are photographed in front of. Disneyland recently reopened Sleeping Beauty’s castle to tours but frankly most people who visit the park won’t tour it. By contrast 200,000,000 people have visited the Eiffel tower. It was the tallest tower for 41 years after its construction and still captivates the imagination with its design. Saint Chapelle in ParisOriginally uploaded by CoboFotoSpectacle – Fantasmic vs Saint ChapelleDisneyland offers the loud crash of fireworks, the colorful spectacle and the magic of storytelling at Fantasmic. Families camp out on the River of America for hours to try and find a spot where they can rest they weary kids and see the show. Paris offers a quieter spectacle that still tells a story, but without all the noise, in the stain glass of its cathedrals. In my opinion the lesser known Saint Chapelle offers even more beauty than the better known Notre Dame.Thrill Ride – Roller coasters vs Driving in ParisI love Space Mountain, Indiana Jones and Big Thunder Mountain, but nothing is quite as scary as driving in Paris. The first time we drove into the city it caught us by surprise when all the lines in the road went away. How many lanes should we form? A friend from Paris said the answer is “however many you need”.Adventure – Pirates vs PickpocketsAt Disneyland you will be menaced by pirates on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride but no matter how many times you ride the ride you will still come out with all your valuables. These pirates are all talk and no plunder. Paris offers real adventure because you actually need to keep a watch on your valuables. OK… maybe there are 6 reasons why Paris is better than Disneyland.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/what-do-you-mean-europe-is-expensive/,What Do You Mean Europe Is Expensive?,France,"People go on about how expensive prices in Western Europe are.I’m sitting here in Paris sipping a decent red wine I bought for $3 a bottle. I can travel all the way across Paris20 km for $1.50. I can ride a bike from one part of the city to the other for free (Velib). My wife and daughter took the TGV here from Bordeaux, a distance of 361 miles, for $30 each.A hefty sandwich costs the same in Paris as in Boston (despite that the tax here is 20%, not 5%), but here it’s made with Ardennes ham and French Gruyere on a fresh baguette; and I’ve got a view of theSeine, not the Charles, for my picnic. More elaborate meals cost about the same here as in Boston – despite the 15% more in tax paid here.Entry to the Louvre – arguably the world’s greatest museum – costs $12. I saw the simply stupendous “Picasso and the Masters” exhibit at the Grand Palais for $16 – incredibly good. To go to the top of the Eiffel Tower costs $16, but you can get almost as good a view (and actually better for photos) on the lower levels for as little as $5. The sparkling strobe light show on the Eiffel Tower happens every hour of darkness on the hour, and costs nothing.A rental apartment can get lodging costs for a couple down to less than $100 per night… in Paris! In fact, the apartment we are renting – two bedrooms, two baths, jacuzzi, wifi, full kitchen, in the trendyMarais district only a 10-minute walk from Notre Dame – is costing us $166 per night.So what on earth are people talking about?Tom BrosnahanParis Travel PlannerShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/36-hours-granada/,"36 Hours in Granada, Spain",Grenada,"Without a doubt, Granada’s biggest attraction has to be the Alhambra palace and gardens. Built by Granada’s Nasrid rulers in the 13th and 14th centuries, the Alhambra is one of the most visited sights in Spain attracting 6,000 visitors per day.Because of the need to see what is undoubtedly the finest example of Islamic architecture in Europe, the city of Granada is often overlooked with tour operators used to shuttling visitors to the Alhambra and nothing else. Even spending only one extra day (36 hours total) in Granada will increase the value of your trip.What visitors miss is the chance to explore a compelling city where horseshoe-shaped arches and the tea houses of the old Arab quarter mix effortlessly with the tapas bars, student dives, and the flamenco clubs.Thanks in part to a large student population; Granada’s streets have an energy about them that you will not find in any other Spanish city except for Salamanca.A visit to Granada will also give you the opportunity to sample the region’s distinct food which, while on the face of it may appear to be typically Spanish has its roots in North Africa.Wander Granada’s Albaicín neighborhoodSimilar to a Middle Eastern souk or a Medina in Morocco, the Albaicín in Granada is a magical place of winding streets high above the Daro River. Full of white-washed houses, bars, restaurants, and shops selling brightly colored lanterns, the walk to the Church of San Nicolas at the top of the hill is worth it for the view alone. Even at 10:00 or 11 pm in the evening, you will meet groups of happy folk on tours and couples meandering their way up to the top to the San Nicolas square which is a most pleasant experience.A view you will never forgetSet against the dark Sierra Nevada Mountains the stunning view of the Alhambra is particularly special at sunset and the best place in Granada to capture that picture-perfect photo of the red palace.Tip – Check the time the sun is setting so that you don’t have to wait too long for your photo and then wait for the Alhambra to be lit up for another memorable photograph.Visit the birthplace of the FlamencoFirst settled by Gypsies after the conquest of the city by Christian armies in 1492 the Sacromonte district of the city is considered to be the birthplace of flamenco. When the Roma or Gitanos, as they are referred to in Spain arrived in Granada in the 15th century they lived in caves above the river. These caves today are now bars and clubs where you can witness authentic, passionate flamenco in its truest form.Tip – Don’t buy a ticket for a flamenco show from your hotel or a ticket outlet. All the flamenco bars are located on Sacromonte’s main street, so go in the evening and scope the place out for yourself. Throughout the summer, you may even catch a small flavor of flamenco out in the open as talented artists perform to passing crowds.The Alhambra in GranadaWe could not visit Granada without seeing the Alhambra and have to admit it certainly was the highlight of our weekend. Decorated in such a unique style of Islamic geometric design and lettering the Alhambra is a world wonder that should be on everyone’s bucket list.The Alhambra itself collectively includes five main parts, three of these are open all day of your visit, yet the Nasrid palaces, the real gems of your trip, are only available to be seen during the time marked on your entrance ticket. The Alhambra is a maze of real wonders to be discovered. As you encounter a different courtyard with every turn, you can almost imagine conversations that took place centuries ago on the very spot you are standing. The attractive and serene gardens enhance the magnificent palaces in every way imaginable. The ambiance created by the fountains trickling water creates a wonderful feeling of intrigue yet tranquility.Tip – Pay for the audio tour! Not only does it explain all the features of the complex, but it also tells you what life was like during the periods of its construction.Be sure and book your ticket as far in advance as possible as just turning up and hoping to get in is not an option. You can also save time by booking a skip the line tour.Where to stay in GranadaIn order to be able to explore Granada on foot stick to accommodation in the city center as all the main places of interest are either there or in the adjacent Albaicín and Sacromonte neighborhoods.Tip – You are going to do a lot of walking so make sure your shoes are comfortable and up for the job.Food & DrinkThe local beer in Granada is of course called Alhambra and comes with a tasty tapa. In most bars, it is usually a nice surprise as to what tapa you will get, but the waiters try and remember what you already had so that you don’t get the same food twice.You can, of course, pay for additional tapas or larger portions and eat cheaply while enjoying a few beers or a glass of wine. However, unlike tapas on the coast of Southern Spain, tapas in Granada can be huge.Tip – For the best tapas in town hit the bars along Calle Navas and choose a place you like the look of.Transport optionsGranada Airport (GRX) is mainly used for domestic flights but does now have regular flights on Easyjet from Gatwick and Manchester.Tip – To get to Granada from other airports in the UK you can fly to Malaga Airport on Spain’s sunny Costa del Sol. From Malaga, you can catch a bus to Granada from the airport with the Alsa bus company. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/why-you-should-see-rock-city-and-more-on-lookout-mountain-georgia/,"Rock City and more – Lookout Mountain, Georgia",Georgia,"See Rock CityAs you travel the highways of the United States, billboards advertise countless tourist attractions.  Some of these places, due to the unique way they are advertised, have even become legendary.  Over the years while traveling in the South, I’ve seen the sides of barns painted with a bold black and white sign that says “See Rock City.”  I’ve also seen this phrase on bird houses and advertising brochures, but I never actually made the effort to go see Rock City.  So when I had the opportunity to visit Chattanooga on business, I decided to schedule an extra day to visit with friends nearby and we made plans to see the famed Rock City and other sites on nearby Lookout Mountain, Georgia.Lookout MountainLookout Mountain is uniquely located where three states converge; at the southern border of Tennessee near Chattanooga, the northwest corner of Georgia, and the northeast corner of Alabama.  The 2,392-foot mountain has a rich history from the role it played in the United States Civil War.  Today, people who come to Lookout Mountain often visit the three main attractions which are Rock City, the Incline Railway and Ruby Falls.  I’ve always had a fascination with train rides and this Incline Railway has a section which is billed as the steepest grade of any railway in the world at 72.7%.  Also, after seeing so many barns and birdhouses with “See Rock City”, part of me actually wanted to find out what it was all about and after being fascinated by photographs, I wanted to see Ruby Falls as well.Our journey began in Chattanooga at The Blue Plate, where delicious, hearty pancakes gave us energy for the day ahead of us.   The drive to Lookout Mountain was well signed and fairly quick from the City Center.  It seemed logical to start with the Incline Railway which is at the bottom of Lookout Mountain.  We purchased a pass there which gave us a significant discount to the three major attractions.  You don’t have to visit all three sites in a single day but in about six hours, we were able to cover them all.Incline RailwayThe one-mile-long Incline Railway, which bills itself as “America’s Most Amazing Mile,” was built in 1895 and has undergone some major changes and modifications over the years.  The current version features a train car with ample windows and special curved seats that allow passengers to maintain comfortable seating as the steepness of the grade increases.  The views from the train were impressive and we could genuinely felt the steepness of the incline as we reached the top of the mountain.  We came to realize just how steep the incline was as we disembarked, the floor of the train had become a steep staircase that we had to climb to exit the train.At the top of the mountain, we took in the spectacular views.  Nearby is an area called Point Park that offers a scenic panorama of Chattanooga and the surrounding hills and countryside.  The Battles for Chattanooga – Electric Map and Museum has a presentation on local Civil War battles and is not too far from from the summit train station.  We opted to just enjoy the views from the railway station and eventually made our way back down the mountain on the return train trip.   You can drive to the top of Lookout Mountain and enjoy the same views, but the novelty of the train trip made it well worth the time and money.Rock City GardensRock City Gardens was our next stop and just a short drive up the mountain.  A local attraction since 1932, it is essentially a series of trails through rock formations, both at the top of the mountain as well as scenic viewpoints from mountainside cliffs.  It was named Rock City because the natural formations are aligned so they seem to form streets and lanes between the towering rocks that look like buildings. The legend of Rock City grew from an aggressive advertising campaign when the owners at the time, Frieda and Garnet Carter, offered to paint farmer’s barns if they allowed them to put a large black and white “See Rock City” sign on the side.  At the height of their campaign over 900 barns had been painted from Michigan to Texas.Each area of Rock City seems to have a story attached to it, and it is obvious that the place has grown and changed over time.  The winding trails through the rocks are genuinely fun to navigate.  How can you resist trying to make it through “Needle’s Eye” and “Fat Man’s Squeeze?”  There is even a cave filled with storybook characters called Fairyland Caverns.  The views from the top of the mountain seem to go on forever and we appreciated the relief the mountain breezes gave us from the heat of the day.Ruby FallsWe thought our last stop at Ruby Falls would be quick but found there was much more to the complex than we expected.  The falls are accessed by entering a castle-like, limestone building, taking an elevator down 26 stories deep into the mountain, then walking 2/5 of a mile on a tour with a very informative and entertaining guide.   We entered the cavern with the falls as a group and saw a presentation that featured music and colored lights.  The overall effect was impressive and at 145 feet, the falls are even more beautiful than the photographs I had seen.  This was really a full cave experience with the added attraction of the falls and even though the cavern was crowded, it didn’t take away from the beauty.ConclusionSo, at the end of the day, how did I feel about my excursion to Lookout Mountain?  Overall was it worth the time and money?It would be easy to dismiss these places because of all the hype, but I concluded that sometimes the reason places are so well advertised is because they really are unique, interesting and well worth seeing.  We all enjoyed the combination of activities much more than expected, and we marveled that we had never visited it before.   Some may complain that these places are a little overpriced, especially for a family.  Apparently, the wait to get on the Incline Railway or inside Ruby Falls can also be long, particularly on weekends.  And yes, these areas are very touristy (gift shops, souvenir photos, etc.), but each experience is unique, and in my opinion, it was well worth spending an extra day seeing the sites at Lookout Mountain.So if your travels take you in the vicinity of Lookout Mountain, definitely “See Rock City”.  While you’re at it, take a ride on the Incline Railway, and explore Ruby Falls.  You will be glad you took the opportunity and you may even take home your own little “See Rock City” birdhouse, just like I did.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-trials-and-temptations-by-cassie-bryant/,Book Review: “Trials and Temptations” by Cassie Bryant,Gambia,"I received “Trials and Temptations” by Cassie Bryant with great anticipation as Africa is a country I’ve wanted to visit.  I turned on Ladysmith Black Mambazo (correct continent but not the right country) brewed some tea and kerplunked into a comfy chair for a few hours.  What a delightful read!  I breezed through Cassie Bryant’s creatively descriptive “Trials and Temptations” memoir speckled with British terms of her experiences in the early 1980’s as a 25 year old trying something new and out of her comfort zone.   Her stories were  brief teasers of her Gambian volunteer involvement; the people she taught, the meals she enjoyed, the landscape, run ins with the native baboon named Bubber, adventures traveling throughout the country, primitive hygienic stations, naming ceremonies called ngente and her day to day challenges being “an accepted curiosity” by the community.Her hijinks and antics while volunteering with the British charity, VSO-Volunteer Services Oversees, similar to the Peace Corps, seemed to be familiar stories I’ve heard before from other volunteers with various organizations.  Reading her personalized tales, I often felt as if she was in the next chair spilling her secrets and memories while drinking Julbrew, a Gambian brewed beer.   Who would have thought that she would be water skiing with an American Foreign officer whose friend owns a Lebanese car dealership, befriend British flight attendants from the newly formed European tour travel in Africa (that had all the latest technological gadgets like a Walkman) or that her trash of deodorant cans and toilet paper tubes would be repurposed as toys for the local children?This remembrance included her personal relationships with her adult friends, local lovers and expatriates.  She shared conversations she had with her co-workers, Sisters and friends about her concerns of her successes teaching English to the women in the community.  She did not realize the extent of her achievements until she was leaving and talking with a friend. She accepted that she had helped her students reach and obtain their goals.  Furthermore, her friend comforted her by informing her that some of her students had recently been hired at the American embassy.This book was appropriately titled as it truly was a memoir consisting of trials and temptations while living abroad.  Occasionally, I felt like I was a daughter reading her mom’s journal when she was my age.  If so, I think I’d be slightly abashed.  (The feeling may be a result of the book being dedicated to her daughter.)  It was well written and concise.   There was a good balance of work, play and day to day stories.  Though her experiences were different than what I expected, they are her history that she encountered. I would recommend this book to someone who is thinking of volunteering, trying to find their spot in the world or for someone who is looking to be transported to a different locale for a few hours.  Disclaimer:  A free copy of this book was given to the reviewer with an expectation that a fair and honest review would be written of it.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/archaeological-sites-museums-greece-top-six-choices-take-children/,Best Archaeological Sites and Museums For Kids In Greece,Greece,"The culture and history of Greece sometimes gets overshadowed by beach holidays and often there are wasted opportunities for visiting the numerous museums and archaeological sites.For families with children of school age such visits are even more important. What could be more exciting yet educational at the same time than letting the children explore some of the historical monuments in Greece? Their eyes will open in awe when they see the statues, mythological heroes, frescoes and ancient sites in real life — things they had only seen in books or on television.Kids Love Greece has selected the top six archaeological sites and museums that should not be missed on any family visit to Greece.  All you need is your camera to capture those once in a life time moments and impress your friends back home, not to mention the teacher of course.ACROPOLIS – AthensStarting in Athens, a visit the Acropolis is an absolute ‘must’.  Located at the highest point of the city you will be in awe of the magnificent temples dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena.  The children will see the climb up to the top as an adventure, and you will admire the stunning views. Close your eyes for a moment and try to reflect back to the Golden Age of Pericles. If you would like to continue the fun, hop on a tourist train which can take you to various places in the wider area e.g. the Roman market and Supreme Court.Tip for the family photo: pose in front of the Parthenon and say ‘CHEESE’. Surely this snapshot will deserve a worthy place on the mantelpiece in your living room?ACROPOLIS MUSEUM – AthensThe Acropolis Museum is your next appointment with history as it houses all the famous exhibits of the Acropolis. The innovative architecture will grab your attention as it gives the impression of climbing up a rocky hill as you go up the different levels, and the transparent floors makes it feel like you are in the air above the archaeological sites. Children’s activities have been carefully selected, all linked to various exhibitions such as the ‘Archaic Colors’ and ‘Looking for goddess Athena’. You can combine the Acropolis visit with renting a family Bike from the FunBike store across the road from the Acropolis Museum (can fit up to 8 people).Tip for the family photo: say ‘CHEESE’ under the Caryatids columns which prominently dominate inside the museum.NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM- Athens The National Archaeological Museum is the biggest museum in the country, with a huge range of sculptures, pots, weapons and jewels covering all periods of antiquity. The neoclassical museum building is impressive in itself. Make sure you get a map of the museum and select the specific collections you wish to see, depending on the age and the interests of your children. If your children are of a younger age, we believe the exhibits that will be more interesting for them are the Cycladic figurines and the sculpture collection. For older children we suggest the Egyptian collection and also the antiquities from Thira (Santorini) island, located on the top floor of the museum.Tip for the family photo: say “Cheese” next to the huge and impressive statue of Kouros which is 3 meters in height.THE ORACLE OF DELPHI This archaeological site at Delphi, the most famous oracle of the ancient Greek world, is definitely worth the 2 hour drive from Athens. Open any Greek mythology book and read about Pythia who was credited for her prophecies which were inspired by Apollo. Delphi was considered to be the ‘centre of the world’ in ancient times and it takes only a quick stroll around the ruins to understand why. Delphi is the place where history and mythology fuse together and proof that what was once a glorious mythical place is very real.We recommend that you visit the museum before walking around the ruins as it explains very well everything you are about to see.Tip for the family photo: say ‘CHEESE’ as you stand beside the large bronze statue of the Charioteer of DelphiPALACE OF KNOSSOS – Heraklion, CreteOne of the most significant parts of Greek mythology and also European history unfolds in Crete, the largest island of Greece.  The Palace of Knossos with its 4000 years of history lies just to the south of Heraklion, the island’s capital city. This was the cradle of the first European civilization, the Minoans. Knossos is also associated with great legends such as Theseus and the Minotaur, and Daedalus and Icarus.Marvel at the colorful frescoes as you travel back in time.  The throne room of the great King Minos will impress the boys, while the Boudoir of Queen Pasiphae will go down well with the girls.Tip for the family photo: say ‘CHEESE’ as you stand in front of the fresco ‘Prince of the Lilies’ or ‘The Blue Ladies’.ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM – Heraklion, CreteThe Heraklion Archaeological Museum is located in the centre of Heraklion and should be seen as an integral part of your visit to the Palace of Knossos. It has recently been renovated and its new wing adds an extra sparkle to the museum. All the captions are stylish and the explanatory texts will help you understand the glory of all the exhibits. One of the exhibits, the Phaistos disc, will probably be your children’s favorite showpiece as it has an air of mystery to it. As of today no one has managed to decipher its meaning. Indeed, the National Geographic rightly included it in the X-files of ancient times.Tip for the family photo: say ‘CHEESE’ next to Phaistos Disc. Put your archaeologist-explorer hat on and try to solve the mystery.Do you need more inspiration about what to do and where to go in Greece?

https://amateurtraveler.com/halkidiki-a-holy-land-in-north-greece/,Visiting Mount Athos and other Religious Sites in Northern Greece (Halkidiki),Greece,"Halkidiki (or Chalkidiki) is located in northern Greece 69 km from the city of Thessaloniki. It essentially consists of three ‘fingers’ jagging into the Aegean Sea. These three prongs are Kassandra, Sithonia, and Mount Athos. The inviting beaches of Halkidiki and the established facilities here have made it one of the tourism hotspots in Greece. There is also plenty of opportunity for religious tourism thanks to the numerous old churches here. Besides, Mount Athos abounds with monasteries and is exclusively reserved for spiritual advancement. Read on to learn more about religious tourism in Halkidiki, Greece.Halkidiki – GreeceMythology and History of HalkidikiThis region has a rich and colorful mythology. In fact, Kassandra, Sithonia and Mount Athos are all named after characters in Greek mythology. There is evidence that humans inhabited this part of Greece as early as 700,000 years ago. The oldest known inhabitants were Thracians who lived here in the fourth century BC. Modern history begins in 1430 when the Turks invaded this area. They ruled the area for four centuries until the Greek revolution began in 1821. Greek fighters finally evicted the Turks in 1922 and restored Halkidiki to Greece.The demographics of Halkidiki changed in 1921 when refugees from Bulgaria, Eastern Thrace, and Asia Minor flooded the area as they were driven homeless by the Asia Minor catastrophe of the Greco-Turkish War. These newcomers enriched the place with their unique cuisine, music, and culture. You can still find the people of Halkidiki proudly holding on to and practicing their ancient traditions.Religious Tourism in HalkidikiReligious tourists have plenty to do and see in Halkidiki. Besides the ancient churches, they can make a pilgrimage to the monastic island of Mount Athos. Every year, about a million tourists travel to his cradle of orthodox Greek Christianity. The monasteries here abound with ancient relics and utensils, priceless artwork, mosaics, libraries, and rich murals. There is also the Ioustinianos museum which is located in the village of Flogita and is devoted to Byzantine art.Churches in HalkidikiThe following are a few of the popular and important churches in Halkidiki:The Monastery of ZographouThe Monastery of ZographouThis ancient monastery in Kassandra is dedicated to Saint George, known as Saint George the Zograf, and was a dependency of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church because it was founded by three Bulgarian Monks, Moses, Aaron, and Ioannis from Achri in the late 9th or early 10th century. Today it attracts many visitors who are awed by the remains including the main church, a 14th century Byzantine tower and a fountain constructed in 1853.Athonite Monastery of DochiariouAthonite Monastery of DochiariouThe Athonite Monastery of Dochiariou was founded in the 10th century by the Monk Daniel the Docheiarios and is part of Mount Athos. The church inside the monastery was built in 1568 and is devoted to Archangels Michael and Gabriel and is the biggest church in Mount Athos. Inside the temple, you will find murals by the famous Cretan painter Tzotzis. Please have in mind that you have to apply for a permit in order to visit Mount Athos and the monastery and as in every monastery in Mount Athos only men are allowed to enter.The Church of Agios DemetriusThe Church of Agios DemetriusThis is my favorite church in Halkidiki! The hallmark of this holy place is its unique architecture constructed like a basilica. It has an awe-inspiring dome and houses old religious reliefs and icons. It is located in Aphytos village and was built in 1858. Aphytos is a small village 4 km outside of Kalithea. If you ever plan to visit Greece and Halkidiki you have to visit this village too.The Chapel of Panaghia PhaneromeniThe Chapel of Panaghia PhaneromeniA beautiful chapel with bright white walls, this church is located at the beach shore on the path to Nea Skioni. You can find amazing frescoes here dating back to the 16th century. According to the local tradition the church was built at the beach shore by the villagers because they have found a big marble with the depiction of the Virgin Mary floating on the surface of the sea. Although the initial plan was to build the church on the hill, every night the church would be destroyed and the marble icon was found near the sea.Monastic Mount AthosMonastic Mount AthosThe monastic self-governed state of Mount Athos is also called the Holy Mountain. This peninsula has been declared a world heritage site by UNESCO. It hosts many monasteries on its green rugged slopes, which are home to about 2,000 monks. Women are not allowed to enter Mount Athos, and men must apply for a permit, months beforehand to visit here. Even with a permit, men can only stay up to four days. Women and men without a permit can get onto excursion boats that sail around Mount Athos to view the monasteries and other sights from a distance. There is a hotel in this area that took its name from Mount Athos and throughout the year organizes special events with the Friends of Mount Athos such as conferences, lectures, and exhibitions in order to promote religious and charitable work. Tourists and especially Orthodox Russians and Orthodox Bulgarians prefer this hotel exactly for this reason.If you are a fun of religious tourism and Greece you can check some other posts from Chris here and here.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-crete/,Things to do in Crete – Greece,Greece,"Greece has been in the news quite a lot over the last couple of years but the news has not been very good. Strikes and protests in Athens around the economic crises have scared away some travelers. Consider instead a trip to the largest of the Greek Islands, the island of Crete.  Crete is definitely worth seeing and Crete holidays will take you far away from the turmoil you might find in Athens.Things to do in HeraklionHeraklion is a good starting point for Crete as you can reach it by high-speed ferry from Athen’s port of Pireas or from the popular island of Santorini or by air. You can easily see some of the complex history of Crete in the architecture of Heraklion. A Venetian fortress (Rocca al Mare) still guards its harbor, but the city was first founded by Saracens (Muslims) who took the island from the Eastern Roman Empire. So you find buildings like the Ottoman Vezir Mosque which was built on the site of the original St Titus church and later turned back into the St Titus basilica.Crete’s history is even older than the rest of Greece. The oldest civilization in all of Europe was the Minoan civilization on Crete.  Crete was the power in the eastern Mediterranean from the 27th century to the 15th century BC. It predates the Greece of Socrates (4th century BC) or even the Greece of the Trojan War (13th or 12th century BC). The best place to see some of the ruins of the Minoans is at Knossos outside of the city of Heraklion.KnossosIn mythology, King Minos ruled from a palace at Knossos where he kept the Minotaur (half man and half bull) inside a labyrinth until it was slain by Theseus. There was a palace or at least a center of Minoan politics and culture at Knossos, but there is no evidence of a minotaur or a labyrinth. What you will find is extensive ruins and some admittedly ham-fisted attempts by archeologist Arthur Evans to recreate some of the artwork, often from little original evidence. Definitely take a tour as the tour guides can help separate what is Minoan and what came from Evan’s imagination.Things to do in RethymnoFurther west from Heraklion is the beautiful beach town of Rethymno. Getting to Rethymno from Heraklion is a fairly simple drive along the national highway… or at least it would be relatively simple if so many Cretan drivers were not present. Driving on Crete (http://europe.amateurtraveler.com/2008/07/14/driving-on-crete/) has its challenges as the 2 lane highway is driven as if it had 3-4 lanes. So if you are in the slow “lane” you are really halfway onto the shoulder of the road.The North shore of Crete has beaches that are better than most of the better-known beaches in Europe. Forget the rocky beaches of the French Riviera or Southern Spain, Rethymno has a sandy beach and a wonderful old town with lots of shops, restaurants, and bars. Some of the more interesting bars can be found on the border between the beach and the old city and have all outdoor seating and look more like living rooms than bars.Above the old town is the massive Fortezza on Paleokastro (“Old Castle”) hill. The fortress was built by the Venetians (well by 107,142 Cretans conscripted by the Venetians) in the 1500s after the Turks had burned Rethymno to the ground. It was conquered by the Turks a century later. A tour of the fortress is worth the hour it will take you away from the beach.The harbor in the old town is quieter during the day but then gets more energy as the sun goes down. Each restaurant has a barker (or in Greek a “kamaki” or a harpoon) that beckons you to their particularly wonderful food. Seafood is very popular but brick oven pizzas or traditional Greek fare like souvlaki or mousaka are also plentiful.Things to do in ChaniaStill further west on the North shore is the city of Chania which is the other natural place to enter or leave Crete as it also has an airport and fast ferry service. The colorful Central Market is a great starting point for exploring the old town of Chania. Seafood, cheese, olives, olive oil, and other Greek products will provide great photographs and a pretty great picnic.Chania also has a harbor lined with small restaurants, as well as horse-drawn carriage rides, glass-bottom boats, and an old lighthouse.Outside of Chania there is a British cemetery dedicated to the 1,742 soldiers who were killed in the battle for Crete in World War 2. In May 1941 the skies suddenly filled with German planes as part of the first primarily airborne invasion in history. The success of the Germans on Crete led to the Allies training their own paratroopers.These days Crete spends less time warding off Saracen pirates or raiding Turks and more time entertaining tourists. The complex mixture of cultures has created a colorful, beautiful and delicious island that deserves a place on your to-do list.You can hear more about Crete in Travel to England and Greece Revisited – Episode 138This post was originally published on the GAdventures Blog – Places to Visit in CreteShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/santorini-greece-awaits/,The Best Places in Santorini Greece,Greece,"Visiting Greece is like being welcomed into the family. The people are warm and friendly, and the country is absolutely gorgeous. Nowhere did my family experience this more than on the breathtakingly beautiful island of Santorini.Santorini was easily my favorite of the islands that we visited. It is incredibly picturesque, with buildings of crisp white and saturated blue perched atop steep cliffs, a thousand feet above the bright aqua Aegean. It’s no wonder that the island has served as a backdrop for many movies, including Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Summer Lovers, and my personal favorites, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 1 & 2.When you arrive on Santorini by ferry, countless taxis and buses await, eager to deliver you to your destination. The taxi ride up the side of the cliff was one of the more nerve-wracking experiences I’ve had. Taxis, cars, trucks, and buses casually pass each other on narrow roads and seem to nearly collide at every switchback. Our taxi driver, clearly a seasoned professional, made the trip without batting an eyelash.AkrotiriFor a tourist with only a few days to see the sights, Santorini is definitely manageable. It is quite small, only about 12 miles long and at most 3 miles wide. Our 3-day trip began near the town of Akrotiri at a lovely, family-run hotel called Villa Mathios, where Mamma still does all of the cooking. Our host, the gregarious Costas Popalexis, welcomed us with open arms. Whenever we saw him during our stay, he would call out, “Family!”Since we visited Greece in May, during the off-season, there were only a few other customers. At the hotel restaurant that evening, we enjoyed delicious food and chatted with our host over a complimentary glass of ouzo (which tastes like licorice and is definitely not my cup of tea). Costas told us that during the high season, the hotel restaurant is packed and you would need a reservation. He also taught us a very important word in Greek: “Yiamas,” which means “Cheers.” So, the next time someone offers you ouzo, you can say “Yiamas! But really, no thanks.”There is an archeological site in Akrotiri which we would have visited but it was closed when we were there as there had just been an accident. The site is Minoan which is the oldest civilization in Europe.While Costas is definitely the most memorable example, all of the locals we encountered were friendly, hospitable and relaxed. We were told that 90% of the Greek economy is based on tourism, so it’s no wonder they are so happy to see us tourists! Of course, the sunny weather and beautiful scenery couldn’t hurt.FiraOn our first full day in Santorini, we rented a car and drove to the town of Fira. Fira is a great place to wander, shop and take in one of Santorini’s many spectacular views. We saw hoards of cruise ship passengers in Fira, who then got onto the cable car near the cathedral to return to port, having seen nothing of Santorini but the shops of Fira.PerivolosAfter a gyro and some ice cream, we drove to the beach at Perivolos. On the outer rim of the island, you can drive straight to the beach without hiking down the cliffs. As we had heard, the beaches on Santorini are fairly gravelly. Perivolos is a grey sand beach, but Santorini also has red and grey sand beaches. We enjoyed our time at Perivolos, swimming, building sandcastles and sunbathing in chaises that happened to be free that day in celebration of a restaurant’s grand opening.At our hotel, we learned that water is in short supply on Santorini, as all of the water is gathered in the winter months, then stored for use during the rest of the year. Electricity is also a concern, so to save electricity, our room key had to be inserted into a panel by the door to turn on the electricity.OiaThe next day, we drove to Oia on the Northern tip of the Caldera to have dinner and watch the sunset. On the way, we stopped in Pyrgos, a beautiful little village not yet overrun by tourists. We intended to visit the ruins of the ancient city of Thira, but it was closed by the time we got there. From Thira to Oia, the road is steep and winding. In Oia, we found a table with a great view at the Sunset Restaurant and watched a lovely sunset over the water. We only had to throw a few elbows to get the other tourists out of our sightline (Jokes. No tourists were harmed in the viewing of this sunset).VolcanoThe crescent-shaped island surrounds a caldera formed 3600 years ago by an enormous volcanic eruption. During our trip, we visited the two volcano islands in the caldera. On the first, we hiked to the top with a guided tour, which was interesting and provided a good overview of Santorini’s volcanic history. The volcano is active and last erupted in 1950. Our boat then continued on to the second island, where we swam into the hot springs but opted not to take a mud bath in the iron-rich mud.If it was not clear above, one of the things we enjoyed about Greece, in general, was the food. Santorini was no exception. There are many great restaurants on Santorini, but I do particularly recommend getting away from the main drag in Fira which is inundated with cruise ship travelers to some of the quieter niches like Akrotiri for a more Greek experience.In our three days on Santorini, we saw the sights, relaxed and soaked in the beauty of this island paradise. I have visited over 15 countries and Santorini is definitely the first place that I would return to. The beautiful views and the limitless hospitality of the Greek people make Santorini a place where any tourist could feel at home. I hope this article encourages you to book Santorini holidays.PodcastHear more about our trip by listening to Travel to England and Greece Revisited – Amateur Traveler Episode 138Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/travel-journal-greece-crete/,Travel Journal – Greece (Crete),Greece,"Santorini to Heraklion, Crete – May 29We were taking the fast catamaran to Crete. I was amazed how many people the ferry holds. I would guess around the same as 2-3 wide body jets. Joan and beth sat together and I ended up with a woman and two young ladies from Dallas. The woman, Helen, is a Greek American who now owns and runs a bed and breakfast in Chania. She also runs private tours for small numbers of people (think 2 or 3) all over Greece. She was traveling with her niece and a friend. We had a great chat and she invited us to look her up in Chania when we are there and she would show us the town. I was surprised that she only gives tours for Americans. She has found Americans to be easy to please which surprised me.We had not been given good reports of Heraklion by a number of people, but after we checked into our hotel we wandered out to get some dinner. Much of the old town is a pedestrian area. The center square was particularly hopping with night life. There was a good band playing and lots of young people out in particular. I wish I could say as much for the band’s lead singer but she was painful to listen to. The city still has old walls and an old port dating from when Venice ruled here. I would say our impression of Heraklion was more positive than I expected.When we got back to the hotel we watched some TV. We notice that Greek TV seems to have fewer commercial breaks but they seem to be much longer.Heraklion to Rethymno – May 30We got up earlier so that we would be ready to go when they dropped off our rental car at 8:30 AM as it seemed unlikely that they would find a space to park. So we had our breakfast at the hotel and were packed and in the lobby. The driver from Caravel did find a space in a semi-legal parking space and we did all the paperwork and then tried to load 3 suitcases in a very small car. We ended up with one in the backseat. Joan and Liz went and got a Starbucks fix (4 euros) from a Starbucks we had walked by the night before. We drove out of town to a gas station and to the ancient ruin of Knosos without incident.As we got near to Knosos there were a number of men beckoning us into their free parking lot by their shop or tavern, but we kept on driving to the official (and also free) parking at the site.The entrance fee was 12 euros for us and free for Liz since she is 18 or under. We opted to do a tour for an additional 20 euros (10 per adult). The tour guide was soliciting people for an English tour and we had to wait for her to get 10 adults. We were glad we had done the tour as it was the difference between “look there is a wall” and knowing that 4 different cities were built on this site. The Minoan is the oldest civilization in Europe. Twice this palace was destroyed in earthquakes caused by eruptions on near by Santorini. After the last time the Mycenaeans came in and took over Crete, driving the Minoans into the hills. Much of what is seen in Knosos is reconstruction by the English archeologist Arthur Evans and often is more a tribute to his imagination than to what we really know of the Minoans. Apparently a lot of people come looking for the legendary labyrinth of Knosos, but no such thing exists… sadly. This was the palace of the “double ax” used in Minoan ceremonies, the word for double ax came is the root of labyrinth.We had some lunch across the street at one of the local cafes. Those cafes are more expensive but we were hungry. I picked up a hat since I have been getting sunburned on my face. Liz, my daughter, says it does complete my tourist look.We drove around and around trying to get out of town to find the National highway. We would have been better suited to have driven all the way back to the harbor rather than follow the signs that directed us into alleys and then disappeared. We ended up getting out of town as much by dead reckoning and just following random cars as anything else (using the Dirk Gently, a Douglas Adam’s character’s, method).There were a lot of hills on the beautiful highway from Heraklion to Rethymno. The little rental car we had did not pass many cars on the way but was passed by quite a few. The Crete style of driving means that cars will drive on teh shoulder to let people pass and that people will pass almost anywhere.We found our hotel in Rethymno fairly easily although the parking on the street confused us as it was obvious that you needed some sort of ticket but it was not clear where to get one. The hotel desk clerk told us to get one from a local news stand. You buy one ticket per hour and then punch out the chads for the correct day, hour and minute. We laid an array of the cards on the dash of the car.We wandered into the old town which is a wonderful place. It has numerous shops that the ladies enjoyed and picture taking opportunities everywhere for me. We wandered through the streets and alleys and down to the seaside. The city feels both a beach town as well as a historic town. A Venetian fortress looks down on the old town which we will see tomorrow.We met Goran from Serbia who was one of the people who stand in front of the many restaurants and tries to bring people in (Kamaki – the one who speaks). We talked to him for a while about Crete. He and his wife, who is from the Netherlands, met in Crete. They lived in Netherlands, but that did not work for him, and Serbia, but that did not work for her, and have moved back to Crete.We found a restaurant with brick oven pizza. Most of the restaurants have sea food and Greek dishes. As much as we like Greek food we do wonder, coming from a region with a great variety of food, why more people don’t differentiate their restaurant by opening a restaurant with a different menu. Some of the restaurants and bars along the sea side part of the old town have more of the look of a living room (including one called the Living Room) than a restaurant.I checked the internet for email in the lobby of the hotel after we returned and downloaded more podcasts since I have run out.Rethymno – May 31We got up and had a very nice breakfast at the hotel. We checked the internet again to see what life is life in the real world.We probably would not have stayed in Rethymno for an entire additional day if we did not have a hotel room for another night. As much as we love Rethymno, we have seen much of it already. We had yet to see the fortress and the beach so it promised to be a relaxed day.We walked to the fortress first. It is quite a large fortress but there were no interpretive brochures or signs so if you have not seen something like this you might not know what you are looking at. It reminded me of El Morro in Puerto Rico so I am guessing it is late 1500s in construction until I learn otherwise. The walls are angled in a way that would indicate it was of post gunpowder construction. There was one bastion that had been turned into a theatre and the ladies hung out there while I looked around in more detail.We stopped for a crepe break from Crepa Land as they were just opening and then walked over to the beach to the right of the marina which looked great. You can rent an umbrella and two chaises for 9 euros. We returned to the hotel for a nap for Liz, a brief one for me and some time with Joan wrestling with the hotel computer to try and print something from an email.We changed into our suits and returned to the beach. Along the way we bought a beach towel since we had not brought any (4 euros). Somehow when Joan went into the first store to by a towel she came out with Nutella. What we have here is a failure to communicate.The beach was very nice. It might be my favorite beach in Europe that I have seen. It is a nice sandy beach with warm water. It has very little in the way of waves so it is more of a swimming beach as body surfing would not work. It is a shallow beach so we saw a number of kids. I would guess about one in ten women were topless without regard to age or body type. We had run into our friend Goran again who suggested going further down from the marina where it would be better. We ended up getting 3 chaises and an umbrella for 7 euros. I am guessing that we may have paid less because it was later in the day.After the beach we cleaned up, checked the Internet again and then returned to the old town for a traditional Greek dinner at one of the restaurants we had seen grilling over a wood fire.I moved the car from where I had parked it blocks away in a free area to next to the hotel as parking is not enforced on Sundays. I looked some more for s hotel for our last night in London before going to bed.Rethymno to Chania – June 1We had breakfast at the hotel again, checked email, finished booking a hotel for London and then called Helen Swanston who I had met on the ferry to Heraklion. She and her family were planning an outing into the mountains to eat at a great Greek restaurant at one of the highest villages. She invited us along and gave us directions to get to her place outside Chania (well to get close to her house as the directions ended with “you are close, pull over and call from there”).We drove to Chania without incident which is always a relief given the style of driving on Crete where cars will pass you anywhere and you had to drive as far right in the lane as you can both to let people pass and as a survival mechanism against people passing coming the other way. I did not get through on my U.S. iPhone but called Helen from my new UK cell phone and she came and got us. Her bed and breakfast is lovely with great view of the water from the hills on the Akrotiri peninsula. If we did not already have pre-paid reservations we would have gladly stayed there.Helen drove Joan, Liz and I in one car and her friend Joy followed with Helen’s mother, niece Sarah, and Sarah’s friend Elena. We wound up and up into the white mountains south of Chania. I could have driven the road but was glad to not have to attempt it in a little standard rental car. I was also glad to be able to look at the beautiful scenery. We drove passed orchards of orange trees (most of them are exported to germany) and olives. The hills were also decorated with the pink flowers from Oleander bushes that grow wild. At the highest point of the road in the little town of Zorva. In Zorva we stopped at the Taverna Amelia where Helen had made reservations.The restaurant is surprisingly large considering that (at least until some new construction finishes) there are maybe 5 houses in Zorva. The restaurant can hold many more as it is popular with the locals for celebrations like baptisms and naming days. We heard stories of baptism parties with 100 people or weddings with 1000 guests. We had a number of appetizers like a sort of zucchini and potatoes au gratin, bread, a greek salad, a cooked butter (more like cheese). The main dinner was boiled lamb and a rice that is traditionally served at weddings. The name of the rice caused some amusement because it translates into English with a name which I will describe as copulating rice. The term Helen used was of more Anglo-Saxon origin and earned her a slap from her friend Joy. We ate from two thirty to five o’clock in a very leisurely European manor.We drove down the hills through one of the ravines, past more memorials to people who had missed the turns on the windy road with more goats than guard rails.Helen then also took us to the British war memorial to those who died in the Battle of Crete in 1941 before guiding us back into town directly to our hotel. What a wonderful gift to have such hospitality. There are benefits to talking to your seat mates.Our hotel in Chania (Hotel Akati) was at 1866 square which is very conveniently located just south of the old town. I was given instructions to drive the wrong way down a one way street to get to the back of the building and down the steep driveway into their parking garage. The staff was very friendly and the room was nice, although we did note with some apprehension that they were doing construction next door.We walked into the old town and down to the old Venetian harbor. Many of the shops were closed on a Sunday night. We decided to forgo dinner and picked up some Greek cheese dip (we have to find a recipe for this!) and crackers to go with the fresh apricots that Helen had sent with us.Chania – June 2We had breakfast at the hotel, checked our email and then went out to explore Chania. This was our last real day of vacation but we are getting ready to go home. We strolled and shopped our way at a leisurely pace. Rethymno may be somewhat more photogenic… or maybe it is just time to go home.After a light lunch and a rest at the hotel we headed to the beach late in the afternoon. We went to the beach to the West of the old town. It seemed that most of the people at the beach were locals. It was a smaller beach than at Rethymno but also a beautiful sandy, shallow beach. The water was either a little warmer or a little colder depending on which of us you ask. We rented 3 chaises and an umbrella for 7.5 euros and stayed until afternoon changed to evening. A number of men at a restaurant across the street serenaded us with what we assume to be Greek folk songs.We had a typical Greek dinner in the old town. It seems like you can pick a restaurant completely at random and get a good meal. A Gyro or Souvlaki, a Greek salad and wine cost us around 12 euros. We only needed two of these to feed the 3 of us.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/trip-journal-greece-santorini/,Trip Journal Greece (Santorini),Greece,"Athens to Santorini – May 25We packed up and took the subway to the port of Piraeus again where we boarded out high speed ferry for Santorini. We stopped at a coffee chain called Geoffrey’s (we only figured out the name later as the sign was in a very stylized greek) for some pastries to eat on the boat. We assumed (correctly) that food on board would be expensive. As we waited to board we watched some Chinese tourists enlist others in making strange tai-chi-like poses for pictures.When you board the ferry everyone stops by a baggage room and stores their larger suitcases on the car deck. You won’t have access to this deck during the voyage. We found our seats in a sparsely populated VIP area. So this is how the other half lives. The seats are similar in style to airlines seats with the economy seats being a bit more weathered. We had a table with a power outlet so I was able to catch up on my journal, some email, some podcasts, and some reading I brought on my laptop. We spent some time outside looking at the view but they don’t want you close to the edge of the ship while the ship is moving. This being a high speed ferry it moves at a pretty good pace and we were soon threading through the islands of the Cylides.There was a TV on that was broadcasting various shows like Extreme Home Makeover and car racing.As you approach Santorini your first impression is that the island is snow covered until your eye resolves that it is the white houses at the top of the cliffs. It is as we expected a beautiful and striking island as you sail into the caldera of a dormant (we hope) volcano. Everyone is encouraged to grab their bags and gather on the car deck before the ship docks so that it can upload quickly. As the ship unloads there is a confused scene of taxies, people with rooms to rent, rental cars and buses awaiting a relatively small ship load of tourists. I would guess there were 70-100 of us getting off. We found a taxi that would take us to our hotel in Akrotiri which is at one end of the crescent shaped island. The ride was about 10-15 minutes and 15 euros. We shared a taxi with a U.C. Berkeley student from Sacramento who had just finished a semester abroad in Barcelona. She had been on the island for 2 days and had just seen some friends off at the ferry.We are staying at the Villa Mathios just outside of Akrotiri which is right up the cliff from the black sand beach but on the other (non-caldera) side of the road. Our host is Costas Popalexis In addition to this family run hotel (momma does the cooking he explained) he runs a travel agent business so we will take advantage of that to book a rental car and at least one excursion here as well as finalize our plans for Crete. We had booked a triple but Costas had upgraded us for free to a Jr suite where the master bed is in a loft. The room cost $100 a night, but $150 after taxes and fees on hotels.com. It is a lovely spot. There are certainly fancier resorts on Santorini with infinity pools overlooking the crater but this has 51 rooms, and two pools with a restaurant in between them. It is clean, attractive and a huge step up from our last hotel. We have heard about Greek hospitality and this is it. As Costas talked about helping us book excursions he said there are a number of more expensive ones but his goal is that we have a great time and still have enough money that we can come back next year.We rested before dinner and then while Liz stayed in the room and read Joan and I walked down to the black sand beach. It is not marked on the road and was almost deserted. Much of the beach is pebbles (as we are told with much of the beaches on the island) but there was a small part with sand. We sat on the beach and watched the sun set over an array of small fishing boats before we trekked back up the hill to dinner.Dinner was wonderful. We had local beef, greek salad, cheese dip (feta and yogurt), cheese filled meatballs. The vegetables were from the garden and the beef was locally raised. Overall it was probably our best meal so far on the trip. With a glass of local wine and a complementary glass of uzo from our host we lingered in the restaurant. Costas and his adorable young daughter sat with a few other locals when he was done working the tables. I think 4 tables were in use inside and a couple more on the patio. During high season he said the hotel is packed and you need reservations for dinner. He enjoys this time of year when there is actually time to talk to the guests.Santorini – May 26We were in no rush getting up and getting going. We started by sitting down with Costas and making our plans for Crete, booking a sailing excursion and renting a small car here on Santorini. The rental car company came and dropped off the car shortly thereafter (around 11 AM). The young Greek man who brought the car was bantering loudly with Costas in Greek and apologized that Greeks are loud. It is kind of a nice change to be in a country where Americans are not considered loud. Costas in particular has an affection for Californians who he thinks are more relaxed than other Americans. This might also reflect on getting good press in two of the San Francisco newspapers.I brushed up on my ability to drive stick in a small car by Kia (I used to drive a Ford Aspire made by Kia). We drove first to the gas station since the car was delivered empty and should be returned that way. Gas was around 1.30 euros per liter (more than the $4 we complain about). We then drove into Thira and parked at the free municipal lot. There seems to be some inconsistency on whether the name of the town is Thira or Fira but in greek they spell it with a theta so I have adopted the “th” spelling in English.We then spent hours walking around Thira while the ladies shopped and I shot pictures and video. I also just took some time to sit and look at the amazing view. Joan and Liz both bought some jewelry and Liz also bought some clothes in the many shops.I found it interesting that al the video I have seen focuses on the views from the towns like Thira so I had a very skewed impression of the island. It is larger than I thought. It takes about 45 minutes to drive from one end of the crescent shaped island to the other. Away from the caldera the island is mostly fields. There are many grapes (grown on the ground instead of in arbors) and a few wineries. The high point (in elevation) on the island is capped with a monastery.There was a cruise ship anchored in the bay and we watched a number of tour groups come en mass to the area around the cathedral. They were then pointed towards the cable car that ges back down to the port. So that is the part of the island you will see in most cases when you see Santorini from a cruise, basically just the shops of Thira.After a Gyro for lunch and an ice cream break we drove back to the Akrotiri end of the island in the later afternoon to the beach at Perivolos. On this outer rim of the island you can drive straight to the beach without a hike. Perivolos is a black sand/gravel beach with a number of private chaises and umbrellas. We sat at a pair of the chaises and I went to find the cost. I asked the young man if he spoke English and he said (in Greek) just a little. I told him I spoke a little Greek (in Greek), but we did manage to communicate (mostly in English) that today we could sit for free as his restaurant had just opened yesterday and was celebrating. He did say that the area was just for his customers so we ordered a could of ice teas. He came back in a little while and said he did not have ice tea left. He could offer us coffee or champagne. When I asked the price he said that it was all free today. So let me get this straight… I can sit at your umbrella but only if I drink your free champagne. I can do that.After a swim in the sea, a sand castle and some sunning (napping for me) we headed back to the hotel for a quick swim in one of the pools. We ate at the hotel again. We ordered a small assorted meat tray, a stuffed zucchini special (which made us wonder why we have not used the recipe we have) and the cheese dip. That proved to be to much food for the 3 of us. They brought us a pie crust like pastry for dessert. I don’t know what it was but I loved it.We watched one of the movies I brought on the laptop (The Freedom Writers) and went to bed.Santorini – May 27The supply of clean clothes we brought or clothes we washed out on the way is dwindling but the hotel has asked that we not wash out clothes in the room. Santorini gathers all the water it needs during the Winter months and stores it for use during the year so water is in short supply. The water in the room has a salty taste so we have been buying bottled water to drink from the market next door. Costas advises that laundry will be cheaper if we can make it to Crete because water is not in short supply there. Electricity is also a bit erratic. To save electricity the room key has to be inserted in a slot to turn on electricity when you are in the room.We got in the car and decided to first drive to the lighthouse past Akrotiri but we missed the turn off (almost directly across from our hotel) so we ended up driving towards the closed Akrotiri ruins instead. We parked in the parking lot for the well known red beach and hiked until we could see that beach. It was too early for us to do the beach so we backtracked to the road to the lighthouse and drove out to it. It sits on on end of the island. It has a nice view, but where on Santorini doesn’t. We got more entertainment from a group of 8 French tourists on four ATVs trying to maneuver all eight vehicles without hitting one another as they tried to park the unfamiliar machines in a narrow space. A number of people rent ATVs or scooters on Santorini. The ATVs are small enough that one of the women just picked up the back end and pivoted it around to park it.We headed slowly to the other part of the island and Ia. Our goal was to be at Ia for dinner and the sunset but since the whole drive would only take 45 minutes we were in no hurry. we stopped at a few art studios and ended up buying a print of a watercolor of Santorini. We also stopped at the Gavala winery and sampled 5 of their locally grown wines. The family run winery has been in business for 4 generations. We enjoyed the whites we tried (the one red needed more time to my tastes and the dessert wine was, as expected, too sweet for our tastes). We bought two of the wines with the hope that they will make the trip home.We stopped in Pyrgos on the road to ancient Thira. I wandered into the back alleys to take a picture of one of the beautiful blue domes churches. I kept going in and up a little further to try and get a picture without electric wires in the frame. It is a beautiful little village that seems relatively un-trampled by tourists.As we reached the road to Ancient Thira we were struck by how many many switchbacks made their way up the hill. We started to drive it but quickly became intimidated and backed up to get more information before continuing. It was good that we did as it was already 2 PM and the site was closed. Pictures did not seem to show that much was visible of the Roman settlement so we probably won’t try and get there on this trip. You can take a mini-bus up and back for 10 euros or up for 7 euros. It is a 2 hour tour.Instead we went to Kamari beach where we read, worked on sudoku and crosswords and napped. We did not end up going into the water as the sand/rocks were both hot and hard on my feet when I went down to the water barefoot. We watched with fascination and fear as some kids (at least some of them American) jumped from a nearby cliff into the water.We drove back to thira and on to Ia. We did get lost on the way back to Thira on a road that was not well marked. The good news is that with the shape of the island it is hard to get very lost. The road is spectacularly winding and high between Thira and Ia. I was not looking forward to driving back this route in the dark.We parked in the first lot we came to in Ia although it was 3 euros. I was relieved to be off the road so it seemed like a bargain. Ia is a beautiful town, probably the prettiest we have seen on the islands. The shops were more expensive (it reminded me of Carmel) so the shopping was not as good as in Thira. I took what would have been 2-3 rolls worth of film if I were not shooting digitally. We saw a couple different wedding parties and one model shoot taking advantage of the beautiful scenery. We found a perfect spot at the Sunset restaurant and ate pasta, greek salad and a chocolate souffl� as we watched the sun going down. It was a lovely sunset but since we are from the west coast a sunset over the water may not strike us as unique. The people watching was the real show. There we some tensions as people jockeyed for position.After the sunset we wandered back to the car and drove back with a caravan of buses back to the other part of the island. It was difficult to see any of the signs at night be we made it back to the hotel and parked the car with no major incidence. I was glad we had waited a day to do this drive as I was less rusty driving a stick and the drive back involved starting from a full stop on a hill more than once.Santorini – May 28We had signed up to do an excursion today to the volcano islands in the center of Santorini. A van picked us up at around 11 AM and took us to the port of Athinios. Here we boarded a traditional greek sailing vessel (although we did not use the sails) in the bustling port. We laid claim to a table in the sun on the top deck. The passengers represented a number of nationalities and we were impressed when te tour guide gave every announcement and informational presentation in English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German and French. He did so without notes. We made a quick stop at the port of Fira to take on additional passengers. We noticed he was definitely saying Fira instead of Thira. He told us the real name of the island is Thira and of the town is Fira although they get confused is all manner of ways according to him.We motored to the larger of the two volcano islands called Nea Kameni (new brunt island). We hiked up the volcano to the top which is about 120 meters. We stopped at 3 points where we could both catch our breath and learn more about the volcano. It was a hike but people at least 20 years our senior made the hike. The volcano has a high amount of silicon in the lava so it is very viscous and when it erupts it does so in violent explosion in the fashion of Mount Saint Helens. Our guide dug down a few inches at the top of the volcano and dug up hot wet soil. The volcano is still active and pulls in and heats sea water around it. The soil is mostly the pumice type of lava (What the Hawaiians call Ah Ah versus the flat smooth black lava called Pahoihoi). Many of the lava flows on the volcano still looked jagged and fresh. Half of the island had been created in the last hundred years. There was very little vegetation on the island. Santorini has had numerous volcanic eruptions as well as earthquakes. We learned that the earthquake in 1956 flattened much of the island except some of the troglodyte houses (caves dug into the rock). The Greek government needed to intervene which brought the first roads and electricity and setup in that way the infrastructure for tourism.The largest known eruption was the one 3500 years ago that buried the Minoan town of Akratiri and sent tidewaves as high as 150 meters high that also destroyed much of Minoan Crete. The tour guide said that some people think that Santorini may be what Plato referred to as Atlantis (although Plato put Atlantis past the gates of Hercules which is Gibraltar). He also said that some has speculated that the 10 plagues from Genesis may have had their origins in the eruption at Santorini. The map he had of Minoan Santorini showed an almost circle island with one opening which would been have a natural harbor and would explain why this was a major trading port.We then sailed to the smaller of the two volcanos Palea Kameni (old burnt island) where there are hot springs. Warm springs would be more accurate as there is an inlet warmer by 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 Celsius) than the sea water. The springs are high in iron and the mud is a rust red (and the water left was very metallic taste in your mouth). We anchored near the hot springs and you had to swim 30 meters to them from the boat. The water under the boat was 8 meters deep but, as another tourist pointed out, after the first couple of meters it does not matter. I had brought my underwater camera so I was able to shoot some video during the swim. Some people were using the mud to give themselves a mud bath. We would have loved to stay a little longer as it was nice to be in the water.The next stop was Thirassia. Joan and Liz decided to stay down by the port while I made the hike up the hill into town. I made the mistake of forgetting my water bottle as was starting to overheat by the time I got to the top on a warm day. I did find a small shop where an elderly woman sold me water. I was glad I had done the climb but there was not much to the village. It was not as picturesque as some of the other villages we had seen. There were a couple of restaurants and one was grilling some meat that smelled very good. After looking around and downing .75 liter of water I hiked back down to find the ladies. I ended up just grabbing an ice cream to supplement the water and ham and cheese sandwich we had bought on the boat. The “beach” at Thirassia was very rocky so none of us ended up getting the water.We sailed back via Ia, where most of the passengers got off to watch the sunset, and then back to port. There was some confusion as there was no bus for us to take but we ended up getting a ride up the cliff on another bus and met our bus driver at the top. When we got back to the hotel we swam and then went to dinner. We ordered a meatball dish that was not on the menu but that the people at the next table had ordered and souvlaki. That still left room for a candied fig which was the complementary dessert and for a chocolate souffle. After all the hiking, sun and a second glass of wine complements of Costas I crashed pretty early while the ladies watched a movie on the laptop.Santorini to Heraklion, Crete – May 29With no excursion planed and no rental car we checked out and then grabbed the bus to Fira. The system took us a little by surprise since we did not pay until we got off the bus in Fira so we stood there for a while we our money waiting for someone to be interested. An older gentleman on the bus would cross himself 4-5 times each time we drove past a small church which can keep you very busy in Greece.We bought some time at an Internet cafe to catch up on email. I only had 700-800 new messages (not counting another 800 spam caught by my filters). I also downloaded some podcasts since I was all caught up. We then went to the post office for stamps. I don’t know if our experience was typical but if it was you might want to pack a picnic lunch before heading to the post office.We walked through Fira doing some shopping for gifts as we hiked up towards Firostefani. What looks like Fira is actually 3 different villages that have grown together. The other two villages are uphill from Fira. There is a lot of new construction all over Fira but in particular there are a number of new looking and nice looking hotels clinging to the cliffs in Firostefani.We took the bus back to the hotel and then got a ride to the ferry from Costas. On the way there was saw 4 cruise ships off the coast of the island. Costas said that in the high season he has seen as many as 15. The port of Athinios is a crazy place with ferries, bus, trucks, vans, and taxies all coming and going within a fairly small space.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/trip-journal-greece-athens/,Trip Journal – Greece (Athens),Greece,"London to Athens – May 23We flew out of Stanstead airport north of London on Aegean Airlines. To make a 10:20 AM flight we set an alarm for 5:30 AM. We took the underground to the Liverpool station and a caught the 7:40 AM Stanstead Express. We arrived at Stanstead at around 8:20 and by the time we checked in and made it through security we only waited a few minutes before our flight boarded. I was surprised how busy this airport was. We stood in line waiting to check in looking at all the other wonderful places that people were flying.Flying into Athens the landscape reminded me of the golden (brown) hills of Northern California.We arrived in the Athens airport and were immediately hit by the smell of cigarette smoke as we entered the terminal. I guess Greece has not joined the anti-smoking bandwagon yet. Joan’s suitcase lost a leg somewhere between London and Athens (for the second time as it broke but was fixed by Holland America last November). We had to try a second ATM to get euros as the first one required a smart chip in the ATM card.It was simple to get on the Athens Metro at the airport and ride it into town although since we got in around rush hour the train got very crowded by the time we got downtown. We rode the subway to the Metaxourgeio station in the neighborhood where we were staying which was not the nicest neighborhood in Athens. We saw more of it than we should have because my “short cut” led us 5 blocks out of our way.Our hotel was inexpensive (around 60 euros a night) but that was probably a bit too cheap. The Hotel Albion smelled of smoke of course, but the elevator and room also had more of a mold or mildew smell. The elevator had a very definitive way of stopping and starting that worked better if you bent your knees to cushion the shock. The room had 4 beds and a large bathroom, but the bathroom had no shower stall, just a shower and a drain the the floor. At least two of the beds had cigarette burns on the sheets. There was a quite large balcony and the room was better when we opened the 3 sliding glass doors. The hotel did have a fast Internet connection, the air conditioning worked, and the TV got at least one channel in English (and a few porn).We ate out at a local restaurant which was almost empty but my Souvlaki was good. The bill came to the right amount but strangely had nothing to do with what we ordered. The waitress had done this intentionally, much to our surprise. We walked some on the busy Konstantinou street which was well lit and well trafficked. It was a mixture of shops, restaurants, the national theatre, a porn theatre and a sex shop or two. At night a few of the newsstands at Plateia Omonoias spread out their porn displays.When we got back to the room we shared the laptop and the Internet connection and watched some old Steven Segal movie because it was in English. We found out that with the schedule for ferries and flights to Santorini we either had to leave in the middle of the night on Monday morning or catch a ferry earlier than we had planned on Sunday afternoon. Could we see everything we wanted to see before then? Our hotel did encourage a faster departure. We also were unable, to our surprise, to actually book a ferry online. We found a hotel in Santorini we liked but needed to work out our travel plans first.Athens – May 24The hotel served breakfast from 8 AM to 9 AM so we got up at a decent time and ate the full (if uninspired) breakfast of bread, a boiled egg, a small croissant, cheese and ham. We were the only ones at breakfast.We got a day pass for the metro which only cost 3 euros each. We never saw anyone checking tickets on the Metro. We grabbed a train to the metro station in the Monastiraki neighborhood. We strolled through the flea market area on the way to the Ancient Agora. We bought a day ticket to all the ancient sites for 12 euros (vs 3 euroes for each site). Liz was free because she is a student.We decided, on Joan’s recommendation, to hike up the Acropolis first before the day got any warmer. It looked quite far up and the day was already warm. We were surprised that it did not seem like that bad a hike. Smart vendors sold cold water, parasols and postcards to hot tourists. There were places to stop like a large marble (slick) rock with a view of the Agora and city. We saw Mars Hill where the book of Acts talks about the Apostle Paul speaking to the Athenians. We also stopped to look at the ancient theatre (Herodes Atticus). Between the breaks and the ever swelling crowd of tourists the hike was slow enough that we did not get winded. We did get separated in the melee with large tour groups. Smokers and the very over-weight seemed littered along the side of the route. Once the climb was over there was plenty of space at the top of the acropolis for all the tourists. There were also facilities, drinking water and a nice breeze. I was glad we had come in May instead of the heat of August. The Parthenon is covered with scaffolding as they effect repairs on the structure but that did not distract from the fact that we were at the Parthenon! This seems like one of those places to see before you die and did not disappoint. The view of Athens was also incredible.We hiked back down. Joan’s knee was now sore and swollen (she has had knee surgery to try and grow more cartilage). We explored the Agora some before we found a lunch place just off the Agora. The people watching alone was worth the price of admission as we watched the stream of locals and tourists alike. We ate at a restaurant that featured crepes but seriously suspect they might only have one crepe pan as the crepes came one at a time at ten minute intervals. Liz was fashion shopping for dresses on the passersby.In the early afternoon we shopped our way through the Plaka. Joan and Liz both found affordable jewelry but did not end up buying any of the sandals for 5 euros. Meanwhile I would pop in a out of the other ancient sites along the route like the tower of the winds in the Roman Agora and Hadrian’s Library. After shopping from one end of the Plaka to the other we stopped for ice cream and then headed through the National Gardens to Syntagma square to watch the guards (and show of tourists) at the tomb of the unknown soldier.We stopped at a ferry company on way but they only had an early morning ferry to Santorini so we hopped on the metro again to the port at Piraeus where we were able to book passage on a 1 PM fast ferry on Hellenic Seaways. To get seats in Non-smoking we had to buy VIP seats but that was still cheaper than flying and the time was much more convenient. They were not able to book a ferry from Santorini, only from Pireaus which again surprised us.On the way to the hotel Joan bought a replacement suitcase from a local vendor. By the time we got back to the hotel for a rest before dinner I had sweated so much in the warm weather that I had gone through several bottles of water and had a layer of salt on the back of my shirt. Again, I am glad we came in May instead of the heat of the Summer.After a break we headed back to Monastiraki for dinner at a restaurant that had been in the family for 6 generations. It seemed like they could still learn a few things as they did not seem to number tables so people would walk around with someone’s dinner calling out “Souvlaki!” , “Mousakas!” or “Pasticio!”. Joan ordered the Pastisio which I think is close to what we used to call “hot dish” where I grew up.Joan tried to get enough towels for each of us for morning as they only seem to put two hand towels in the room everyday but they said they were out (even though the hotel seems practically empty). The only TV show in English was Rambo when we returned to the hotel, so we watched that, surfed the web and booked a hotel in Santorini.Athens to Santorini – May 25Liz was up half the night scratching bug bites which she had received in Athens. We all seemed to have been munched on to some degree.I got up at 8 AM and skipped the hotel breakfast for a croissant on the way to the National Archeology Museum which was the last site on my short list for Athens. I enjoyed seeing the museum, especially watching the evolution of Greek sculpture from the early forms into the classic period. It is quite a large museum and easy to get lost in. I was able to see some of the murals from the Minoan civilization from the dig near our hotel on Santorini.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/3-things-to-do-underwater-in-roatan-honduras/,"3 Things to Do Underwater in Roatán, Honduras",Honduras,"Roatán, a small island off the coast of Honduras and the largest of its islands, is the first place I ever set foot in the Caribbean and I’ll never forget that breathtaking view of white sandy beaches and crystal clear water that greeted me when I arrived at my seaside hotel.I’d have been happy enough to simply wander the island for the week I was there and take in more of the stunning scenery, but the most beautiful part of the island is actually the bit that you can’t see from the surface – the colourful and vibrant sea life below.So here are my recommendations for 3 great ways to take in the underwater sights at Roatán  this summer…Image Source1) SCUBA Dive the Barrier ReefRoatán is a popular diving destination and it’s no wonder when you consider that it’s right by the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second largest barrier reef in the world.This barrier reef is made up of more than 65 species of stony coral; many people mistake coral to be an underwater plant or even a stone, but it’s actually a tiny little animal with a hard shell, like a barnacle, that grows and lives in huge groups or colonies.Over time the little critters die and new ones grow on top, gradually, over millions of years, building up the beautiful corals that you can see today. No one knows why they sometimes grow in funny patterns like my favourite, the brain coral, but it’s an amazing sight to see nonetheless.The sad news is that many corals are extremely sensitive to temperature changes and global warming is threatening to kill them off, so if you want to see one of nature’s biggest marvels before it’s too late I’d suggest making Roatán your next holiday destination of choice.There’s also plenty to do for non-divers as well. You can always snorkel above the reef and try to spot all of the 500 species of colourful fish that live there, or there’s always the option to swim with dolphins – which was just as amazing as everyone says it is.Image Source2) Take a Glass-Bottom Boat TourAfter 5 days of diving we decided to take a break and see the sea-life in a much more relaxed fashion – in a glass-bottomed boat.Book a tour at Foster’s West Bay Resort, by the famous West Bay beach. West Bay beach is arguably the most beautifully and classically ‘tropical’ beach on the island and they have one of the coolest glass-bottom boats I’ve seen.You’ll sit in single file along this narrow boat with glass panels on both sides and, if you’re lucky enough to get the first seat, in front of you too. Then just sit back and relax as you get to see life as it happens under the sea, without getting wet or needing a SCUBA license.Be warned though, if you’re claustrophobic the single-file seating will make it near impossible to get up on top deck for a breath of fresh air once the rest of the passengers have filed in.Image Source3) Take in Some Underwater HistoryThe  Bay Islands Underwater Museum in Roatán is a unique experience; it does exactly what it says on the tin, giving you the chance to see ancient artefacts buried under water so you’ll need your snorkelling gear out for this one.Tours are grouped on an ability-basis so there’s no need to worry if you’re not an apt swimmer or you’ve got children with you, plus the whole thing is no deeper than your average swimming pool back home.Swim along behind your tour guide as he shows you ancient Mayan treasures, statues and even the shipwreck of a sunken galleon from centuries gone by. Exploring this hidden world is truly breathtaking and an underwater camera is highly advised.If you love the sea as much as I do, I’d also recommend that you find a hotel like the one I stayed in, which was less of a hotel and more like a group of individual log cabins on stilts above the sea. It was great after an exhausting day of adventure to fall asleep in a hammock above the ocean, in true Caribbean style.I’d love to hear from other people who have visited Roatán and find out what your favourite part of the island was, so leave me a comment below…This article is provided by Hotelopia, the perfect place to book your next holiday in the sun.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/croatia-island-hopping/,Croatia Island Hopping Itinerary – 2 Weeks in Paradise,Croatia,"A two-week road trip around Croatia’s islands is a dream come true. This is a classic idyllic day on the Adriatic; driving along the coast, sailing on a ferry, enjoying the fresh breeze and the Adriatic Sea views – what more could one ask for?The islands are what put Croatia on the tourist map. They are the jewels in its crown, from the crystal-clear waters to the bedazzling pebble beaches to the food (yes, Croatia’s food is amazing). These are the three main reasons why you’ll fall in love with this country.Our road trip starts in the port of Rijeka, where you can hire a car (you can check out some really affordable car hire deals here). Jadrolinija is the leading ferry service in Croatia (you can check out the local lines here).Then we’ll head to Island Krk and continue our trip south, finishing at Island Hvar. (And yes, we’re skipping Dubrovnik – it’s overrated and overcrowded. Hidden gems are the best!) The islands are an ideal escape from the intense tempo of modern life. This road trip has been my summertime staple for the last ten years, and it never disappoints.If your idea of a good time consists of being dynamic, adventurous, and constantly on the move, then island-hopping is for you.Ok, let’s do this! Let’s start exploring Croatia’s stunning islands.Island Krk – BaskaThe easiest way to get to Island Krk is by crossing the Krk Bridge. It will take you less than an hour from Rijeka. Krk is the biggest Croatian island, and its foodie scene is smoking hot. On the way to Baska, you have to stop in Milohnici at the restaurant called Konoba Pod prevolt to try out their local foods and dishes. Absolutely delicious!I recommend you check out Airbnb for a nice and comfy apartment in Baska. Baska is one of the most alluring and bedazzling sea cities you’ll ever experience. Most of the beaches are exposed to open sea and surrounded by pine trees. The main beach in Baska is a lovely pebble beach which is suitable for families with children. I’ve known this beach for a very long time – longer than I would like to admit – and it has left me with some really nice memories.The second best thing about this place is the food. You don’t have to drive far to have a great meal. There are numerous restaurants in Baska, and they offer everything from pizza to grilled squid stuffed with prosciutto and Swiss chard with potatoes. And don’t forget to try their pancakes; they make the best pancakes in the world in this tranquil old town.If you’re more into hiking, you have three options: Uvala Vela Luka, Obzova, and Uvala Vela Draga. Baska is hidden among the mountain slopes and has more than 90 km of hiking trails. The views of the islands Rab, Cres, and Prvic will take your breath away.You will most certainly enjoy the hike to Uvala Vela Luka. To reach the beginning of the track, head to Bunculuka Camping Resort, where you can park your car. On the left side of the camping resort, you’ll see a marked path that leads to Vela Luka Bay. There’s a restaurant at the Vela Luka, and their food is to die for.Island Cres & LosinjThe fastest way to get to Cres is by ferry. It will take you 2 hours to get there, and another 45 minutes to get to Mali Losinj. Once you cross a small bridge, you have reached your destination. Losinj is an enchanting island known for its healing climate. It was a beloved spot for famed 19th-century Croatian botanist Ambroz Haracic. Additionally, when Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Josef was stricken with tuberculosis, he packed his bags and took a 6-week detox holiday to Losinj, because it was so renowned for clean, fresh air.The island’s best-known beaches are located in the Cikat Bay. However, if you don’t like crowds, I recommend you plan your trip in September.Besides being the Island of Vitality, obscure, and unspoiled, Losinj is a paradise for children. My holidays (if I can still call them holidays) have changed significantly since becoming a parent. Parents will surely understand this. When you have children, you travel to destinations that are family-friendly – and Island Losinj is known to be an extremely child-friendly island. There are numerous playgrounds around the island, but the one that your kid will love best is a hidden playground right behind the Tower of Veli Losinj. Trust me on this one.For a pleasant hike, there’s about a one-hour-long hiking trail that leads to Osojscica. The trail begins in Nerezine, and you’ll need good trekking shoes for this one. There are lots of snakes, but no poisonous ones. View from the top is amazing.Island PagWhen you reach the island Pag, watch out – especially at night – because the sheep are everywhere, blocking the road, even taking a nap on the road. Crazy animals! But they are the reason Pag is called the Island of Cheese. Paski sir (Pag’s sheep milk cheese) is sharp and salty, and my absolute favorite.On the Southwestern part of the island, you’ll find a small fishing village called Simuni. Right beside the village is Camping Simuni. I recommend you book a bungalow or mobile home here. If you’d like to spend an active family day at the beach, Camping Simuni provides numerous activities – sports, animations, and entertainment for your little ones, spa for you, etc. If you prefer quiet, you can walk just 5 minutes out of the camping resort, where you’ll find two secluded beaches – both nice and clean with turquoise waters.When you get hungry you can drive around the island in search of homemade Paski sir (cheese), or stay in the camping resort – there’s a small restaurant called Tom’s Grill– it’s cheap, the service is fast, and the grilled sardines are out of this world.If you’re up for some hard-partying, remember, you’re on the Croatian Ibiza, and Zrce Beach is only 10 km away. Several discotheques are operating during summer months in Zrce. They host numerous world-known DJs, and Zrce’s Papaya Club has been voted by DJ Magazine as one of the top 100 venues in the world.I prefer jogging in the morning. Head from Simuni down the main road towards Zrce. When you reach the village Kolan, head left and then stick to the left until you reach the main road again. It’s an hour-long run, but at the end you’ll be able to jump into crystal clear waters at the camping site.Island Dugi OtokWho needs Seychelles when you have Dugi Otok? Dugi Otok, meaning “long island,” is indeed long. A ferry ride from Zadar to Brbinj takes about 2 hours – but read a good book, and it will feel like a second.Sakarun is the island’s most famous beach, but it can be overcrowded – especially in high season. That’s why it’s best to plan your trip in May or September so you can have the whole island to yourself. If you’re traveling in July or August, you’ll need to be a bit more creative and agile. You can find lots of gorgeous empty beaches with bright glittering waters on this island. Just 10 km from Brbinj is Veli Zal – uninhabited, untouched and wild.I love to eat at Konoba Regula – it’s a family-run restaurant, and they serve the best black risotto and scampi.Island HvarHvar is an island of vineyards, pine tree forests, and charming beaches. It offers something for everyone: crazy nightlife for party people and tranquil hidden bays for those who seek solitude. But it can be rather expensive – especially the city center of Hvar. That’s why I recommend you stick to small villages if you don’t want to spend money like it’s water while you’re here. You can find lots of beaches off the beaten track near the village Sveta Nedelja.While you’re here, search for Zlatan Otok – the winery Plenkovic has won hundreds of awards and is one of the top-ranked in Europe. (Not to mention their food.) Wishes here really do come true.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-amazing-must-see-places-2017/,6 Amazing Must See Places for 2017,Croatia,"“The gladdest moment in human life, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands.” – Sir Richard BurtonSummer is almost upon us and for many, that means thinking about our yearly vacation. The budget airline revolution and strong US dollar have made it more affordable than ever to take that dream trip. So where should you go? Whether you’re a lay on the beach type or a cultural city explorer, this list has something for everyone. Here are 7 excellent places to blow off steam in 2017:1. PortugalAlta Duoro PortugalThe oft-forgotten gem of Western Europe, Portugal has rebounded financially since the global recession. The capital, Lisbon, is in the midst of a gastronomic revolution, making the most of fabulous fresh fish and local products of the lush Mediterranean climate.Lisbon is a city of contrast, in which, the sublime black and white tilework clashes with red clay rooftops and the vibrant azure of the Rio Tejo delta.To the south, the stunning grottos of the Algarve are dotted with secretive beaches.In the North, you’ll find Porto at the mouth of the river Douro. The birthplace of Port wine and home to some the world’s best vintners. A Douro valley cruise is a must for true wine enthusiasts, and a delightful journey for all.Overall, Portugal has a ton to offer in a tiny compact (affordable) package.2. Croatian CoastCroatia Coast, photo from pixabay.comCroatia’s tourism industry is just before the fever pitch. With a little help from Game of Thrones, Westerners are finally flocking to the gem of the Adriatic. The picturesque castle of Dubrovnik (you may recognize it as King’s Landing), sits on crystal clear inlets and alcoves.Locals recommend an island hop from Korcula, to Brac, to party central Hvar, and finally to Pag, where you’ll find stellar artisanal cheese. On Pag, you’ll feel a world away from your troubles on the barren rocky surface often likened to the surface of the Moon. Nearby Zadar is famous for a majestic sunset Alfred Hitchcock once lauded as “the world’s most beautiful.” Roman ruins are ubiquitous and especially worthwhile in the Istrian city of Pula, which features one of Europe’s best preserved amphitheatres.Croatia is fully recovered from the tumultuous 90’s and ready to take you in, it’s best to take advantage before everyone else takes notice.3. DenmarkCanal boat in Copenhagen, photo from pixabay.comIn the capital, Copenhagen, you’ll find an eclectic mix of the contemporary and the classic. The architecture offers a delightful clash between the ancient sea foam rusted copper roofs and modern compositions, like the flowing Opera House. The exploding food scene, likewise, ebbs between traditional open faced sandwiches, and the truly experimental creations of nouveau culinary legends. Copenhagen is also home to Mikkeller Brewing, which constantly pumps out some outlandishly delicious craft brews.Furthermore, Denmark’s second city, Aarhus, is the European Capital of Culture for 2017. The often-ignored locale is home to Denmark’s largest university so there is no shortage of vibrant, innovative culture, and nightlife.The typically Scandinavian architecture along the quaint riverfront is, in itself enough to merit a visit. The Danes speak excellent English and are very open to explaining their unique lifestyle.4. AustraliaSydney Opera House, photo from pixabay.comAustralia is a tried and true destination. The pristine beaches, world class surf, and fantastic cities have been attracting tourists for decades. So why now? The Australian Dollar has cratered making a traditionally expensive destination affordable for the rest of the world. Furthermore, global warming and pollution continue to threaten the gargantuan Great Barrier Reef with extinction. Close to ⅔ of the reef is in danger of deadly “bleaching”, so there’s no time like the present. Budget airlines and economic trends make now the time to visit the land down under.5. CanadaBow Lake – Banff National Park, photo from pixabay.comCanada is celebrating a big birthday this year. 2017 marks the nation’s 150th year, and gives you a reason to visit the second biggest country in the world. From Vancouver in the West to Prince Edward Island in the East, Canada consistently delivers beautiful natural wonders. Alberta’s Banff National Park is well worth a visit.The cultural capital of Toronto is a cosmopolitan metropolis with a completely idyllic mixture of people from all over the planet. The contrasting Montreal is an enclave of a singular Quebecois mind-set, where you can find francophone food and a proud local heritage. Likewise, the languishing Canadian Dollar makes it a great time to join in the birthday party.6. ColombiaSalento Colombia, photo from pixabay.comBest known in the 90’s for a slew of cocaine fuelled violence, Colombia has calmed down in recent years. Growing interest in the drug kingpins, spurred by numerous documentaries and Netflix’s Narcos, has made the interior cities of Bogota, Medellin tourist attractions. It’s finally safe to visit their exquisite rolling hills.Former rival Cali, is the jewel of the pacific coast, and Cartegena is the capital of the post Columbian Caribbean. A rising star is the oldest inhabited colonial city of Santa Marta where you can see history in motion. Colombian cuisine and culture is in the midst of a velvet revolution and it could be cool to see a small part of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/haiti-a-journey-of-hope/,Haiti – Volunteer Travel in the Aftermath of an Earthquake,Haiti,"EarthquakeOn January 12, 2010, a severe earthquake (magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale) shattered the heart of Haiti and practically destroyed the capital city of Port-au-Prince.  An estimated 270,000 people died, 300,000 were injured, and a million more were displaced.  An entire nation affected.  You’ve seen the images on TV.  But let me tell you how it was on the ground… a different story.AftermathI had the opportunity to go to Haiti and assist with earthquake relief in February 2010, arriving just a month after the earthquake.  Having seen the images on the news, I braced myself for the worst… and I was surprised.  Yes, the devastation was unimaginable. Yes, the loss of life and suffering of those who survived were horrendous.  But I was surprised by the hope and the joy of those left behind, spared from the rubble.  So many people came up to thank me for helping them in their time of need.  So many more struck me by their strength in the midst of pure chaos and devastation.I was impressed with the dignity of the Haitian people and their unfailing hope for their struggling nation.  Despite losing loved-ones and their homes in the earthquake, so many people told me they were blessed to be alive; to have some of their family remaining; to have a job to support themselves and their family; and told me that they were looking forward to seeing how God would use this incident to turn their country around for Good…  As one of my fellow aid workers said,“The Haitian people that I have had a privilege to meet have shown me that faith is for people who have recognized their weakness and found strength in the only place where true and enduring strength can be found.”Help ArrivesAfter a long journey to get to Haiti (a red-eye flight to Florida, an entire day in an airport terminal, another flight to neighboring Dominican Republic where i spent a couple nights awaiting transportation into Haiti, and finally a long eventful 12-hour bus ride with other medical relief workers to Port-au-Prince), I joined the relief team that I would be working with for the next 2 weeks, at a rate of 18-hour days 7 days a week.  Food for the Hungry (FH) is a non-governmental organization based in Phoenix, AZ but has offices all over the world.  They started doing relief work in the 1970s and had an office in Pétionville, in the outskirts of Port-au-Prince Haiti before the earthquake hit.Haiti has been struggling since long before then, and FH had an HIV/AIDS program in place.  When the earthquake happened, they were in a good position to offer immediate assistance.  The FH team grew from 24 people at the time of the earthquake to 86 by the time I left Haiti, not counting the medical teams coming in and out from Canada and Korea.What did I do while I was there?I started working with a medical team from FH Canada (3 doctors and 3 nurses) and we ran mobile medical clinics in some of the hardest hit (but neglected) areas of Port-au-Prince (PAP), seeing 350 to 400 patients a day.  We would set up in the morning and work hard until about 4pm when we would simply have to close up even though the line of people needing care never seemed to diminish.Then we would drive around town trying to find the necessary supplies for the next day of clinic. We’d take a short meal break and then start organizing supplies for the next day: packing pills into individual rations… splitting mebendazole tablets by hand (no pill cutters available! the simple things you miss in those circumstances) for pediatric doses… and debrief about the day as we worked until about midnight, sometimes even 1 or 2 AM.  And then up again with the sun at about 6 AM, some breakfast, fill up our water bottles and make a small sandwich for a lunch/snack and off again for the day.Once the Canadian team left, I continued my work of gathering medical supplies, preparing bundles of medical supplies & pharmaceuticals to deliver to various partner hospitals in the area that were still trying to function amidst great need and chaotic circumstances.  I worked as staff nurse for the growing number of FH workers (some internationals but mostly locals) and vaccinated some 86 people against meningitis in just 2 days, as well as provided medical care to those employees who needed it.I worked on coordinating & preparing upcoming medical teams from the US and Canada by gathering and compiling the necessary (but not yet existing) briefing kit for medical teams (including what to bring, what to expect as far as traveling, lodging and working conditions, as well as all the logistical information and suppliers in PAP).  I worked on gathering feedback from prior medical teams in order to share the information and learn from past experiences in order to better prepare the next teams to arrive.I was the contact person for FH to link with the UN healthcluster and attend the daily meetings at the new UN camp next to the airport whenever possible.  I started networking and assessing health needs and resources of the various target communities FH was working in.And I started a project with a South-African supplier in order to build a temporary hospital in Siloe (one of the poorest and hard hit neighborhoods of PAP, but also neglected by the major relief organizations as it was hard to access and unmapped).  This supplier is able to provide modified shipping containers and set them up as medical exam rooms and even operating and delivery rooms.It was a very full 3 weeks (including travel days) with some interesting twists.  Such as the day I was out with a pick-up truck delivering medical supplies to a hospital and was approached by an American doctor looking for some gauze and some injectable painkillers to prepare a patient suffering from a complex leg fracture for transport as she was to be airlifted out to Miami for surgery… so I started digging through the boxes of suppliesI had just packed and got him what he needed.  And as the ambulance who was supposed to transport the patient to the airport never arrived, we ended up loading her into my pick-up truck which served as her ambulance that day.  Or the morning I received a cooler filled with 100 vaccines which had just been driven across from the FH office in Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic) and needed to find ice STAT in order to preserve them from the sweltering heat until I could use them.As most of you know living in this area [San Jose, California], and perhaps remember how you felt in the events of Loma Prieta, a major earthquake isn’t an event that just stops… aftershocks continue for weeks and even months after the initial blow.  While I was in Haiti, we experienced some pretty major tremors (4.7 and 4.5 on the Richter scale) which continued to do damage, both physically and emotionally, to people already suffering great loss.And then, just as I was leaving, the rainy season was beginning a full month earlier than usual and flooding the camps of displaced people, causing more injury and loss.  It’s been almost 5 months since the major earthquake, but the Haitian people still need much help in recovering and rebuilding their country.You Can HelpYou can help.  Not everyone can take 3 weeks off work like I did to go to Haiti, but all of you can contribute to the relief efforts following major catastrophes like the one in Haiti, but also to others in the US and in the world.  I encourage you to find out how you can help and get involved in your community.  Also, I would like to use this opportunity to remind you about earthquake safety for yourself should a major event hit your area.For more information visit:Food for the HungryFH Relief blog Partners in HealthMedical Teams InternationalAmerican Red Cross International Committee of the Red CrossShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/should-cruise-ships-go-to-haiti-in-defense-of-royal-caribbean/,Should Cruise Ships Go To Haiti? In Defense of Royal Caribbean,Haiti,"I have read a number of stories and countless twitter posts recently about the the “Haiti cruise ship scandal”. The issue is that here less than one week after Haiti has suffered a major earthquake and while people are still digging out what may total 200,000 bodies, Royal Caribbean is disembarking cruise ship passengers on Haiti at its private beach at Labadee. That is clearly wrong and immoral! Right?MIAMI – January 15, 2010 – Royal Caribbean Cruises, one of Haiti’s largest foreign investors for almost 30 years, today announced its plans to provide at least $1 million in humanitarian relief to Haiti in response to the catastrophic earthquake in Port-Au-Prince. Royal Caribbean will be partnering with charitable organizations – such as Food for the Poor, Pan American Development Foundation, and the Solano Foundation, the company’s foundation in Haiti – to provide additional assistance to the people of Haiti. Royal Caribbean will also be delivering much needed goods and supplies to Haiti via their cruise ships.Leslie Voltaire, Special Envoy of the government of Haiti to the United Nations said, “Given the terrible economic and social challenges we now face in Haiti, we welcome the continuation of the positive economic benefits that the cruise ship calls to Labadee contribute to our country.”The benefits start with Royal Caribbean International’s Independence of the Seas’ call today to Labadee, Haiti, which includes much needed supplies for the country. The supplies were loaded on the ship during its call in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and include items such as rice, dried beans, powdered milk, water and canned goods. In addition, 100 percent of the company’s net revenue from the destination will be contributed to the relief effort.DistanceIf Royal Caribbean started docking in Port-au-Prince and running “let’s go see the bodies” shore excursions then I think there would be general agreement that they were just exploiting the disaster and were getting in the way of the rescue efforts, but that is not what they are doing.I think it is a fair bet that cruise ships docked this week in Jamaica and Puerto Rico with no controversy at all (or at least the usual controversy about cruise ship travel). From what I can tell ships like the Grand Princess from Princess Cruises docked in Santo Domingo on the same island as Haiti in the neighboring Dominican Republic this week and that fact was not considered news worthy.Royal Caribbean’s private beach at Labadee is 83 miles from Port-au-Prince and Santo Domingo is 153 miles from Port-au-Prince. Is there something about that 70 mile difference that should make Royal Caribbean detestable and Princess just another cruise line. Certainly the fact that Royal Caribbean is coming back to Haiti itself seems to make the difference for many people.I live in California and have never been in an earthquake that killed 200,000 people but I was in the Loma Prieta earthquake that was almost as powerful as the Haitian quake. We ran into the same question about when is it OK to return to normal life. The quake happened in the middle of the World Series which was postponed for a week but even then it was controversial to continue the series. Should real life continue? Sure, but when and for whom? I can tell you that most people I know went to work the day after the quake. While they were still finding bodies most of us were doing what we did every day and I lived much closer than 83 miles to the epicenter of that quake.UnseemlyHaiti is poor. Haiti is dirt poor. In fact 2 years ago MSN wrote a story about the poorest of the people in Haiti eating dirt for nourishment. There are many factors as to why Haiti is poor including colonialism, bad governments, over population, a scarcity of resources. Most of us don’t like to see poverty.Some of the fuss about Royal Caribbean is that how can they bring rich cruises to such a poor island where poor people might watch rich people over-eating at the lunch buffet. Isn’t that tasteless at best? As I see it that emotional response is based on 3 things:Poverty is unseemly. Royal Caribbean is a cruise company and they are paid to take people some place. So they can decide to take them to Haiti or they can take them some place else. If they take them some place else then the rich and poor won’t have to rub elbows. That does not make the poverty of Haiti better, it just ignores it.Cruising is unseemly… at least to some people. For some the issue is not with Haiti but with cruise ships in general. The midnight buffet is a metaphor for a society based on over consumption and excess. I get that point of view even if I don’t completely agree with it. I have taken 15 volunteer trips to build housing and 1 cruise that stopped at a private beach (in the Bahamas). Let that ratio inform you of my personal travel preferences.Profit is unseemly… at least to some people. My first job after college was at Hewlett-Packard which had the reputation at that time as one of the most enlightened companies that was doing great things in its local communities. Knowing that, I was surprised when I learned that the number one item in the famous “HP Way” was “be profitable”. An aid worker can be of no help if they are not nourished. A company can be of no help if it does not make money. So we can cry that Royal Caribbean should donate all of its cruise ships or give more than the million dollars* that it has already pledged to earthquake relief but we need to understand that it is able to donate a million dollars because it takes people on cruises. It is naive to think that it will, could or should stop doing that.Royal Caribbean has brought jobs to 230 Haitians at Labadee. All of those employees are safe and accounted for. Jobs actually do help bring people out of poverty. Royal Caribbean has been involved in Haiti for nearly 30 years, before it was fashionable to do so, and will likely be involved still when the world’s attention moves on in a week or so. In my mind, whether you like cruising or loathe it that still makes Royal Caribbean part of the solution more than part of the problem so can’t we cut them some slack?Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/budapest-hungary-a-reason-to-love-europe/,Budapest Hungary – A Reason to Love Europe,Hungary,"I had a recent opportunity to tour Budapest on a romp through Europe. I was amazed and thrilled by Budapest, a city of amazing people and wondrous sights. The world heritage buildings, the churches and the bridges all somehow survived occupation by two regimes, and the city’s architecture is unique in Europe.As usual, I had planned my trip to the hour with a mind to experience everything Budapest had to offer. There really is no chance to see this city in several days, you need at least a week just for the major sights. The city is divided by the Danube into two areas, formerly distinct cities: Buda and Pest. The Buda side has hills overlooking the Pest, the Buda Castle and various museums.PestThe Pest side has majestic government buildings, the river walk with sightseeing boats, and the nightlife. There are three main bridges that connect the two sides: the Liberty Bridge with its green color and tram crossing, the Elisabeth Bridge named which is the main traffic bridge (named after the Hapsburg Queen), and the Chain Bridge, the most picturesque with the Buda Castle in the background. Just walking these bridges gives a sense of time and an amazing atmosphere. The most amazing sites were definitely the views from just about any location.Citadel HillI started my tour at the Citadel, which is a military building on top of Citadel Hill. The hill has numerous paved trails leading through the woods, offering small outcroppings of view, perhaps a statue, and leading down to a nice park at the base. If you go toward the Liberty Bridge, you are led to a very unique church called St Ivan’s. The entire church was hollowed out from caves in the mountain. Services are still held there and they are quite packed.Gellert Hill BathsAs you proceed down, you get to the famous Gellert Hill Baths. The Hungarians love their hot spring baths and they are also very crowded, even in the summer. They are a place of social meetings and the families can stay all day at one of the six huge bath complexes in the city.In Pest, of course, you must visit St Stephen’s church with the relic hand of St Stephen. There are many other sites nearby, though, such as the amazing and winding Hungarian National Museum. There is the Great Synagogue and nearby, the Great Market Hall with its shops inside a grand building.Along the Danube is the famous “Shoes on the Danube” sculpture. This sculpture commemorates a spot where the Germans in WWII would execute people. They would have them take off their shoes before they shot them and dumped their bodies in the river. Further the Parliament building. This can only be appreciated from Castle hill across the river as it is incredibly majestic, especially at night. At night, the whole area near the Chain Bridge is a haven for locals and tourists, offering great dining options, bars, and shopping.BudaOn the Buda side, there are the two hills: Citadel and Castle hill. Castle Hill is the home of Mathias Church (the Coronation church), and Fisherman’s Bastion, a colonnade built to view the city below. Castle Hill is filled with old buildings and shops and is worth a walk around.I did visit one very nice attraction there; the Labyrinth. This is a series of caves and tunnels under the hill, and the attraction is a must-see in the area. Inside the labyrinth, there is a tribute to Verdi, another exciting tribute to Dracula, a complete-darkness maze that you must walk through holding onto a line (very thrilling).The Budapest History Museum on top of Castle Hill is an amazing structure as well, incorporating the ruins of an old church into its confines. This was a highlight of my trip and, I think, unfortunately, many people pass it by. When you are done exploring Castle Hill, you can also take the funicular (tram) down to the base of the hill where there is a nice park to walk around.The city is quite walkable and I only took transportation when I was tired. There are buses, trams and subways everywhere so you can get around easily. There are 23 World Heritage sites in Budapest and you easily see them all in 3 or 4 days. Besides the sites, there are some amazing views and walks throughout the city. There are hundreds of cultural buildings, museums, churches in the area and all are unique.For instance, the House of Terror Museum which honors those lost in two periods of Hungarian occupation, and the National Gallery, a repository for amazing Gothic works of art as well as other Hungarian artists.Budapest is a city of wonder and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The food is also incredible. The goulash is just basically a meat stew but Budapest offers many other great dining experiences. The Pest shore has many boats that you can dine on while touring the river at sunset. The wine in this area is exceptional. The exchange rate, for US citizens, couldn’t be better right now so prices are very low.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/komodo-dragons-visiting-largest-lizards-world/,"Komodo Dragons, Visiting the Largest Lizards in the World in Indonesia",Indonesia,"As a traveler and nature-lover, I’ve had one thing on my life-list for years. I wanted to go to see the largest lizard in the world, the famous Komodo Dragons. They are found on only five small islands in Indonesia; Komodo, Rinca, Gili Motang,Nusa Kode, and yes… the inhabited island of Flores. Dragons are listed as a vulnerable species as there are only a few thousand of them and they are susceptible to various diseases in captivity. I was extremely lucky to step into a friend’s vacation plans and visit the Islands in his place. I can tell you the Dragons are everything I expected and more.First stop was the obligatory Komodo National Park to which you arrive by dinghy to a small dock. You walk around and up some rocky hills and into a camp with several buildings. We were greeted at the first outcropping with a small, seven foot long Dragon sunning himself. Being within a few feet of these amazing creatures is inspiring and they have an aura of quiet power around them. You can tell they are observing you just as you are them.We arranged for a guide and two additional rangers. The guide discussed the history of people with Dragons, their population, their behaviors and the protective measures currently employed. The rangers carry forked sticks with which they can push the Dragons. I doubt that the sticks would stop a hungry dragon but the locals are quite concerned for the safety of the Dragons. There is a legend that the Dragons are actually people that have been transformed so they treat the Dragons with a great respect as if they were relatives.The park is huge and there are many trails for hiking. We did not see Dragons on the hike but we did see Dragon nests. Dragons will dig nests for their eggs and then excavate many other holes all around to fool predators. Only a few Dragons will survive to adulthood. Juvenile Dragons live in trees mostly and hunt smaller creatures; snakes and birds. Two interesting facts about Dragons are that they often form pair bonds (strange for reptiles) and that females can lay viable eggs without males around (normal for isolated species). We saw were several water buffalo and monkeys, which are principal food sources for large dragons.There were several large Dragons at the camp when we returned from hiking. They stay mostly because the camp is in lowlands and there are rivers and other animals around. The camp also offers a small store which supplied me my much-valued “I was there” T-shirt.Next stop was a beach on Rinja Island. The crew had filled a bucket with raw chicken parts. I am undecided on whether we should feed wild animals but the tourist dollar is paying for their conservation, which is a good thing. We again used dinghies and rode up onto the beach. There was already one small, eight foot, Dragon on the beach. The guide assured me that the Dragons could smell the bucket of chicken. I believe that the Dragons knew the sound of the boats and came to the beach but they preferentially chose to go to the one boat with the chicken (and me) in it.The Dragons were salivating and encroaching on the food. While the most daring passengers, like me, were on the beach initially, there were soon five hungry Dragons there and we were forced to return to the boats. The largest Dragon appeared to be around fifteen feet long and could have weighed several hundred pounds. Dragons are venomous and their bite can cause excruciating pain. In addition, they seem to have no fear of anything; either man or animal. The guide assured us that they were afraid of one other animal, the wild pig. I found that hard to believe being close to these monsters. They are huge, mean and totally awesome up close. After we returned to the boats, we learned the bad news… Dragons can swim. Very exciting for all of us! With that, our Komodo Island trip was over and we left the land of the Dragons. This ranks as one of the most exciting and rewarding trips I’ve been on and one of the best experiences of my life. I have some amazing photos and some great memories from the Komodo trip.There are many amazing things to see in the area; the sights of Bali which is the portal to the Komodo Islands, the exotic people and culture, and, of course, the amazing Dragons. The trip doesn’t come cheap though. The flight for me was USD 2,000. While inexpensive hotels can be found easily in Bali, the trip to Komodo can be expensive as you need to travel to an area without any conveniences. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/3-off-the-beaten-path-destinations-in-indonesia/,3 Off the Beaten Path Destinations in Indonesia,Indonesia,"Indonesia has more approximately 14.000 islands and even though tourism is growing in Indonesia there are whole cultures that people are not connecting with. Here are three suggestions of off the beaten path places to visit in Indonesia1. Trunyan village in Bangli, BaliHow to get here:  To get to this village you have to actually rent a motorcycle and a boat to cross the river. Not recommended for those travelers on a budget, the fees can get until $300.Why:  In this village, there’s this kind of tree that can blur the smell of dead people’s flesh rotting go unnoticed. Deceased Balinese people aren’t being put into a coven, they are left under the tree with only white textile covering their bodies until their flesh and muscles rot away and only their skeletons remained. In that rotting process, not one fly or any other insects will get near that deceased bodies. And no flesh rotting odor will disturb the air surrounding the dead bodies either.I’ve attached a picture where the skeletons are stacked unto each other; gruesome but pretty fascinating. (Maybe I’m the only one who thinks this is fascinating. hahaha). Make sure you donate some money to this cemetery if you’re interested to keep them up and running. In Trunyan, you get a different sense of Bali from the usual Kuta or Seminyak culture scenes.2. Toraja, South SulawesiHow to get here:  Can only be reached by plane, from Jakarta to Sulawesi or any other big cities to Sulawesi. To go down South, rent a car.Why:  Fascinating cultures, two of them are Toraja clan and Bugis clan cultures. Toraja and Bugis are in one same place but they both consisted of a completely different cultural experience. They have beautiful wood carvings and architectures that dated back before centuries and they are still preserved until now, beautiful textiles and patterns that are special for that specific clan are also one of the reasons why to go down here.Another fascinating fact about how the Toraja clan treat dead people (I’m sorry, but as a local, I’m completely mesmerized at how in other parts in Indonesia can be so different from the modern culture nowadays that cultivated Surabaya or Jakarta), they put bodies in cages in the mountains. This culture lasts from 1700 years ago until now and somehow they also don’t smell. But unlike in Trunyan, there are no trees surrounding this mountain. Also, pictures attached.3. Tadulako, SulawesiHow to get here:   Tadulako is located in Central Sulawesi, in Palu exactly. To get here, rent a car and get a guide because most of Sulawesi people can’t talk English. Go to Palu first and then that’s where you can go to Tadulako. From Palu to Tadulako could take up until 3 hours.Why:  The Lore rocks that are believed came from the megalith times. Beautiful landscapes, and rocks. Big rocks. These Lore rocks are located in two places, in Lembah Doda and Pokekea. The carvings on the rocks indicated nature and humans, one big rock is carved similar to leaves which are believed to be the place where kings used to drink on or bathed on. There’s also this one mysterious rock that resembles couples, the local people believed, and there’s also a 2-meter tall statue that looks like a human.Another thing about Sulawesi: they have the best seafood! According to my father’s childhood stories, he used to live very near to the beach where you can actually just fish the fishes directly out of the sea and cook it in his house with Sulawesi’s special Rica Rica sauce. Sulawesi has special delicacies like Tuturuga; turtle meat cooked in spices if the meat is cooked alone, it tasted like this harsh textured soil taste (if anyone has ever tasted the ground before) but with the spices, it’s delicious. There are dog meat delicacies and bats meals too. If you’re in for a ‘normal’ meal there’s the special BBQ’d pork. Bali also has its own special spicy BBQ’d pork but Sulawesi BBQ’d pork is completely different; they have liver, carrots, and potatoes side meals, onion, and tomatoes sambal, and delicious cuts of pork’s flesh and crispy skin.If you’re in for a relaxing and soothing trip, try Gili Trawangan in Lombok, lots of other white sand beaches in Lampung, Situbondo (East Java), or most of Java, really. To see architecture from the Indonesian colonial era, you go to my city. In its east part of the city, many old colonial buildings still standing majestically and they’re all preserved and used as daily workplace, another famous museum that I really enjoyed is Sampoerna Museum; a museum about one of the oldest cigarette companies that still exist until now, beautiful presentation, very well-preserved museum, the Majapahit Hotel; famous for its heroic photograph in which a patriot bravely tore the colony’s flag down, or Jembatan Merah where lots of heroes fought British soldiers and because so many people died, the bridge is called “The Red Bridge” or “Jembatan Merah”.There are also lots of other undiscovered places in Indonesia (in total approximately 14.0000 islands are still undiscovered and experienced before) and I believe these are some of the most fascinating places a local could have ever experience. You get to see how Indonesia really was, before its colonial era. These places, I believe, are authentic in presenting how mystique Indonesia was on life and death.Some things I learned after discovering these places, were how I was not taking Indonesia’s cultures and spirituality seriously. As I teenager, I was used to living in an urban city, complaining from time to time how I want to get out of Indonesia and live somewhere else. I sense how Indonesia, in its most golden colorful history, has a big deal in the history of the world too. I also discover the ancient understanding of gods and religions, how they have an enormous role in why Indonesia became Indonesia in its present form.If you are an anthropology graduate, culture and history enthusiast, outdoor lover, food lover, wanderers or travelers I think you will enjoy these unusual experiences. I highly suggest you get a guide when you visit these places because they are ancient and some of them may not even talk Indonesian, let along English. Bring cash, finding an ATM that operates internationally may not be possible. Be sure to always follow the spiritual rules (like not stepping on this or that, bow when you enter a something sacred, wear a special shawl to get into some places, or fold your hands to pray) as these rules are taken seriously.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/a-culinary-trip-to-southeast-asia/,Southeast Asian Food Culture,Indonesia,"I have always been a big fan of food. I admit it. But not just any type of food, I like exotic cuisine. Common burgers and pizza were never my thing. As far back as I can remember, I have always been into things that are out of the norm in terms of food and enjoyed experimenting. Maybe that is the reason why I love to do food travels. That is, traveling to different countries in order to have a taste of their unique cuisine. I even keep something like a diary in which I put the records of all my food-related impressions.The best destination in terms of exotic cuisine so far, in my opinion, has been Southeast Asia. Countries like Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand offered me amazing treats that managed to please my palate like no other meals before. Following is a brief description of my food travel to these distant and marvelous countries whose meals had the biggest culinary impact on me.CambodiaThe Cambodian cuisine, also known as Khmer cuisine, is one of the world’s oldest. Cambodians are known for their passion for rice. As a matter of fact, they are the nation that consumes the most rice.A distinctive ingredient in many Khmer dishes is prahok, which many Westerners might find a bit pungent, probably due to its nature, which is actually a type of fermented fish paste. As unusual as it may sound, it is an almost integral part of the Cambodian meals. It took me a while to get used to its taste but put in the proper meal, it is quite good.As for the meals themselves, my favorite one proved to be Amok trey, which is the most well-known amongst visitors. A freshwater fish fillet is prepared with a variety of aromatic spices (pounded lemongrass, shallots, garlic, etc.), egg, coconut milk and roasted peanuts. All of this is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. The dish is not spicy at all but is very fragrant and zesty.IndonesiaIndonesian cuisine is rather diverse, mainly because of the fact that Indonesia is composed of about six thousand islands. However, just like Cambodia (and all other Asian countries), rice is an inseparable part of their meals. I noticed that Indonesians serve it both as a savory and a sweet food. Other staple foods they prefer include sweet potato, yam, and breadfruit.What impressed me a lot was the wide application of peanuts in many signature dishes – whole, ground or in the form of peanut sauce. My favorite Indonesian meal turned out to be the satay. Although it is also known in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, it originated in Indonesia. It consists of seasoned and grilled skewered meat served with sauce. The meat can be pork, chicken, goat, mutton, fish, etc. A variation made of tofu is also served. The sauce is usually soy-based.ThailandThai cooking is known to blend elements of several Southeast traditions. What I put in my ‘cuisine diary’ was that I noticed that most Thai dishes emphasize food prepared with strong aromatic components. Also, I learned (the hard way) of the famous spiciness of the local cuisine. The dishes in Thailand are famous for their balance of three or four fundamental food taste senses: bitter, sour, sweet and salty. Probably, I need not even mention the importance of rice in Thai cuisine. Its usage is as wide as in every other Asian country.As for my favorite Thai food… this is a bit tough to decide. I really enjoyed Kaeng hang-le, Bami haeng pet, but the one that appealed to me the most is Kai yang. It is basically a halved and pounded flat marinated grilled chicken. I believe that what gives Kai yang its special flavor is the special marinade, which includes garlic, fish sauce, coriander root, turmeric, and white pepper and the fact that it is prepared for a long time over a charcoal flame.I wish I could have included more meals in my report, but to be honest, I failed to remember the names of some of them (being in the locals’ language). After all, I tried so many dishes that in order to memorize all of them and their ingredients I would have needed to write a whole book. Bottom line, whichever country of Southeast Asia you might decide to visit, you are bound to be amazed by their cuisine. A true paradise for every foodie like myself.You can read more from Grace at http://www.vacationhomes.net/.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/borneo-for-wildlife-enthusiasts-6-must-see-destinations/,Borneo For Wildlife Enthusiasts: 6 Must-See Destinations,Indonesia,"For wildlife lovers Borneo offers unprecedented opportunities to see some of the world’s most enigmatic and fascinating creatures up close and personal. The scale of Borneo is astounding; it’s the third largest island in the world and houses rainforest that is over 130 million years old making it the oldest on the planet.As with many other islands like Madagascar and the Galapagos, this isolation from the mainland has helped life here to evolve in ways not seen anywhere else in world. Borneo consequently benefits from an astonishing level of bio-diversity which includes 44 species found nowhere else on earth. Is it any wonder, then, that Borneo has become a mecca for wildlife fanatics and photographers alike who flock here from the four corners of the globe?However despite the popularity of Borneo among naturalists it is still a far cry from civilization. Many of the resorts and hotels only offer basic accommodation while even getting here in the first place can present problems. For example very few direct flights exist and so most visitors end up having to catch a transfer from Kuala Lumpur.Be aware that the prices of flights can differ wildly depending on season and national holidays so if you’re considering Borneo as a possible holiday destination it can be well worth examining flight comparison sites to check where money can be saved.Getting here is just part of the problem; the island is so large that on arrival it can be difficult to know where to direct your attention. For the wildlife lover though, there are some clear highlights that no visit to Borneo would be complete without and that’s where we’ll be focusing our attention in the remainder of this article.1. Danum ValleyThe Danum Valley conservation area represents the largest area of undisturbed rainforest anywhere in Malaysia. The size and age of the jungle means it offers probably the widest diversity of wildlife found anywhere on the island and is home to some of Borneo’s most eclectic species including Sumatran rhinos, sun bears and clouded leopards.What impresses visitors to Danum is not just the volume of animals on display but also the ease with which they can be seen. The reservation offers over 50km of marked walks together with raised platforms through the forest canopy and carefully-orchestrated night safaris.However it’s not just the exceptional wildlife spectacles that draw tourists; the area is also home to some of the most stunning waterfalls in Asia, most notably Sungrai Purut with its seven tiered pools of water and 20 metre cascade.2. Kampung BilitWhilst African safaris have their “big 5” animals that every visitor hopes to see so Borneo also has a number of “headline species”. Of these the Bornean pygmy elephant must come close to the top of the list. Whilst the word “pygmy” may give an exaggerated impression of how small this species really is, they are noticeably more compact than standard Asian elephants. Scientists believe that this smaller stature has evolved to help the elephants move around in the dense undergrowth of the rainforest.Whilst pygmy elephants are present in many of the heavily forested areas of Borneo, Kampung Bilit is one of the best places of all to see them. Here they can be seen casually going about their everyday activities as they visit the many watering holes and river banks to drink, bathe and frolic.3. Kinabatangan RiverKinabatangan is Borneo’s second largest river and its banks nestle against Kampung Bilit. Here the main attractions are the water safaris where one can take a gentle boat-ride down the winding river. In doing so, you’ll gain an intimate glimpse into the lives of the local fauna from the comfort of your seat.Just as at Kampung Bilit, your chances of seeing pygmy elephants are excellent. Furthermore a range of other animals are frequently seen along the river’s edge including civets, orang-utans and pygmy hippos, not to mention the 420 species of bird present in Borneo.4. Selingan IslandKnown affectionately and unofficially as “turtle island” you won’t win any prizes for figuring out the main draw of Selingan Island. Daytime offers the chance to stroll gently along the expansive beaches or indulge in some snorkelling thanks to the clear, warm water and pristine coral atoll which seems to throb with sea-life at every turn.However it‘s at night that Selingan really comes to life. As the sun sets over the ocean, adult turtles drag their heavy bodies up the beach to lay their eggs. Alongside the vigorous digging, young turtles are hatching from nests laid months before and making a break for the safety of the ocean.Borneo is such a key area for nesting turtles that all this activity is carefully controlled by local marshals and experienced guides to ensure the perfect compromise between the turtle’s safety and your own enjoyment.5. Gunung MuluFor a truly jaw-dropping experience you can’t go wrong with the remote reserve of Gunung Mulu. Swathed in rainforest and boasting more wildlife than you can shake a stick at the real draw at Mulu are limestone caves on a scale that boggles the mind. It’s said that the largest of these caves, known as the Sarawak Chamber, could comfortably house 40 jumbo jets.Many of these caves link to one another underground so a subterranean walk beneath the surface of the rainforest can provide visitors with a truly memorable experience. Wildlife fanatics will be interested to hear that one particular site – Deer Cave – is famous for its vast colony of wrinkle-lipped bats, which can be seen streaming out of the cave at dusk in numbers too numerous to count.6. Sepilok Orangutan SanctuaryTo many people Borneo is synonymous with orang-utans and whilst orang-utans may be seen in many areas of Borneo your odds are best at the orang-utan sanctuary in Sepilok. Here, orphaned or otherwise displaced orang-utans are gently rehabilitated into the jungle and local guides provide food at raised platforms twice a day. These feeding stations almost guarantee you the best possible view of these impressive apes; surely a memory you’ll cherish for the rest of your life.This article was written by CheapFlights.com, to find cheap airfares please visit http://www.cheapflights.co.uk/Share this: "

Had it not been for two of the city’s great barley barons, Benjamin Guinness of the famous brewery clan, and Henry Roe of the Thomas Street distillery, we might be visiting ruins today. Their 19th-century contributions saved each church for their parishioners and our current enjoyment.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Christ Church CathedralChrist Church HistoryAnglo-NormansSt Laurence O’TooleCryptReformationThe Roe FamilySt. Patrick’s CathedralThe Guinness familyWhile Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese, over St. Patrick’s Cathedral, various monarchs through time took drastic actions against one cathedral in favor of the other. Christ Church is the elder of the two medieval cathedrals and it is originally situated within the walled medieval city. This made her susceptible to the laws and taxes of the city, from which St. Patrick’s was exempt.Christ Church CathedralDublin’s Christ Church Cathedral is the oldest structure in the city at nearly 1000 years. Its architecture is a mixture of medieval, gothic and Victorian. Through multiple renovations, stained-glass windows dominate. Attention to detail is noted in specific floor tiles of the cathedral nave. Look for the foxy friars. There’s space to explore above, as you climb the staircase to the belfry to ring the famous bells, and below, as you descend to the largest medieval crypt in Ireland. The crypt contains additional treasures of Christ Church, including priceless silver and, historically priceless, Ireland’s first copy of the Magna Carta.At the west end of the cathedral is a fully integrated stone bridge, a Dublin landmark, leading to the former synod hall. It had been built on the site of St Michael’s and was demolished by architect Street during his restoration of the cathedral. This hall, which incorporates the old St Michael’s tower, is now home to the “Dublinia” exhibition about medieval Dublin.The Very Reverend Dermot Dunne, Dean of Christ Church Cathedral believes firmly “the mission of any cathedral is to reflect through its beauty the transcendence of God … we welcome everyone as a pilgrim and it is our hope that as the pilgrim leaves, he or she will have been touched in some way by the love of God which shines in the beauty of this place.”Christ Church Cathedral, formally the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, only became part of the Church of Ireland following the English Reformation. The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin has used St. Mary’s on Marlborough Street as the “acting Cathedral” or ProCathedral for the past 200 years.Christ Church HistoryAccording to Tommy Graham, Editor of Ireland’s HISTORY magazine and the fastest walking and fastest talking guide you’ll find in Dublin, Ireland was labeled “Hibernia” by the Romans, meaning “land of winter.” Ireland was never conquered by the Romans, who, “having visited once, took one look at the weather, and assuming it was always this bad, left forever.”A church is thought to have stood at this Christ Church site since 800AD. Christ Church Cathedral, a wooden building at that stage, was founded in 1030, by Hiberno-Norse (old Irish for mixed Gaelic and Norse ancestry) King Sitric Silkenbeard after a pilgrimage to Rome. He was the Viking King of Dublin. By this time, the Vikings had become Christian.Purported to have four old Celtic Christian churches at this time in Dublin, only Christ Church and St. Martin of Tours lay within the walls of the Viking city. Christ Church, with its original architectural context, existed at the center of a medieval street pattern, a maze of small buildings and streets.Anglo-NormansJohn Cumin, the first Anglo-Norman archbishop, is thought responsible for directing the replacement of the existing Hiberno-Norse cathedral with the Romanesque and later Gothic cathedral. Parts survive today.The cathedral was rebuilt in stone in the 1170s by an Anglo-Norman feudal knight called Richard de Clare, the Earl of Pembroke from southern Wales. He’s better known by his nickname, “Strongbow.”Strongbow proved himself a statesman who had “thrown in his lot” with the Irish. He learned the language and took an Irish wife. His success depended on theirs, he helped Ireland benefit from Norman rule after diplomatically convincing most of the chieftains of Leinster. He died from sepsis from a foot infection.In the 1180s, the second Earl of Strongbow, Dermott McMurrough and other Norman magnates helped to fund the rebuilding of Christ Church. This included the construction of a choir, choir aisles, and transepts, the crypt and chapels to St. Edmund and St. Mary and St. Lô. McMurrough deposed the King of Lancaster and, in a sign of peace, promised the hand of his daughter, Aoife, (sounds like “Eva”), in marriage to Strongbow.St Laurence O’TooleOriginally, the cathedral was staffed by secular clergy. The second Bishop of Dublin introduced the Benedictines. In 1163, Christ Church was converted to reformed Augustinian rule by the second Archbishop of Dublin, later saint, Laurence O’Toole. While he tended his flock, removed abusive priests from office, opened the first Dublin orphanage and fed the hungry, up to 30 a night, he was involved in politics. He negotiated terms with Strongbow following the capture of the city in 1170.Laurence O’Toole died in France but his heart was transported back to Christ Church and kept until stolen in 2012. It was missing for 6 years but was returned to the Church by the burglars in 2018 after they suffered several family tragedies.A chapel to St Laurence O’Toole, now the patron saint of Dublin, was added in the 13th century and much of the surviving nave was built in the 1230s. Its design was inspired by the architecture of the English western school of Gothic, and, according to the Christ Church guide, its wrought Somersetshire oolite stones were sculpted and laid by craftsmen from the same area.In the 1350s a major extension was undertaken by John de St Paul, Archbishop of Dublin 1349-62. By 1358, the nave of the cathedral was partly in use for secular purposes and a “long quire” was added, extending the old choir area by about 30 feet. De St Paul also installed an organ. His works were destroyed by the major rebuilding project in the 1870s.CryptThe Christ Church underground held its own commerce. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Christ Church’s crypt was used as a market, a meeting place, and at one stage even a pub. It currently holds Ireland’s copy of the Magna Carta and several historic displays and treasures.The tomb of Strongbow was used as the venue for legal agreements from the 16th to the 18th centuries. It was meant to bind borrowers to their debts and enforce the bonds of society.ReformationThe Roman Catholic Church lost members following Martin Luther’s defection. On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther, angry with Pope Leo X’s new round of indulgences to help build St. Peter’s Basilica, nailed a sheet of paper with his 95 Theses on the University of Wittenberg’s chapel door.Perhaps inspired by this, in 1534, King Henry VIII broke from Rome over issues of divorcing his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. He established a reformed Church of England, which, in 1871, became the Church of Ireland.In 1539, the king converted the priory to a cathedral with a dean and chapter and worked to ensure Christ Church adhered to his new church structure. He officially dissolved the Augustinian priory in 1541. In 1547, his son and immediate successor, Edward VI, provided funds for an increase in cathedral staffing and annual royal funding for the choir school.In 1562, the vaulting of the nave roof collapsed, smashing Strongbow’s tomb (now replaced. the current tomb is a contemporary replacement from Drogheda) and emergency repairs left the north nave wall leaning out 18 inches further than the south. You can see it if you stand at the altar and look back. Those “temporary” repairs lasted until the 1870s when the Roe family stepped in to pay for repairs rather than allow their beloved family church to fall into ruin, following the example of the Guinness family 10 years earlier just 5 minutes away at St. Patrick’s.King Edward VI later formally suppressed St Patrick’s Cathedral. In 1547, its treasures were transferred to Christ Church, Queen Mary I, in 1558, had these items returned to Thomas Leverous, Dean of St. Patrick’s. Queen Mary, and Later King James I, later increased Christ Church’s endowment.The cathedral system of the Church of Ireland collapsed during the Cromwell period and Christ Church was provided a new constitution in 1660, modified since 1870 by the Church of Ireland’s general synod.In 1689, Catholic ex-King James II invaded Ireland and while there attended mass at Christ Church after and it was briefly returned to Catholicism. King William III who had replaced James in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 recaptured Ireland and returned the church to the protestant faith. He attended services here in 1690.The Roe FamilyWhile the John Jameson family is now the most famous for their whiskey, in 1832, George Roe inherited two distilleries, from cousins Richard Roe and Nicolas Roe, and expanded them. He founded the Thomas Street Distillery, the largest in Dublin, perhaps the world. At its peak, it was double the size of the Jameson factory on Bow Street. George and his sons George and Henry produced more than 2 million gallons of Irish whiskey annually by 1862. This large and prosperous business put the Roe family in a position of wealth and great influence.At the same time the Church of Ireland was established independent of the Church of England, in 1871, she was disestablished as the state church. The financial abandonment of the cathedral by the state left lay people responsible for the building’s maintenance and governance.George and Henry were approached about contributing the funds for the restoration of Christ Church Cathedral. By 1878, the family had donated £250,000, equivalent to $35 million today. They were subsequently knighted for their efforts.Henry Roe worked closely with architect George Edmund Street from 1871-1878 and encouraged the Victorian architecture we see today. Street, himself, commissioned the stained-glass window in the cathedral baptistry of St. Laurence O’Toole, in memory of his wife. George Roe commissioned the Jesse tree stained glass window on the north wall.The great 14th-century choir was demolished and a new eastern end was built over the original crypt. Informed tour guides are able to share additional changes. “The flying buttresses were added as a decorative feature. A new chapter house was built. The tower was rebuilt. The south nave arcade was rebuilt. The north porch was removed. The baptistry was built in its place.” Street built the adjacent Synod Hall, taking in the last remnant of St. Michael and All Angels’ Church, including the bell tower. The synod house is linked to the cathedral by Street’s iconic covered footbridge. This now holds DUBLINIA, the Viking tourist attraction.The Thomas Street Distillery, facing financial difficulties due to Scottish competition, American Prohibition and the Anglo-Irish trade wars, closed in 1926. It has recently seen some resurgence (watch for it and purchase their whiskey!)For most of their common history, both Christ Church and St Patrick’s held the status of a cathedral for the Dublin diocese. This was a rare arrangement in the Catholic Church yet only ended following the move to disestablish the Church of Ireland.St. Patrick’s CathedralIn 1191, St. Patrick’s Cathedral was built, outside the city walls, and named in honor of Ireland’s patron saint. St Patrick who, like St. Laurence O’Toole, spent part of his life in captivity. At 16, he was captured by pirates and spent 6 years as a shepherd. He escaped, returned to England, then was called to preach and returned to Ireland to convert the pagans to Christianity.This cathedral, built from 1220-1259, is positioned on the site of an ancient well, thought to have been used by Patrick himself. The building replaced an earlier, also probably wooden, church.The clergy of the church is uncommon. Archbishop John Comyn, an English non-priest was elected by the clergy in 1181 to Archbishop of Dublin following the death of Laurence O’Toole. Comyn elevated Saint Patrick’s to Cathedral status. This was unparalleled in the Roman Catholic Church and possibly only allowed because of the internal issue over the great Schism of 1054.The credit for St Patrick’s construction goes to Archbishop Luke, Archbishop from 1219-1260. He was actually blind by the time the work was complete, so he never saw the full fruits of his efforts. Luke built a Gothic cathedral in a cruciform shape; with the main body of the church (known as the Nave) resembling the long part of a cross, the top of the cross known as the Choir, with the arms of the cross known as the Transepts. The tour guide said the design for Saint Patrick’s was based on Old Sarum Cathedral, near Salisbury in England.After the English Reformation, Saint Patrick’s became an Anglican Cathedral. Modifications were made to its interior to suit Anglican standards. Many statues were removed. Decorations were stripped from the ceilings. Like Christ Church Cathedral, St Patrick’s suffered further during the reign of Edward VI. The Cathedral was demoted to the status of a parish church and was used as a courthouse and, for a short period, as a university. Queen Mary restored it to cathedral status in 1555. She allocated funds for repair and restoration.At this time, there are three statues of St. Patrick within the church. One statue, on the wall, was piecemealed together from three separate forms. Another is kept under glass across from the first. The third is a statue near the entrance. In the back of the church, you see the 39 stained glass windows that represent St. Patrick’s life.The Guinness familySir Arthur Guinness, along with his wife Olivia Whitmore Guinness, opened the Guinness Storehouse in 1759. Their brewing process takes barley and hops and clean water and turns it into a dark beer enjoyed billions of times a year. They were great philanthropists who helped form Dublin as we meet her today.His grandson, Benjamin Lee Guinness (3rd son of Arthur 2 and Anne Lee), continuing the family legacy, was part of St. Patrick’s congregation and volunteered all funds needed for the restoration with one caveat. As an amateur architect, he insisted he be given free rein at the renovations. Under fear of destruction and loss of priceless artifacts, the cathedral’s dean, or head of the church, Henry Pakenham acquiesced. The renovations were completed under the watchful eye of Pakenham’s successor, John West.In 1860, Benjamin spent approximately 150,000 pounds (appx 21M euro today). For his endeavors, he was made baronet, with title passing to his son, Benjamin, and Benjamin’s son thereafter.It was Benjamin’s daughter Ann that married the Dean of the Cathedral. You can find her visage on a stained-glass window to the right of the altar behind the main choir. Under “her” window is the biblical quote, “I was thirsty and Ye gave me drink.” You can’t say the Guinness family didn’t have a sense of humor.For the next five years, the Cathedral was closed for restoration. Guinness added a new ceiling to the nave and raised the floor to match the choir level. He removed all the screens between the nave, transepts, and choir.When St Patrick’s reopened, the church appearance was highly celebrated. The Guinness family continues to contribute to its maintenance.Benjamin Guinness diversified his financial holdings, specifically toward the Irish rail system, thus saving his fortune from the market changes that caused the Thomas Street distillery to close in the 1920s.Tied through history, the Guinness family eventually incorporated the St. Patrick’s Tower from the original Thomas Street Distillery. This Tower, a 150 ft high brick-built windmill, is believed to be one of the oldest extant smock windmills amongst European windmills. It’s nearly as recognizable in Dublin as the Guinness St. James Gate.Thanks to these two families, we have the ability to visit these awe-inspiring architectural marvels. These two barley barons saved the grandest cathedrals in Dublin. The Roe family lost their business due to economic events they couldn’t control while the Guinness family learned to maneuver through those events to become an even stronger company today. Overall, the public are the winners. The gratitude owed them, to allow us to see these cathedrals thanks to the philanthropy of the Roe and Guinness families, cannot be overstated. Funding for ongoing renovations comes from our admission fees to the cathedrals. Donate more if you can, every church needs a new roof before you realize it – save these cathedrals for the next generation.Contact:Christ Church CathedralChristChurch PlaceDublin 800 353 1 677 8099St Patrick’s CathedralSt Patrick’s Close, Wood Quay, Dublin 8, Ireland+353 1 453 9472Resources:Ireland Under The Normans 1169-1216 -, Volume 1By Goddard Henry OrpenTour Guides from each Cathedral[amazon_link asins=’B008ZIFNFG’ template=’ProductAd’ store=’chrischrissho-20′ marketplace=’US’ link_id=’ 603d5d03-08bc-40cd-a2dd-3e858eb1b7d9′Share this: "

Few hotel rooms make me laugh out loud as I did at a recent hotel stay at the Muckross Park Hotel in Killarney Ireland.Muckross Park Hotel – see reviews | check prices at Expedia | Booking.com | AgodaI am in Ireland speaking at the TBEX Europe event and they put me up for this trip at the Muckross Park Hotel just outside of Killarney. I always appreciate a nice hotel room but don’t expect to open the door and find a living room larger than I have at home, complete with a bar, two couches, and a flat screen TV. I was staying in the Tower Room Suite which also boasted a balcony and a bathtub large enough to invite guests.Muckross Park Hotel Room – LibraryThe original hunting lodge on the site of the Muckross Park Hotel became a hotel at the beginning of the 1800s. It was the first hotel in the area with 4-6 rooms and a thatched roof. It likely had no flat screen TVs and very slow internet. The hotel has seen major renovation since that time… for obvious reasons.The current hotel has a spa as well but I did not get a chance to try out the spa.The Tower suite is not the fanciest suite in the hotel as that honor goes to the Presidential suite (where friend of the show Gary Arndt stayed) or the George Bernard Shaw suite named after the famous playwright who frequented the establishment.The hotel has a bar and a high-end restaurant, the Yew Tree, on site. I had dinner in the Yew Tree.I can highly recommend the Beef Cheek at the Yew Tree which was so tender that no sharp knife was needed. The restaurant would be an ideal location for a celebratory dinner. There is also a pub next door if that is more your cup of tea… or pint of Guinness.The Muckross Park Hotel is across the street from Killarney National Park and located near the Muckross House, the 19th-century mansion from which it derives its name.The hotel has 4 different event spaces and is popular with wedding parties. There are certainly more mundane rooms than the Tower Suite if you are not looking for luxury in the manor to which you would like to become accustomed. But I can highly recommend the hotel and the service at the hotel if you are up for a spluge.Muckross Park Hotel – see reviews | check prices at Expedia | Booking.com | Agoda Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/hotel-review-castle-kilkea-hotel-county-kildare-ireland/,"Hotel Review – Castle Kilkea Hotel – County Kildare, Ireland",Ireland,"I have always wanted to stay in a castle, but I have to admit I thought castles would be drafty and cold with suits of armor and slow wi-fi. I didn’t expect the kind of luxury hotel I found in Kilkea Castle in County Kildare, Ireland, only an hour or so from Dublin airport.Kilkea Castle Hotel – check reviews | check prices: hotels.comI was invited to Kilkea Castle on a special preview weekend a few weeks before the castle opened for a travel blogger summit with Tourism Ireland. They pulled some strings and let us have a sneak peek at the way the other half lives.HistoryAmerican born owner Jay Cashman told us he was given advice “not to buy a big castle”. One can only imagine the upkeep that an owner would have with a larger castle, what with the moat, the dungeon and all. So instead he bought one of the longest continually occupied castles in Ireland.Kilkea was built in 1180 by Hugh de Lacy, the Earl of Ulster and the Chief Governor of Ireland. He built it for Walter de Riddlesford, a Norman knight. The Normans invaded Ireland in 1169 after they had consolidated their holdings in England over the previous century.As we sat in the fireplace room, Local storytellers Mario and Kevin Kennedy also regaled us with stories of Arctic Explorer Ernest Shackleton who was born nearby and whose home you can visit. Sir Raymond Priestly, Antarctic Explorer and Geologist, said of Shackleton and his contemporaries. “For scientific discovery give me Scott; for speed and efficiency of travel give me Amundsen; but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.” RenovationCashman is a Boston construction mogul and it is a good thing that he knew a bit about construction as the renovation from castle to luxury hotel took 5 years and 30 million euros. It was interesting still seeing the old arrow slits and narrow castle windows on the outside and comfortable (and warm) rooms on the inside. The castle has much better internet coverage than it likely did after its original construction.It still retains its old-world charm. The rooms have no room numbers but instead are named after history members of the original owners. I stayed in the Sir Thomas de Rokeby room which was named after the Justiciar of Ireland (English official) from 1349.We were told a few ghost stories about the Wizard Earl of Kildare who disappeared in the 16th century while showing off his magic to his wife. He told her that if she showed any fear she would never see him again. She passed that test repeatedly until she was startled by a black cat and her husband was not seen again… or was he. Legend says he returns ever 7 years to a haunted room in the castle. Our timing was off as our visit was wizard-less and ghost-free.ActivitiesWe practiced our archery where I was able to hit the target but learned I was no match for Johnny Jet who easily won the prize as the best archer in travel blogging.photo by Tammilee from TammileeTips.comWe also had a chance to talk to a falconer, Bernard Byrne, which was fascinating. I learned that the terms “at the end of your tether” and “hoodwinked” both come from falconry. We held but did not fly some of the majestic falcons that he brought. We also learned that when you are training a hunting bird you always have to have some treat to give the bird when you claim its catch lest it come to think of you as just someone who steals her food. You also don’t stare down a falcon as it sees that as a challenge. But how can you keep from staring at such beautiful birds?It is likely that many of the future guests of the castle turned hotel will come for golf on its beautiful 18 hole par 70 golf course built along the River Greese. We had a chance to eat at the new clubhouse which was a short procession (following a bagpiper) from the main building. The dinner was wonderful.In addition to golf, Kilkea Castle also has facilities for tennis, skeet shooting, horseback riding, hiking, swimming, tubing, cycling, fishing, birdwatching, and spa treatments.FoodSpeaking of food, Kilkea has hired chef Chef Ronnie Wolf who is a German chef with 26 years of experience. Besides the Bistro in the Clubhouse, Kilkea also offered us a beautiful well-lite large breakfast room, light lunches in the main living room with its cozy fireplace and dinner in a spectacular dining room. The dining room would be ideal for either a wedding banquet or a banquet with your lords and ladies.Meetings and EventsI was attending a meeting in Kilkea but also expect it to be a popular destination for weddings because… castle.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-touristy-things-that-i-really-liked-about-ireland/,7 Touristy Things That I Really Liked About Ireland,Ireland,"When visiting a country for the first time there are always many places to see and things to experience. How do you choose? Popular tourist attractions can often be a let down because they are so often overhyped that by the time you get there, you already know what you are going to see. Sometimes this is because you know so much about the attraction, the experience doesn’t feel new. Other times, it is because it is so crowded with other tourists, you do not feel any personal connection.This summer I took a trip to Ireland with my daughter. Ireland is famous for its touristy attractions, so it was with much trepidation that we scheduled many experiences that Websites, blogs, friends, and family said we had to go and see. Surprisingly, I enjoyed many of these. So here are my top seven touristy things that I really liked about Ireland.Guinness Storehouse7. Alcohol-Related ToursIt is not surprising that the Guinness Storehouse, the Old Jameson Distillery tour and the Irish Whiskey Museum are three of the most popular experiences in Dublin. In fact, alcohol-related tours are popular throughout the country. Admittedly, I am not a beer or whiskey drinker, but I have toured two Budweiser breweries in the United States and the Heineken Experience in Amsterdam, so I have some history with alcohol-related tours. In Ireland, I experienced the Guinness Storehouse and the Jameson Distillery. Overall, I was really pleased with both tours, and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is traveling to Dublin.The actual tour of the Guinness Storehouse began with a basic walk-through exhibit on the Guinness beer-making process, but the highlight for me was the 360-degree glass enclosure at the top of the Storehouse building called the Gravity Bar. It offered a spectacular view of downtown Dublin. In fact, while we were there, it was raining outside on one side and sunny on the other. After receiving a pint of Guinness, we hung around the bar for at least 30 – 40 minutes. I could have stayed all day. The views and atmosphere were the highlights of our day in Dublin.Guinness StorehouseI equally enjoyed the Jameson Experience where small groups and a tour guide were used to make everything feel more personal. It was housed in the location where a Jameson factory previously existed. The experience was very informative, interesting, and entertaining. I felt that I learned a lot and understood what makes Jameson unique among whiskeys. One thing that really impressed me at both locations was that a family (2 adults, 2 children) could purchase a special discounted tour ticket. Apparently, in Ireland, alcohol-related tours can also be a family bonding experience. In all, both tours were good fun and well worth the cost, time, and effort.6. Visiting Country HousesIreland has no shortage of country manor houses to visit. Every tour of Ireland should contain a few, but how do you choose which estates to visit? I had no idea. Our tour company suggested three that were in different areas of the country: Belvedere House in Westmeath County, Kylemore Abbey in Connemara, and Muckross House in Killarney. All three were excellent representations of country manor life in Ireland and had special features that made them worthwhile visits.Jealous WallAt Belvedere House it was the Jealous Wall, built to block a view of a neighboring house. At Kylemore Abbey, we really enjoyed the extensive Walled Gardens, and at Muckross House, we learned a lot by seeing the servant’s quarters. Each place was unique and conjured up enough Downton Abbey excitement to hold my interest.Kylemore AbbeyOne thing I did learn is that it is a good idea to spread these visits out every few days, so you do not become fatigued by looking at old houses. Also, it is a good idea to investigate what else the property offers in addition to the house. Whatever properties you choose, give yourself enough time to fully see everything.Kylemore Walled Gardens5. Walking the Cliffs of MoherMy visit to Ireland’s most famous natural attraction occurred on a very foggy day during a driving, windy rain. When we arrived, I wondered if it was worth walking up the hill to the viewing platforms around North Point and O’Brien’s Tower. I did, and there was no let-up of the rain and fog. I could barely see anything and the only photograph I took was of a small rock outcropping. It seemed like a total waste of time.Cliffs Of MoherOn the way back down, my daughter suggested that we keep walking to the South Platform. Amazingly, it looked a little clearer here, so we pushed on. Eventually, we got to the end of the protected walled area, but we felt adventurous so we kept going. We found that the Hags Head View was clearer, so we left the property and walked part of the Coastal Trail. There was a small wall here, but we were able to easily cross over to walk along the edge of the cliffs. Eventually, we had some clear views of the southern area of the cliffs. The north area was never clear.The lesson I learned was persistence does pay off and even though our visit was not the perfect scenic experience I was hoping for, it was not a total loss. Even though it was a dismal day, I gained a glimpse of the majesty that makes this attraction so famous.4. Seeing a Sheepdog DemonstrationSheepdogI have seen this type of demonstration before in the United States. It was entertaining, but it was not something I felt I had to experience again in Ireland. Admittedly, I was not too excited about going to see dogs nudging and nipping sheep around a field. We saw the Caherconnel Sheepdog demonstration presented at Caherconnell Fort in the Burren region.In true Irish tradition, on the day we attended, it was cold and windy with a steady drizzle that seemed to blow sideways from every direction. Even though we were able to watch from a covered pavilion, we still became very wet. Much to my surprise, this turned out to be a terrific experience. Not only was it interesting seeing Border collies do their work in their own environment, but the owner and trainer was so open and honest about his life and his dogs, that I truly felt I got a taste of an authentic Irish way of life. I’m not sure if it would have been better on a clear, sunny day, but I do know that a local talking about his life while standing outside on a windy, rainy day felt very authentically Irish.Ring of Kerry3. Driving the Ring of KerrySneemWhen you tell people that you are going to Ireland, everyone says you must experience the Ring of Kerry. Truthfully, I was not even sure what the Ring of Kerry was and why it was so special. I soon found out that it was an incredibly scenic drive through mountains, valleys, and part of the Irish coastline. We drove the section of the ring from Killarney to Sneem and were very fortunate that the day was mostly clear. It did rain a few times, but the clouds were high, so the views were very impressive. In fact, the mixture of blue skies and dark clouds made for very dramatic photographs. We stopped at Moll’s Gap, Ladies’ View, and Tork Falls.Muckross HouseOur final stop was a guided tour of the Muckross House. Our lunch stop at Sneem proved to be an excellent choice because there were many places to eat and the town itself had many scenic areas. Even though we backtracked from Sneem to the Muckross House, it did not seem repetitive since the views were incredibly scenic in all directions. I would rate this attraction a must-see in Ireland. It was dramatically scenic and well worth spending a full day or two. My only regret was that we did not drive the entire ring. I really wanted to see more.2. Listening to Music in a PubEveryone visiting Ireland looks for that authentic Irish experience of listening to a local band play Irish music in a small, cozy pub. It’s not always easy to find. There are many pubs that offer music, but sometimes they sound similar to many bars found in Boston, New York, or Chicago. I am a big fan of Celtic music and have attended many festivals throughout the United States. Many great Irish artists travel here to perform. In Ireland, I discovered that it was best not to focus on the quality of the music, but to get caught up in the fun of singing with the crowd at the pub. One touristy pub sing-along I enjoyed was at the Danny Mann Pub in Killarney. This is a very popular spot for tourists to visit. Amazingly, I enjoyed being a part of the crowd and getting caught up in the fun of singing the chorus to many Irish songs. Really, what could be more fun than singing “Courtin’ In The Kitchen” with a bunch of newfound friends?Blarney Castle1. Kissing the Blarney StoneThere is nothing more touristy than visiting Blarney Castle and kissing the Blarney Stone. Some people shy away from doing this because the idea of kissing a stone that multitudes of people before have placed their lips on, just sounds disgusting. I found that climbing the ruins of Blarney Castle was exciting and kissing the Blarney Stone was a lot of fun.After climbing the narrow, winding stairs to the top of the castle, I had only about a 10-minute wait to kiss the Blarney Stone. There was one person who took my photograph and another who helped me to lie on my back and hang down to kiss the stone. Even though they moved quick, both were helpful and patient with me. Looking down about 90-feet at a sheer drop below me, I was excited and terrified at the same time. It was very safe because there were strong metal bars to hold onto, and the area below the stone was covered with protective metal bars. Even though I knew I couldn’t fall, it still felt scary. Fortunately, it happened so fast that I didn’t have much time to worry.Blarney StoneAfter the castle, I spent a good amount of time walking the castle grounds. The extensive gardens and natural rock formations were beautiful and peaceful. I especially enjoyed the Poison Garden, the Blarney House mansion, and the Rock Close which included a simulated Druid Circle and mystical pathways. If you visit, make sure you include extra time to visit the gardens. The nearby small town of Blarney is very charming and also worth visiting. In looking back on my trip to Ireland, this was my favorite experience simply because I allowed myself to get caught up in the touristy excitement of this Irish tradition.The joy I reconnected with on my trip to Ireland was that sometimes it is okay to just have a little fun and be a tourist. There is a reason that so many of these sites have remained popular for many years. So when you plan your next visit to a new country, be careful not to approach the traditional tourist sites as an obligation. Allow yourself to be open to the anticipation and excitement of visiting a place for the first time. And rest in the knowledge that each experience (no matter how touristy) has the potential to enrich your understanding of people, culture, and the world. At the very least, it may just give you a great story and bring a smile to your face.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-journeys-home-andrew-mccarthy/,Book Review – Journey’s Home by Andrew McCarthy,Ireland,"A Review of Journeys Home: Inspiring Stories, Plus Tips & Strategies to Find Your Family History.Journeys Home: Inspiring Stories, Plus Tips & Strategies to Find Your Family History, starts with the story of actor, writer and director Andrew McCarthy and his many trips to Ireland where he learns more about himself than he thought he would. He recounts the story of finding a book by Frank O’Connor and the passion he had for making one of its short stories into a film. McCarthy’s section is full of stories about his discovery of parts of his family across IrelandOf the other stories in the book, the one that moved me the most is by Juan Jose Valdes. This section begins with his description of the day he left Cuba in 1961 and recounts the emotions of his return visit in 1999. Like when he discovered the map on the floor of the Hotel Nacional. Understanding that he had been there before standing at the map, but not understanding why or when he had been there. Later his father would tell him the map was his favorite stops when his parents had brought him to the hotel to dine with them as a child.Other places where authors journey in search of their ancestors include Angola, Croatia, England, Japan, Laos, Vietnam, Poland and many others. As this is a National Geographic book, the “word pictures” and descriptions or the people, places and cultures are fantastic. Since this is a National Geographic book, the pictures are also superb.At the end of the book is a section giving a guide on how to plan your own journey home. This section gives tips on how to organization the information. In addition, it talks about places to look that you might not think of. What may be the most important advice, manage your expectations.Genealogy Tourism is a growing part of the tourism industry consisting of people who have ancestral connections to their vacation destination. These genealogy tourists travel to the land of their ancestors to reconnect with their forefathers. Genealogy tourism is a worldwide industry, although it is more prominent in countries that have experienced mass emigration at some time in history and thus have a large worldwide community. For example, genealogy tourism has been prominent in Ireland for some time and a web search turned up several tour companies in Ireland to help plan such a trip.I really enjoyed reading this compilation of stories. Journeys Home is one inspiring story after another and has made me wish that my Great Uncle Archie had written such a story when he traveled to France tracing our family’s history.DISCLOSURE: I received a free Advanced Copy of Journeys HOME: Inspiring Stories, Plus Tips & Strategies to Find Your Family History in order to write the review.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/review-homestay-com-meet-locals/,Homestay.com Review – Meet the Locals,Ireland,"I had the opportunity to experience a home stay from Homestay.com when I was recently in Dublin, Ireland. For full disclosure, Homestay.com paid for this particular stay. The Homestay.com experience is a paid for, hosted experience so you are staying in someone’s home and you will get a chance to meet and interact with them during your stay. According to the Homestay.com web site, the stays around Dublin start at around $35 for a single room and typically include a light breakfast.I stayed in with Mic and Liz and their family south of Dublin and I will warn you that you can’t possibly have as great a stay as I did as I feel I need to put Mic and Liz on my Christmas list because I want to stay in touch after spending 3 nights as part of their home. Most nights I did not eat with their family and it certainly is not included in the price generally, but I did join my hosts for one evening dinner and then took Mic out for a pint a one of the local pubs so we could keep talking.One of the advantages of a hosted home stay is a chance to interact with locals. Granted the Irish culture is not that different from where I am from and the language is very similar except for that really cool accent. But even with all the similarities we found a lot to talk about how things work differently from one country to the other. We talked about school systems, traffic, business, the recession, the Celtic Tiger, sports, faith and much more.One of the questions I typically ask during an Amateur Traveler interview is “most memorable local you met”. Thanks to a home stay, from Homestay.com, I have my answer should anyone ask me.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/photo-walking-tours-dublin-dawn2dusk-tours/,Photo Walking Tours of Dublin with Dawn2Dusk Tours,Ireland,"David Cooke was a cab driver and amateur photographer. He used to get frustrated as he drove by tourists taking pictures. “I would say to myself, don’t they know there is a much prettier picture just around the corner”. Of course they didn’t, so Cooke started giving photo walking tours to some of the lesser known scenic spots in Dublin. I was fortunate to go on two of David’s tours (www.dawn2dusk.ie) when I attended the TBEX Conference in Dublin.South Dublin Coast TourThis tour headed down the coast of Dublin to a variety of beaches, piers, harbors and lookout points to capture pictures of the seacoast of Dublin.Sandymount StrandThe tour started at the popular strolling spot of Sandymount Strand. We visited at high tide but there is a large inlet of water known as the Cockle Lake here even at low tide. It was not the most scenic point of the tour, but as David promised, the tour is arranged to build from there.Sandycove – The Forty FootOriginally a gentlemen’s only swimming spot, bathers of all genders now enjoy the water here in the shadow of a Martello Tower. The Martello Towers were built by the English to protect against invasion in the 1800s. James Joyce lived for a time in this round stone tower.Dun Laoghaire HarbourDun Laoghaire Harbour is one of the largest harbors in the country and we walked the length of the East Pier to the lighthouse on the end as sailboats plied the waters of the harbor and fisherman brought in their catch of crabs for the markets of Europe.Bullock HarbourThis very tiny harbor would be easy to miss but we were able to photograph some of the local rowboats and fishing boats as well as some local rowing crews practicing. The Druids built a standing stone circle where the nearby village is situated.Caliemore HarbourAnother diminutive harbor with old boats lying about and families out fishing. Just 300 meters from the harbor lies Dalkey Island with another Martello Tower built to protect against French invasion before their defeat at the battle of Trafalgar. The island was occupied as early as 4500 B.C. and also has the ruins of a 7th century stone church.Killiney Hill ParkThis park was opened in honor of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee in 1887. From the summit of the hill (capped by the Killiney Hill Obelisk also known as the witches hat) there are beautiful vistas of the entire South Coast of Dublin which provided a fitting end to the tour. Dublin by Night TourI knew that this tour would be more challenging to my photography craft as I have always been challenged by night photography. This tour started at the Ferryman Pub on the River Liffey and then walked as far down as the Ha’penny Bridge where we crossed over the river and returned on the North shore of the river. Our tour was partially in the rain as we took pictures of graffiti, bridges, pubs, public art and life along the River Liffey.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/driving-ireland/,Driving in Ireland – A Road Trip to the Western Edge of Europe,Ireland,"I lost Kevin, the other driver, at the first roundabout. We had only taken 3 turns from where we picked up our 2 rental cars when he could not get over into the left lane of the roundabout and had to go around again. While we had worried about driving on the left and shifting with our left hand we thought we would do better about following one another. Not an auspicious start to a driving tour of Ireland.Cliffs of Moher, IrelandCarRentals.co.uk was kind enough to let us use not one but two cars to hold the eight of us traveling together. We had to pay for the collision damage waiver which is required in Ireland. I had expected that my credit card would cover that but apparently Visa wants no part of collision insurance in Ireland, Israel or Jamaica.We had done some things right:Both cars had a navigatorBoth cars had a device with a GPSBoth cars had directions to our first hotelWe had walkie-talkies which would keep us in contact as long as we stayed within a mile or so of each otherKilkenny, IrelandKilkennyKevin sped up and I slowed down so he could catch up. That should have worked but we apparently didn’t see each other as he sped by me so we quickly lost contact on the walkies. For the next hour or so I kept driving slow wondering why he must be driving so slow that he didn’t catch up. Meanwhile, he was speeding down the motorway wondering why I was driving so fast so that he didn’t catch up. We both made it to the B&B in Kilkenny. They got there half an hour before we did.Kilkenny was our first stop. It is less than an hour and a half from Dublin airport. While I had flown in a day early and was rested, Kevin was getting right off a flight from California. I recommend the former as a strategy. We took the last walking tour of the day from the Visitor’s center through the streets that still preserve a number of the medieval buildings, stopping at Kyteler’s Inn for dinner while locals watched the big championship hurling game.Rock of Cashel, IrelandCashelOur next stop was the Rock of Cashel which is the ruins of a fortress and cathedral on a large defensible limestone outcropping above the town of Cashel. Just driving up to the site led to exclamations of “wow”. One of the advantages of getting your own car is that you don’t have to arrive at the same time as all the other tourists in their tour bus. Our first half-hour at the Rock was much less crowded than after all the buses pulled up. We explored the area for a few hours and even walked to the nearby ruins of a Cistercian Monastery.Our host at the B&B the night before had recommended one of 3 routes from Cashel to Dingle that she said was “scenic”. I found that a bit amusing as every road we traveled in Ireland, at least once we were in the countryside, was scenic. We did have rain off and on because there is a cost for all that green.Chris outside an Iron Age Ring Fort, Dingle Peninsula, IrelandDingle PeninsulaOne of our goals for driving to the west was the drive around the Dingle peninsula to see old ring forts and churches from medieval Ireland as well as signs of habitation going back thousands of years. We also walked to the west edge of Europe at the end of the peninsula. The next parish from here is Boston. Even if you are only walking a quarter of a mile to one of the many ruins or to the famine huts always take a raincoat or an umbrella as this area gets 100 inches of rain a year.The motorways in Ireland have a fairly consistent labeling system. Most roads between towns are designated with a letter. The closer the letter is to the letter A the easier the drive. The M routes are the motorways or highways. They have 4 lanes with limited access and rival the roads we have seen anywhere else. The N routes are more local arteries. They tend to be 2 lane roads with lights and lots of traffic circles. There is generally plenty of room to pass oncoming traffic. The R routes get a bit more challenging. There is often a wall of rock or shrubbery on your left and passing oncoming traffic at some points will help explain to you why Ireland is a very religious nation. I swear on the Dingle peninsula we must have driven a few “Z” routes where someone could lean out both sides of the car and touch the hedges. These are the sort of roads that probably led Visa to say not just “no” but “hell no” on the collision damage waiver issue for Ireland.Cliffs of MoherWe arrived at the Cliffs of Moher at night. I don’t really recommend driving these rural country roads at night if you can avoid it. Nighttime is a better time for sitting in the pubs listening to local music while you work on a pint. We didn’t have any issues but the driving is more stressful at night when you know that a stone wall is two feet off your left.The Cliffs of Moher are a spectacular site. Since you don’t have to keep bus schedules plan on an hour or two to explore in each direction from the main viewing area. I would not recommend you tempt gravity as much as the folks did in this photograph, however. The cliffs are not as stable as people think and a few people die each year from getting too close to the edge.The BurrenCromwell’s surveyor described the Burren this way: “There is not a tree to hang a man from, water to drown one in nor dirt to bury one in”. But this “barren” area boasts numerous ring forts as well as a portal tomb, Poulnabrone dolmen that dates back to at least 2900 B.C. While not as barren as the southwest in the USA, the heart of the Burren is nearly solid rock broken up by channels cut by water every few inches which fill with grass.ConclusionWe found the roads to be well marked, with a few exceptions, but a GPS and a navigator were very handy. Dueling GPS systems between the two cars led to occasional confusion and banter over the walkie-talkies. We learned to appreciate the value of a good traffic circle and loved the freedom and sense of adventure that driving on our own gave us. And, when we turned the car in with only a few scratches from roadside shrubbery, we heaved a sigh of relief. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-a-fierce-local-by-harvey-gould/,Book Review: “A Fierce Local” by Harvey Gould,Ireland,"Harvey Gould, the author of A Fierce Local, is a pretty unlikely spokesman for Ireland. He is from Chicago, has no Irish relatives, and is Jewish. He married, somewhat later in life, an Irish-American woman from New York whose family had come to the US recently enough that not all memories of the old country had been lost. After a serendipitous meeting and a very long courtship, they got married in Ireland, and they have been visiting there, to the same town, so often that they became known as ‘fierce locals’.  ‘Fierce’ in this context means something similar to ‘wicked good’ in some parts of New England. Gould and his wife Karen have spent so much time in their small town (Adare, in County Limerick) that they know as many or more of the shortcuts as the people who live there, and are simply regarded as locals. The family they were renting a house from got to the point where they wouldn’t accept rent any more.Gould’s accounts of Ireland ring very true. I haven’t spent as much time there as he has, but my family never lost touch either, and I’ve been over there with my wife more times than I can count. His accounts of the Irish wit and humor, and roundabout way of getting to a point, and Oirish Time (Irish time), and near universal welcomes all jive with my experiences. It seems there’s only one person he met there whom he didn’t like – I’m fortunate enough not to have met mine. I love the descriptions of driving, of the rotten signage and confusing directions, and enjoyment of the back roads and odd little towns away from the main tourist attractions.There are several major themes that recur in the book, and they join one another in a near calamitous fashion.  The first is that Gould has been afflicted with a terrible blood disorder, myelofibrosis.  He was diagnosed with it in 2000. In the disease, to use Gould’s words, “the bone marrow becomes filled with scar tissue, leading to a host of chronic and eventually lethal complications.” One of the complications is that the body no longer makes enough red blood cells, and the lower the blood counts get, the less oxygen is available to organs and muscles and the more fatigue results.  Another is that the spleen, in an effort to make up the deficit in red blood, becomes a sink for blood cells, and grows larger and larger to the point that it has to be removed. Gould has far exceeded the expected survival of a myelofibrosis patient, although it did force him to give up his law practice and retire earlier than planned. At one point in the book, while in Ireland, he has an acute crisis where the hemoglobin in his blood falls to a dangerously low point, and he has to have massive transfusions, 12 units of blood, which is more blood than an adult really has, in order to bring it back up again. Afterwards, he petitioned the Taoiseach (“Chieftain”, or prime minister of the Republic of Ireland) to be certified as a full-blooded Irishman, which they seem to have taken much too seriously. Rare for an Irishman not to get the joke.Harvey Gould is still with us – I received a tweet from him a day or two ago. The median survival time for myelofibrosis is five years. I’m writing this review twelve years after Harvey’s diagnosis.The other major theme of the book is horseback riding, particularly fox hunt riding. Horses are greatly revered in Ireland, and Gould is an accomplished rider, including jumping and dressage. There are accounts of several hunts, and the author explains it in such a way that a non-rider such as myself can get a feel for what it’s like to ride a horse such as the first one he rode on a hunt in Ireland: “Seamus was bigger than our house in San Francisco.”  I especially enjoyed the description of the stiff leather strap across the front of the saddles.  Gould asked, “What’s that”. “It’s a Jayzuz strap. When yer takin’ a jump and you jest know yer about to come off you pray to Jayzuz, Mary, and Joseph to keep you safe as yer grabbin’ the Jayzuz strap.”  He didn’t have such a strap, but was doubtful that, as a Jew, he would have been eligible to use it. I know one thing for sure and that is I will never ride a horse, in Ireland or anywhere else, and certainly not in a hunt.  This book confirms that!The complicating factor is that the blood disease and the exertion of a day-long hunt are not really compatible.  Harvey does it anyway, and he does a good job of capturing what it must feel like. He was suffering from an enlarged spleen, in a very delicate state, but went on a hunt anyway, assuring his wife that he would fall on his right side, away from the spleen.The thing I liked best about the book is the way the author captures the language the Irish people use. The Irish love language, and they love to talk, and they love to take conversations in unexpected directions, and he captures all of that. Not so much the Irish language, although he does capture a little of that, but the musical and lilting way the Irish speak English is one of the most charming things about that country.Anyone interested in Irish society and culture, travel in Ireland, or in horseback riding would enjoy this book.  And the human interest of how Harvey Gould continues on after receiving his apparent death sentence is uplifting to everyone. Disclaimer:  A free copy of this book was provided with an expectation that the reader would write an honest and unbiased review of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/4-day-road-trip-in-israel/,"4 Day Road Trip in Israel – Biblical Sites, Ruins, Castles & Humus",Israel,"Where else can you see a crusader castle before lunch, a 9,000-year-old village in the afternoon and end the day sleeping near the house where Jesus grew up?Israel is a small country, which makes it ideal for a road trip. With surprisingly little driving and a surprisingly short amount of time, you can see much of the country. This is a good thing because on our trip to Israel we had four days and much to see. Here are some recommendations for a somewhat hurried itinerary:Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}JerusalemTel AvivCaesarea National ParkHaifaAcre AkkoTel Megiddo (Armageddon) National ParkNazarethCapernaum National ParkJordan River ValleyQumran National ParkEin Gedi Antiquities National ParkMasada National ParkConclusionJerusalemWe started our road trip in Jerusalem where we had already spent a couple of days seeing the sites including the Machane Yehuda Market and the old city (see Self-Guided Walking Tour of Jerusalem’s Old City).Tel AvivJerusalem is on the eastern edge of Israel where it meets with the Palestinian Authority, and Tel Aviv is on the western edge at the sea but the two cities are so close together that they share an airport. We got a ride to the airport from a friend and picked up a rental car. By default, a rental car in Israel will be a standard transmission but we were able to upgrade to a rather strange and kludgy robot automatic.Our first stop was Tel Aviv where we stayed near the beach and arrived in time to see the sunset over the Mediterranean. We stayed at the Abratel Suites Hotel which was pleasant with excellent service. We were there on Friday night, when some restaurants were closed at the start of Sabbath but had a nice meal at Olive Korner.The House of Simon the TannerIn the morning we walked down the wonderful esplanade to the south to the old city of Jaffa. Tel Aviv is a relatively modern city but Jaffa dates back to biblical times. It was in Jaffa where Peter the apostle received a vision that led to the acceptance of Gentiles like me into the early Christian church. There is still a house in Jaffa which claims to be the house where Peter stayed (The House of Simon the Tanner). It’s just behind a church dedicated to Peter.Abouelafia bakeryWe visited Jaffa on Saturday or Shabbat when many things in Jaffa and elsewhere in Israel are closed. We had a walk through the old town past some of the colorful shops with appropriate stops at a coffee shop and a delicious smelling bakery, Abouelafia bakery, where we picked up some baked goods for lunch.Caesarea National ParkAbout an hour north of Tel Aviv is Caesarea National Park, which protects a series of Roman ruins dating from the time of Christ. The city was built around the palace of Herod the Great, which later became the headquarters for the Roman governors. The apostle Paul was in prison here. The vision Peter saw in Jaffa led him here to the home of a Roman centurion.Caesarea National Park is a curious thing. As you walk in the northern gate you come to a series of shops and restaurants and a park area set amongst the Roman ruins. But if you head further south along the coast you come to a second entrance where you need to show your ticket, with an additional cost, to visit the main ruins. Here you’ll see ruins of baths and houses, a hippodrome where chariot races took place, and a reconstructed theater which is still used for performances today.When we bought our tickets we chose to get a six pack of entrances to national parks which was a wise decision. It gave us an incentive to look for other national parks along our route that we might have missed. If you’re going to be in Israel longer you can buy an unlimited national park pass good for 2 weeks.Nearby on a public beach is the remains of a Roman aqueduct, which now just gives shade to picnickers;HaifaBaha’i GardensFurther north along the coast you come to the city of Haifa, which is built on the slopes of Mount Carmel. The Baha’i Gardens, which are a UNESCO site, climb the northern slope of Mount Caramel. You can walk or rather hike the gardens or merely enjoy the beautiful view from the top or the bottom. We stayed at the Haifa Bay View Hotel at the top of Mount Carmel, not far from the top edge of the gardens. As the name suggests, the hotel did have an excellent view.For more information about all the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Israel listen to UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Israel and Palestine – Amateur Traveler Episode 558Acre / Akkoold fortress of the Knights Hospitaller – Acre / AkkoThe next national park and UNESCO site we visited was the Crusader town of Acre or Akko. When the Mamluks retook the holy lands from the Crusaders in 1200, the ruler, Sultan Baibars, built his castle on top of the old fortress of the Knights Hospitaller. He just filled the castle in with dirt and used it as a foundation. In the process he managed to preserve much of that castle for later generations, although that certainly wasn’t his intent.The Hospitallers cared for the sick and poor of all religions in Acre, when they weren’t busy squabbling with their Knights Templar neighbors. You should visit their large and impressive castle. I recommend the audio guide, which does a good job of explaining what you’re seeing even if you knew nothing (as I did) of the Knights Hospitaller.Old AkkoHummus SaidThe old city has more of an Arab population, so it has some really good hummus restaurants which are both tasty and inexpensive. We found the Hummus Said on Yelp and tracked it down the in the warren of streets that is Old Akko.Near the old harbor, there’s a tunnel built by the Hospitallers to access the harbor. There’s not as much to see here as at the fortress, and it is certainly not something I would recommend to the claustrophobic.Tel Megiddo (Armageddon) National ParkCistern – Tel Megiddo (Armageddon) National ParkLater that afternoon we visited another national park / UNESCO site Tel Megiddo. Archaeological digs on this mound have found not one city but city built on city built on city over the course of 9,000 years. The most impressive feature of Tel Megiddo is the cistern which was carved with hand tools into the rock, over 100 feet deep, and with a tunnel over 300 feet long to the water source.Cistern – Tel Megiddo (Armageddon) National ParkThis site is better known as Armageddon, its Greek name. Armageddon makes an appearance in the Bible as the place of the last battle in time. The plains outside Armageddon have seen many battles through the years as this was the route from Egypt to the rest of the fertile crescent.NazarethFauzi Azar Inn (by Abraham Hostels) in NazarethWe stayed in the Fauzi Azar Inn (by Abraham Hostels) in Nazareth, which is an old nobleman’s house. It is a beautiful building (though showing its age). We stayed in a private room up on the top or third story. The hostel is in the pedestrian-only portion of the old town, so you will need to be able to carry, roll, or drag your luggage here. If you are staying for longer than we did, Abraham Hostels also runs their own tours in Israel which are worth looking into. The hostel is surrounded by interesting shops and just a stone’s throw from the market in the old city with its many small shops and restaurants. You can certainly get souvenirs here though it’s also used by locals for their normal shopping.Church of the Annunciation GrottoChurch of the AnnunciationOne of the most beautiful churches we saw in Israel, and probably my favorite, was the church of the Annunciation in Nazareth. It is built over the top of a house which was believed to have been where Joseph and Mary lived with Jesus as a child. The builders left the ruins of the house standing in the grotto and built a modern church around them. The church is decorated with artwork from many countries depicting the “Annunciation” (when Mary is told she will have a child and that child will be Jesus).We were less impressed with the city of Nazareth itself. It’s certainly a busy city. Being unimpressed with Nazareth is not a new problem, Nathaniel in the Gospel of John, when he hears that Jesus is from Nazareth, says “can anything good come out of Nazareth?”.(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Capernaum National ParkPeter’s House Capernaum National ParkMany of the sites mentioned in the New Testament as places where Jesus did ministry are clumped in a small area of the northern end of Lake Kinneret (also known as Lake Gennesaret or the Sea of Galilee). Here you’ll find a house purported to be the house of Peter. More precisely you will find a church built on a church built on a house purported to be Peter’s. The house is located just steps from the lake, which would be handy for a fisherman.Feeding of the 5,000 ChurchAlso at Capernaum National Park are the ruins of the synagogue built on the ruins of a synagogue where Jesus likely taught. Just down the road from there is a church located on the traditional spot where the feeding of the 5,000 took place, just below the hill which is the traditional location for the Sermon on the Mount.Jordan River ValleyWe stopped for bagels at The Wisdom of the Bagel in Kinneret at the Bet Gabriel center at the southern edge of the lake.Belvoir Fortress / Kochav HaYardenAfter lunch, we drove up in the hills above the Jordan River to visit the ruins of a crusader castle at Belvoir National Park. This whole park only takes about an hour to see but has some beautiful views of the Jordan River Valley.View from Herb Farm GilboaWe spent that night at the Ein Harod kibbutz and dined on Mount Gilboa, where King Saul died, at a terrific restaurant called Herb Farm Gilboa.Baptism Site of Jesus / Qasr el YahudIn the morning we visited the baptism site of Jesus on the Jordan River (Qasr el Yahud). There is more to see from the Jordanian side than the Israeli side at the baptismal site (which I had visited previously including a visit accompanying the Pope). There are a number of churches on the Israeli side which are historic but still located in minefields. Israel has announced plans to clear those minefields and reopen access to those churches.Qumran National ParkQumran National ParkOur next stop was at Qumran National Park. Qumran was the community where the writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls lived. It was a religious sect that died out mysteriously in the first century. Likely they joined those rebelling against Rome and died down the road at Masada. Particularly noticeable out here in the desert was how many pools the community had for ritual bathing.The park is a great view of the community and history, but if you want to see the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves you will need to go to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.Ein Gedi Antiquities National ParkEin Gedi Antiquities National ParkPossibly the smallest National Park we visited was the Ein Gedi Antiquities which contains the ruins of a single ancient synagogue. The park takes all of 15 minutes to see, and the highlight is some of the excellent mosaic work from the floor of the old synagogue.The unexpected surprise was running into wandering ibex goats migrating past the park entrance.We drove past the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve which is much more popular than the antique area, but which we did not have time for on this trip. It is known as one of Israel’s best-hiking spots.Masada National ParkMasada National ParkMasada is an old palace, again built by Herod the Great, on a mesa in this desolate part of Israel. It has a great view of the Dead Sea and Jordan River Valley, but Herod built it more for defense than the scenery. He carved great cisterns into the rock and stored up years’ worth of supplies. These came in handy in the last act of the Jewish rebellion against Rome in 70 to 80.Roman camps, the line of the Roman siege wall – Masada National ParkAfter the Roman legions had already invaded Israel, sacked Jerusalem and captured the rest of the country, the last rebels held up here at Masada. From the top, you can still make out the square layout of the Roman camps, the line of the Roman siege wall, and the ramp which the Romans built to capture Masada.Roman siege ramp – Masada National ParkThe night before the final Roman assault, most of the defenders of Masada killed themselves. They preferred death as free men instead of life in slavery. For that reason, Masada is not just a historic site but has been a symbol for modern Israel and especially for the Israeli army. You are likely to see rambunctious squads of soldiers during your visit.Ambitious travelers can hike up the serpentine path to Masada while the less ambitious can take the gondola.Even if the story of Masada wasn’t so memorable, and even if the site wasn’t so historic, the stark beauty of the site alone would recommend going out of your way to visit it.There is a food court at the National Park which is good because you are a bit off the beaten path at Masada just as Herod liked it.ConclusionWe spent our last night again in Tel Aviv, this time at the Olympia Tel Aviv Hotel again near the beach. We dropped off our rental car at the airport and took a train into the main train station in Tel Aviv which is quick and easy, but in the morning we had a very early flight and hailed a cab back to the airport. It is surprising to me that there are not hotels by the airport itself.You can see quite a lot of Israel in a few days. Our entire itinerary would have taken just over 8 hours to drive if we’d driven it straight through. If we’d had more time we might’ve taken in more sites in the south or headed up to the Golan Heights. We certainly would have seen more national parks and maybe spent more time in Jerusalem.Our trip was a bit rushed and doing the same itinerary in six days would probably be more comfortable for most people. In the winter and spring, many of the national parks close at four or five o’clock and often close admissions to visitors an hour before closing time, so that constrained some of our visits.We saw a lot of old things, we took a lot of pictures, and we ate a lot of hummus, making it almost a perfect road trip.For more information about Israel listen to Travel to Israel – Amateur Traveler Episode 167.and Travel to Jerusalem – Amateur Traveler Episode 192 Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/walking-tour-jerusalems-old-city/,Free Self-Guided Walking Tour of Jerusalem’s Old City (with Map),Israel,"The Old City of Jerusalem is an amazing site and amazingly small when you consider all the significant sites it contains. It is around one square kilometer. I had a chance to visit Jerusalem for the first time recently when I attended the TBEX conference there. While I was there I took a walking tour from Sandeman. This is what I learned on that tour and on my own explorations.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Map Self-Guided Walking Tour of Jerusalem’s Old CityThe Ancient Walled CityThe Jaffa GateThe Tower of DavidThe Armenian QuarterThe Roman CardoThe Jewish QuarterThe Temple MountDavid StreetChristian QuarterChurch of the Holy SepulcherGuided ToursConclusionMap Self-Guided Walking Tour of Jerusalem’s Old City            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/Jerusalem.kml"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(15);    });  } The Ancient Walled CityJerusalem has been conquered by a great number of civilizations over the centuries including the Babylonians, the Romans, the Arabs,  the Crusaders, the Turks, and the British. When you look at the old walled city today you are looking at the walls built later in the cities history, completed in 1541 by the Ottoman ruler Suleiman the Magnificent. You can get a good view of the city by walking these walls.For centuries after these walls were built, they defined the extent of the city of Jerusalem as people were afraid to live outside of the protection of the walls. The new city did not really get started until 1860 and at first people had to be paid to live outside the safety of the walls.The Jaffa GateMost tourists will enter the city on the west side through the Jaffa Gate. Just inside the Jaffa gate to the left is one of the entry places where you can start a walk along the walls.If you have questions the tourism information center is also just inside that entrance. Pick up a free map, because you will need it. If you don’t have a data service download a good offline map like those from maps.me on your smart phone before you leave your hotel or hostel.When I was visiting the city, they were doing a series of free concerts in the evenings and had stages both inside and outside of the Jaffa Gate.The Tower of DavidJust to the left of the Jaffa gate you will see the tower of David, which has nothing to do with King David. Early pilgrims visiting the city read in their bibles that David built a tower and assumed that this must be it, but David’s city is outside the old walls to the south and down the hill from the old city. You can now visit the archaeological site where they are uncovering this city just outside the Dung Gate. You can also visit David’s tomb just outside of the Zion Gate.This tower was first built by Herod the Great who also rebuilt the temple just before the time of Christ. Look at this tower closely and you will see signs of 3 different eras. The base of the tower was built by Herod, the moat around it by the crusaders and the top of the tower by the Malmuks who re-conquered the city from the crusaders.Inside of the tower is an excellent museum, that I highly recommend, that explains the history of this complicated city.Come back to the Tower of David at night to see the light show that is displayed on the battlements for a more colorful artistic version of the history of the city.The Armenian QuarterIf you turn to the right from the Jaffa Gate and come around the Tower of David you can enter the Armenian quarter through the narrow Armenian Patriarchate St. The Armenians were the first country in the world to accept Christianity as a state religion and the Armenian quarter is one of the oldest areas in the Old City. It is also the least populated and the least open to visitors.Follow this street down to St James St (and we are using the term street here very generously). Where these two meet is the Cathedral of St James which has the highest concentration of Saints named James buried here of any place in the world. According to Armenian tradition, the head of St James, son of Zebedee, (brother of John) and the body of St James the Just (brother of Jesus) are both buried in this church. St James the son of Zebedee was the first of the apostles to be martyred and the only one (besides Judas) whose death is mentioned in the bible. This church is opened very limited hours for tourists, only during services.Take St James street until you reach Ararat St and turn left. This street is named after the mountain which was historically in Armenia (and now is just outside their boundaries in Turkey) where the arc of Noah came to rest after the flood. The mountain is sacred to Armenians. If you see a prelate walking down the street wearing a black pointed hat, that would be an Armenian Christian priest and the shape of the hat is to remind you of the mountain of Ararat. Continue down this street until you get to the church of St Mark.Armenian tradition has it that the church of St Mark was built on the site of the upper room where Jesus and his disciples ate the last supper.  Like she many thing sin Israel, there are often more than one site associated with any particular biblical event. Other traditions place the site of the upper room just outside the Zion Gate near the tomb of David.The Roman CardoAfter the church make a quick right on Or HaHayim St. Take a right on Habad St, the first left and the first left again to get onto Ha Yehudim St. This is where your map is going to be very helpful.In the Jewish quarter you can find where archeologists have uncovered the Roman Cardo, or the marketplace from the Roman era. You will have to climb down some steps as the street level of the city today is about one story taller than it was then. Here you will see an artists rendition of a Roman market (with one modern small boy added). You will also find the original paving stones where Jesus and others from that time walked while shopping.The Jewish QuarterThe Jewish quarter has some of the newest construction in the city as much of it was destroyed in the 6 Day War.For religious Jews the most sacred spot in the world is the Temple Mount. Not only is this where Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac (spoiler, it was a test, God stopped him) but they also believe that the stone where God stood to create the world now sits under the Dome of the Rock. For the very religious, even if they were allowed to climb to the top of the Temple Mount, they should not because they might accidentally come into contact with the Holiest of Holies which is where the presents of God dwelled in the temple.The Western Wall is a place where the stones of the Second Temple are exposed and is therefore a sacred site for religious jews. Men pray on the left and women on the right. You can approach the Western Wall but use discretion as this is a very sacred site. You will have to pass through a security checkpoint to reach the Western Wall.On Mondays and Thursdays you will see many young boys celebrating their bar mitzvah. Look for the many torahs near the wall itself.Or look for the jubilant parades of boys, parents, friends, relatives and musicians coming in from the Dung Gate to the right of the Western Wall.The Temple MountThe most photographed building in Jerusalem is probably the Dome of the Rock which has a gilded dome. This building sits on the stop where the Jewish temple was built (and rebuilt). Muslims believe that Mohammad traveled one night from Mecca to the “furthest mosque” or the “most extreme mosque” upon a magical flying beast.This mosque is believed to be the Al-Aqsa Mosque which is the more nondescript large building on the Temple Mount, next to the Dome of the Rock. This mosque is held by most muslims to be the 3rd most holy site after Mecca and Medina.The koran states that Mohammad ascended into heaven from the spot where the Dome of the Rock sits. He then negotiated with God for how often muslims would need to pray during the day. He haggled God down from 50 times a day down to the current 5 times a day, after some prompting from Moses. Haggling skills still come in handy in Jerusalem.Only muslims are allowed to enter either the Dome of the Rock or the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Non-muslims can visit the outside of the buildings but not during times of prayer. One of the best times to come is early in the morning after morning prayer.At the Western Wall you will see a wooden ramp that climbs to the Temple Mount. Exit the secure area of the Western Wall towards the Dung Gate and then queue up to reenter another security check to climb up the ramp. The ramp is also a great place to take pictures of the Western Wall without disturbing those who are praying there.Religious displays for non-Muslims are forbidden on the Temple Mount. Bringing Jewish prayer books, Talit, or Tefilin is forbidden. If you are Jewish, there is a decent chance you will be turned away. Wearing a Kippah will significantly decrease your chances of gaining admission.David StreetYou will exit the Temple Mount from a different gate than you enter, coming out near David street which is a central narrow market street that heads back towards the Jaffa Gate. Take your time bargaining your way along the street if you so desire as the climb back up the hill towards the Christian Quarter.Christian QuarterFollow signs from David street to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. There will be more shops and restaurants along the way and unless you are there very early in the morning, larger groups of pilgrims should be expected.Church of the Holy SepulcherOne of the top churches in Jerusalem to see is the Church of the Holy Sepulcher which is two different holy sites for Christians combined into one. Although it is hard to picture, just up the steps on your right when you enter the church is the rock of Golgotha where Jesus was crucified. You will see pilgrims queue up to touch the spot where the cross stood which is now under an altar. All of this was not just outside of a church but outside of the city walls in the 1st century.Just in front of you as you enter the church is the stone where tradition has it that the body of Jesus was prepared for burial.To the left from the entrance of the church is a tabernacle or building beneath the left of the church’s two domes. Inside this structure is what is left of the cave where, according to tradition, Jesus was buried. It is hard to picture this as a cave these days. The church opens at dawn and the easiest time to see this area without waiting in long lines is to do it early. I was fortunate to enter the church the first time during a service when the building was filled with chanting, singing and organ music from a worship service.The church is in surprising disrepair, although a recent renovation did removed centuries of soot from candles. But still the floor is in need of repair in many places. The church is shared by 5 different denominations of Christians and all must agree to any changes which means in practice that the church is held in a state of status quo.Just to the right and outside of the entrance there are steps that go up to a chapel of the Ethiopian church, which is worth a quick visit.Also continue on up to a courtyard where I found this group of priests.Guided ToursIf you are afraid you will get lost… and you probably will or you want a great tour guide there are a number of good guided tours of the Old City.Take this 4-hour walking tour of old JerusalemUS $36Buy A full day tour that includes underground Jerusalem & the City of David’s archeological excavations.US $89Buy Trace the footsteps of Jesus Christ on a full-day walking tour of Jerusalem, and see the settings of many time-honored biblical tales.US $89Buy ConclusionFrom the church you can either make your way back to the Jaffa Gate or you can continue on into the Christian quarter and Muslim quarter to trace the route of the Via Dolorosa. This is the route that Jesus took to the cross, so it starts near the Lion gate and ends at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.Whatever your faith or lack thereof, Jerusalem is a fascinating place that everyone should visit at least once.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/take-a-road-trip-through-southern-israel/,Road Trip Through Southern Israel,Israel,"When your vacation time is limited and you’re traveling to an exotic location you’ll probably find yourself whizzing from major landmark to the next without smelling the coffee, roses or even the camel droppings! So if you’re in Israel and planning to make the journey south to visit the Dead Sea or Eilat why not be brave and drive there. When you’re traveling independently you get to stop at interesting places along the way and not just go straight from point A to point B. Here are a few places I’ve discovered along the route down south through the Judean and Negev Desert.Ein FawwarEin FawwarEin Fawwar is one of three natural springs that feed into Wadi Kelt northeast of Jerusalem and close to Ma’aleh Adumim. I came across this oasis in the Judean desert which few tourists know about but which many of the locals enjoy, greedily keeping its location a secret. Once you descend the sloping pathway through the dry sand and rocks you’ll see a sudden burst of color as the green foliage comes into view. The natural spring pours into a pool in regular 20-minute spurts and flows down through the reeds and desert grasses forming a narrow brook. You can paddle along the brook or even swim in the naturally formed pool. When we were there we saw stunning dragonflies and a few desert lizards. It was also quite heartwarming to see Jews and Arabs taking refuge from the dry desert heat in the refreshing water in the middle of nowhere.Beware of Camels Near the RoadYotvataYudvata is one of Israel’s leading dairies based on Kibbutz Yotvata 42km north of Eilat. Over the years the kibbutz cafeteria has morphed into a roadway stop complete with a gas station, tourist information center, restaurant, and store.The large store sells fresh homemade products, local arts, and crafts as well as kibbutz dairy products. The two main attractions here are the cows and the ice-cream. OK, so the cows are not real, but there are at least 25 of them lounging around and standing idly watching the visitors. Kids love to climb up on the cows for a photo op. Then there’s the ice-cream, what can I say, simply the best. Especially because you are standing in the middle of the scorching desert.Pundak 101 or Kushi’sThe name of this stop along the Arava Highway comes either from Unit 101, the elite army unit which the owner belonged to or from the stop’s location 101kms from Eilat. Shimon “Kushi” Rimon took to the desert and opened this oasis in 1982 and the place has become a legend. The expansive oasis is constructed out of wood and is covered giving relief from the sun. Not only can you find 24-hour restaurants and restrooms here but also a collection of reptiles, farm animals, arcade games, a camel and a donkey.Genesis LandGenesis LandJourney back to Biblical times with this entertaining and wacky “attraction.” At Genesis Land, you’ll meet a friendly Australian man dressed up as Abraham’s manservant, Eliezer, from the Bible. Eliezer talks to you like you’ve just arrived at his tent 4,000 years ago. Eliezer together with some other Biblical characters entertains the small groups with tales of their life in the desert, a snack of dates and nuts and even a camel ride. Tourists can even dress up in Biblical gear to get into the mood! Then the group gathers around a fire on the edge of a cliff overlooking the expansive Judean Desert and bakes pita bread over the fire. The whole interactive performance takes about an hour and the site also offers a venue for private events, workshops and organized groups.The Dead SeaIt goes without saying that if you are traveling further south you should make a stop at the Dead Sea to float on the water and cover yourself with the mineral rich black mud.Now, if you decide that going it alone is too much of a challenge for you then there are tour companies that travel along this route, although they don’t make all the stops mentioned above. The top three tour companies in Israel are Egged Tours, Dan, and Bein Harim. I’ve taken various tours with each of these companies and I can recommend Bein Harim as being the most personal and the guides very well informed.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/our-travels-travel-to-israel/,Our Travels – Erik Smith Traveled to Israel,Israel,"The Amateur Traveler is the first podcast I ever listened to on a consistent basis, and it is my favorite podcast. I enjoy listening because it allows me to travel to many many places in my head that I would never actually visit. In February 2009, I listened to Amateur Traveler episode #167- Travel to Israel, and the seeds of a journey were sown.The Western Wall on my first dayChris’s guest Douglas, a labor attorney from Cincinnati, talked passionately about his many visits to Israel. Having been raised as a Lutheran, I had long thought of visiting the Holy Land. Douglas talked about bursting into tears the first time he saw the Western Wall, and while less seasoned travelers might have seen this as an overreaction, it gave me goosebumps. I had done a fair amount of international traveling, but very little since 2003, when I began a quest to visit the National Park of the 48 Contiguous United States. Through the course of the next six months, I re-listened to the Israel podcast at least 10 more times. In June, I went out and bought Lonely Planet Israel, and started to look a the practicalities of a trip to Israel.Is Israel Safe?Obviously, security was a major concern of mine, since I would be traveling solo. In the podcast, the guest had gone through lengths to explain how safe he felt in Israel. As much as I trusted his opinion, I needed to be convinced a little more. The more I read and the more people I talked to that had previously visited Israel, the better I felt. By the time I took the actual trip, I was pretty confident about the security situation. Still, one of my biggest surprises on the trip was how safe I felt the whole time.Is Israel Affordable?With the dollar being so low, I was surprised at how affordable Israel was. I had expected it to be on par price-wise with Europe. It was considerably less than Europe, especially in Northern Europe. I didn’t really want to stay in hostels, those days are past me, and I was able to find affordable single rooms at every stop.Road Trip in IsraelMy best travel trip for Israel was a tip I took from the podcast. I never considered traveling around Israel by rental car. I like public transportation and walking, but there were so many areas of Israel I wouldn’t be able to visit via public transport, and that left my options for these areas to guided tours (which can be expensive) or driving (which can be intimidating). Douglas talked about how easy it was to drive in Israel and he was right.He brought up the point that a rental car in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem would be a hindrance, not an asset, and on that he was right. I didn’t drive in Jerusalem (except for picking up the car and immediately heading north toward Galilee), and I spent two frustrating hours navigating the one-way streets in Jaffa, just south of  Tel Aviv. Other than that, driving was easy. I used the company, Eldan,  recommended by Douglas, which I found to be very affordable.My Eldan rental carGolan HeightsThanks to having the rental car, I was able to explore the Golan Heights, the beautiful and disputed tract of land that Israel took from Syria during the Seven Day War of 1967. Nimrod Fortress, one of the highlights during the whole month-long trip was located in the Golan, a few miles from both Syria and Lebanon.Nimrod FortressJerusalemJerusalem was another highlight, especially staying in the Old City. I had looked at many, many options for lodging in Jerusalem. When traveling internationally, I believe getting a comfortable hotel during the first few days of getting used to a new country is important. I settled on the Hotel Hashimi, located right in the middle of the Muslim Quarter, along one of the many pedestrian streets that make up the Muslim Souk (Market).Upon arrival, my sherut (share-taxi) dropped me at the Damascus Gate. Had I not traveled overseas before, the chaos that greeted me inside the gate might have proved crippling due to culture shock. I had to carry all of my bags through the bustling marketplace, but the hotel was worth it. I was greeted by the hotel’s proprietor, Saleh, who became a friend and a fountain of useful information about the city. The rooms were sparse, clean and comfortable. The lobby is an ornate common room I spent quite a bit of leisure time in using the free wifi.Lobby at the Hotel HashimiI had read about the view from the hotel’s third-floor breakfast room. After checking in and dropping my bags in my room, I headed up to it to check out the legendary view. I was not disappointed, as it is spectacular, with sweeping views of the Mount of Olives and the Dome of the Rock.Staying in the Old city may not be for everyone. It is noisy, and the Call to Prayer echos of the walls of the Muslim Quarter a few times a day, including in the middle of the night.The walk from the Damascus Gate I previously mentioned may prove prohibitive for some. There are so many positives, however.I enjoyed strolling the market, especially in the evening after the massive tourist crowds and bus tours have left the city. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was a short walk from my hotel, and I explored it early in the morning and later at night (it opens at 5 am and closes at 9 pm) when the crowds of pilgrims were manageable.View from breakfast room at the Hotel HashimiLocal GuideAnother recommendation I got from the podcast (this one from episode 192- Travel to Jerusalem– with the same guest) was for a guide named Sam, who could be hired for personalized tours. I contacted him to ask about a tour of the West Bank, as I was nervous about trying to visit the Palestinian Territories myself. I knew Bethlehem would be easy enough to do on my own, but the other two sights I really wanted to visit – The Mar Saba Monastery in the Judean Desert and the Tomb of the Patriarchs in the contested town of Hebron- would be tougher to do on my own. The tour turned out to be another of the trip’s highlights.Inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs in HebronMy favorite picture from the trip is one from in front of the Seven Arches Hotel on the Mount of Olives. The view is one of the most remarkable in the work, with the whole Old City of Jerusalem spread out before you. You also get a look at the thousands of graves on the hillside, people buried there believing that they will be amongst the first resurrected and taken to heaven at the end of times.From the Mount of OlivesThe trip was a remarkable experience, one I might never have undertaken had it not been for my love of The Amateur Traveler Podcast. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/acre-israel-history-culture-by-the-sea/,"Acre, Israel – History & Culture by the Sea",Israel,"One of the oldest inhabited cities in Israel, the old walled city of Acre sits on the Northern End of Haifa Bay. Like many other cities in the Holy Land, it has been occupied by many different cultures throughout the centuries. Before it’s heyday during the Crusader and Ottoman periods, it had been occupied by the Persians, Greeks and Romans, just to name a few. Many of those cultures are still visible in Acre’s old walled city, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Excavated Room from the Crusader EraThe city’s most striking building is the Citadel, an Ottoman structure built on the foundations of the old Crusader Fortress. The city was taken in the first crusade, and held for a little less than 100 years. The Knights Templar were busy during this time, building their formidable fortress as well as an elaborate series of subterranean tunnels underneath the city which were to be used in the defense of the city. Today, many of these halls have been excavated, lending an impressive perspective to the building of this complicated structure. An audio guide is available at the visitor’s center which I found very useful in helping me understand how the Citadel was used and defended during the Crusades.The Turkish BathsNear the Citadel is the reconstructed Turkish Bath, restored to what it looked like when it was built in the late 18th Century. These baths were common throughout most of the Ottoman Empire.The Tunnel of the Knights TemplarMuch of the Fortress built by the Knights Templar is now submerged, but thanks to some good excavating and an engineering feat, much of the tunnel they built under the city is now accessible to tourists. This area had been underwater for hundreds of years, but in the mid 1990s a series of pumps was installed and boardwalks were put in place, allowing for a unique glimpse into the defenses that made Acre such a hard city to capture. The tunnels are an easy walk, although the low ceilings in many places might make for some uncomfortable walking while crouched over for those visitor’s over six feet tall.The Walls of AcreThe underground tunnels were only one of the factors that made Acre a difficult city to capture. Being a walled city surrounded by water on three sides also made it hard for invaders to properly attack the city. Nowhere in Acre is that more apparent than the walls on the Mediterranean side of the city. Much of the defense wall remains in place today, and a stroll around those ramparts is truly eye-opening. There are also sweeping views over the Mediterranean Sea and across the Bay of Haifa.Fresh Bread in the Acre SouqAs historically significant as Acre is, my favorite part of the city was it’s bustling souq, or market. The souq is such a colorful place, with an almost unimaginable abundance of goods for sale. I especially enjoyed seeing the fresh seafood displays, something unique to the markets in the coastal cities.Spices for sale in the souqThe Morning’s Catch fresh from the MediterraneanAcre is an easy day-trip from Haifa, less than an hour away from Haifa across the bay. Acre also has one of the largest Arab populations (nearly 28%) of any Israeli city outside the West Bank. This gives the city a feel to it that is especially unique amongst Israel’s coastal cities. That adds a cultural reason to the historical ones for including Acre on any itinerary in Israel.Share this: "

Coming across these things mentally ease your trek and push you a little forward every time.On the way to NongriatAfter a 1.5 to 2 hours climb, you reach the Nongriat village. Though this trek could be done in a day, I would suggest spending the rest of the day in the village and then continue with exploring the nearby attractions the next day. It’s also a more economical & peaceful stay option as compared to commercial ones in Shillong.The next day, you could start off with trekking to the Rainbow Falls, which a 1 to 2 hours trek from the Nongriat village. On the way, you also get to see the Double Decker Root Bridge, which is one of the most popular destinations in Meghalaya. The Living Root bridges were made by intertwining the roots of two trees to make a bridge.Double Root Bridges, NongriatAfter a refreshing swim in the falls, the hardest part of the trek begins. Climbing up 3500 steps again to reach the Tryna village! After the trek, I frowned at the sight of steps for a month but if given a chance, I would be here again.The Nongriat trek is not the easiest one and does test your endurance, but it doesn’t disappoint.Reaching thereFrom Shillong, you’d first have to reach Cherapunjee by shared cabs or buses (they are available in plenty). From Cherapunjee, hire a cab/shared cab to Tryna village, from where you can begin your trek.Distance & Time TakenTryna to Nongriat to Rainbow Falls & back – 18kms, spans around 5.5 to 6 hours.Difficulty LevelHardBest time to visitMarch or November. Make sure to definitely NOT visit in the monsoons, as the steps get slippery.Things to know before the trekBe prepared for the steps. Take some practice beforehand if needed.Be prepared for the rains. Regardless of if you are visiting in the monsoons are not. Because Cherrapunji is one of the wettest places, and the rains can make the steps slippery. Go with proper trekking gear and water protection for your electronics and valuables.Carry a change of clothes/swimming gear if jumping into waterfalls on the first sight, sounds like you.Goechala Trek, SikkimMt Kanchenjunga is the third tallest mountain in the world, and that’s what you get to feast in the Goechala Trek.Yuksom is the base camp of Goecha La pass trek. You begin the multi-day trek from here to your first stop – Prek, Sachen. On the way from Yuksom to Sachen, amidst the staggering beauty of the mountains that surround you, you pass through two bridges – Pha Khola and Tshushay Khola.The next destination is Bakhim, which is an hour away from the Prek, which also has lodging options.

The first views of the snow-clad peaks of Kanchenjunga from your campsite at Tshoka are mesmerizing and take your breath away!After settling in your camp, you could take some time exploring the Buddhist monastery at Tshoka, try out the malt beer – Tumba in the cafes or interact with the Tibetian families residing there.As you trek your way from Tshoka to Dzongri through Phedang, you are accompanied by inexplicable views and pretty wooden benches all through the way. When you reach the top of Dzongri, you feel peace… a top of the world feeling as you set your eyes upon the Kanchenjunga. It’s where you get a 180-degree panoramic view of the Kanchenjunga range.But the best is yet to come – the sunrise. You camp there at the Dzongri campsite and wait until the sun dawns the next day. The first rays of sunlight on the peaks of Kanchenjunga are nothing less than a magical sight to witness, and this was it, for the Goechala trek for me.View of the Kanchenjunga Peaks from Dzongri campsiteWatching the mountains glow with different colors of the sunrise, I couldn’t help but bow down to the mighty mountains.Reaching thereThe New Jalpaiguri Railway station is the closest to the Yuksom base camp.

If you take up this trek in the winter, the entire trek route is covered with snow. The Sandakphu trek is not only about the final view that you set your eyes upon, but the beauty you find all the way till you reach the summit.Rhododendrons in full bloomThe final leg of the trek is from Sandakphu to Phalut through Sabargram, from where you get the best panoramic views of the mountains and peaks. From the Phalut, you get to view Mt. Kanchenjunga (3rd highest peak), Mt. Everest (highest peak), Lhotse (4th highest peak) and Makalu (5th highest peak).

The entire trek route is well paved, is safe and can be done independently.The trail starts at Umkynrut-Kynjat Phutbol in Lumparing, and most of the trek is through a paved path in the dense forests. While focussing on the next step is often the most important thing in a trek, take some definitive breaks in between to enjoy the exemplary views, which are unseen on a misty day. On a clear day, the lovely views of pretty waterfalls and lush green mountains overlooking you, are just fabulous.A rather short trek of around 45 minutes to 1 hour takes you to the Shillong Peak, and you see Shillong at its best from there. It was raw, untouched, unspoiled beauty of nature that we hope remains the same forever.View along the Shillong Peak TrekAfter treating yourself to some freshly roasted corn, and spending some time visiting the sacred site of the local deity of Shillong ( U Shulong), you can make your way down the same route to Lumparing.Reaching thereFrom Shillong, you can take a cab to Lumparing and then begin the trek from there.Distance & Time TakenLumparing to Shillong Peak: 5.5kms one way, 45 minutes to 1 hour.Best time to visitSeptember to MayThings to know before the trekCameras are not allowed in the Shillong Peak trek for security reasons, and you would have to surrender them before the trek.Carrying packed lunch or snacks is a must because there aren’t many eateries on the route.I hope you have a great time trekking these peaks in North Eastern India.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/historic-places-in-delhi/,Historic Places in Delhi,India,"Delhi, the vibrant capital of India, is a city steeped in history and culture, yet overflowing with modernity and the never-ceasing rhythm of life. The beautifully chaotic city has plenty around every corner; whether it is exploring the frantic street bazaars, riding an auto rickshaw or savoring the tantalizing dishes of the country, Delhi is an experience that lingers on your mind long after you have returned.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the city is the sheer range of historic sights. With centuries-old temples, tombs and other ruins scattered throughout the city, one could spend weeks discovering the vivid past of Delhi and ancient India. The city was ruled by numerous empires and dynasties throughout history – who left behind fascinating relics that show you a glimpse of classical India.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Gupta EmpireThe Iron Pillar of DelhiDelhi SultanateQutub ComplexQutub MinarLodi GardensSur EmpireIsa Khan Niyazi’s Garden Tomb Purana Qila FortMughal EmpireMughal Emperor Humayun’s TombThe Red FortJama Masjid MosqueBritish RajIndia GateNational MuseumFor fellow history buffs, here are some of the most noteworthy historic places in Delhi that you should note down on your itinerary. The sites are listed in chronological order and grouped by who was ruling Delhi at the time they were built.Gupta EmpireFounded by Maharaja Sri Gupta, the ancient Gupta Empire ruled Delhi and much of Northern India from sometime in the 200s until 590. While the Gupta Empire expanded its territory through war, the empire’s reign ushered in a period of peace and great strides were made in the fields of arts, architecture, science, literature, and religion. The growth and success continued for two and a half centuries and historians commonly refer to the period as the “Golden Age” in the country’s history.The Iron Pillar of DelhiThe iron pillar of Delhi is inside the Qutub Complex and the entrance fee is combined. Its plain appearance belies its historic significance. The fact that it was created more than 1500 years ago and has not rusted away, although its located in the open air, demonstrates the sophistication of the art of ironworking and engineering at the time it was created.It has remained an object of fascination for archaeologists and metallurgists. The Iron Pillar rises to 24 feet and weighs six tons because of the 98% wrought iron composition. The base and the top of the Iron Pillar features intricate carvings while Sanskrit inscriptions cover the rest of it.Entrance Fee: 10 Rupees – Indians | 250 Rupees – Foreign TouristsHours: 6 AM to 6 PM, Sunday to SaturdayDelhi SultanateThe Delhi Sultanate ruled Delhi and North India for three centuries, starting from the thirteenth century. Over the course of its reign, the Sultanate was ruled by 5 dynasties.Qutb al-Din Aibak, a Turkic slave general,  founded the first dynasty which was the Mamluk Dynasty. They ruled Delhi during the period of 1150 – 1210.Jalal ud din Firuz Khalji founded the Khalji dynasty which ruled from 1290 till 1320. The Khalji successfully fought off a Mongol invasion.Ghazi Malik, who was Tukro-Indian, started the Tughlaq dynasty which ruled Delhi from 1320 – 1413. The Delhi Sultanate ruled much of what is now modern India in this period.Khizr Khan founded the Sayyid dynasty which ruled from 1414 till 1451. Rulers in this dynasty claimed to be descendants of the prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima.Bahlul Khan Lodi founded the Lodi dynasty which ruled Delhi from 1451 – 1526.When the last Sultan of the Lodi Dynasty died during a war, the Delhi Sultanate collapsed.Qutub ComplexLocated in the oldest inhabited region in Delhi, the Qutub Complex is home to a number of noteworthy historic sites. The second most visited attraction in India, it was built by the Turks, who heralded in the Sultanate Rule. It offers one of the best glimpses into early Sultanate architecture and history.The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque and the Qutub Minar – a UNESCO World Heritage Site – remain the highlights of the Complex but monuments like Alai Gate, Alai Minar, and the many Jain temples and tombs of rulers are all spots that are sure to intrigue history lovers.Entrance Fee: 30 Rupees – Indians | 500 Rupees – Foreign TouristsHours: 7 AM to 5 PM, Sunday to SaturdayQutub MinarOne of the greatest architectural marvels to come out of the thirteenth century, the Qutub Minar is a brilliant example of India’s architectural might. Standing at 72m (239.5 feet), it is the tallest brick minaret in the world and was built to mark the Turk’s victory against the Chauhan Dynasty. Construction was started on the tower in 1192 by the founder of the Delhi Sultanate Qutab-Ud-Din-Aibak.The architectural style used is of particular interest as it sparked the beginning of the fusion of Indian and West Asian architectural styles. The structure was built predominantly using red sandstone, which explains the red hue on the building’s surface.The first floor of the tower features complex floral carvings which blend together with carvings of Quran verses while exquisitely carved stone brackets top off a mesmerizing fusion of Indian and Islamic styles. Visitors are allowed to reach the top, but they will need to scale a 379 step staircase to get there. Entrance Fee: 30 Rupees – Indians | 500 Rupees – Foreign TouristsHours: 7 AM to 5 PM, Sunday to SaturdayTomb of Shish Gumbad – Lodi GardensLodi GardensLodi GardensFor those looking for a bit of peace and quiet from Delhi’s bustling streets, the calming green oasis that is Lodi Gardens is a great spot to be at. The array of fountains, ponds, artificial streams, and well-manicured lawns and shrubs are sure to soothe even the most flustered souls. The gardens are also dotted with fifteenth-century relics including tombs, mosques, bridges and wartime structures like watchtowers that add to the mystic and otherworldly appeal of the park.These beautiful gardens hold tombs including:Tomb of Mohammed Shah – Sayyid dynasty – built 1444Tomb of Sikandar Lodi – Lodi Dynasty – reigned 1489–1517Tomb of Bara Gumbad – Lodi Dynasty – built 1490Tomb of Shish Gumbad – Lodi Dynasty – built sometime between 1489 and 1517Entrance Fee: FreeHours: 6 AM to 7.30 PM, Sunday to SaturdaySur EmpireThe Mughal Empire started before the Sur Empire, which was short lived, but I am listing the Sur Empire first because all the Delhi Mughal sites are from the time period after the Sur Empire.After Babar, the first Mughal emperor, conquered much of India his son Humayun would lose much of it including Delhi to the short lived Sur Empire. Sher Shah Suri defeated Humayun to take over the entire Mughal Empire. The reign of the Sur Empire was short-lived. It lasted for only 16 years, from 1540-1555. Historians note that the empire saw a significant uptick in the economy and Sher Shah Suri brought about many reforms to minimize corruption and public oppression.Humayun would soon take Delhi back, but Sher Shah Suri’s brilliance and the Sur Empire provide a short interlude and add to Delhi’s growing cultural sights.Isa Khan Niyazi’s Garden Tomb This is the garden tomb of a Pashtun noble of the Sur Empire. The tomb was one of the first examples of a sunken garden design that would later be used for the construction of the Taj Mahal.Other than the octagonal tomb, the walled complex consists of a mosque built in Sur styled architecture. According to inscriptions on the tomb, the complex was built between A.D. 1547-1548.Isa Khan Niyazi’s Garden Tomb is part of the complex of Mughal Emperor Humayun’s Tomb and is combined in the entrance fee for that site. It is the first structure as you enter the heritage site.Entrance Fee: 30 Rupees – Indians | 500 Rupees – Foreign TouristsHours: 6 AM to 6 PM, Sunday to SaturdayPurana Qila FortA sixteenth century stone fort, Purana Qila Fort has played a key role throughout India’s history. Soaked in history, the area around the fort has been inhabited since 300 BC. It was first built by Mughal emperor Humayun and then completed by Sher Shah Suri after he deposed the former. The fort contains a step well, a library – where Mughal emperor Humayun tripped down and died after taking back control of Delhi – and a Sur architecture styled mosque that served as Sher Shah Suri’s private mosque. Oh, and if all that does not seem intriguing enough, Mughal chronicles claim that the fort sits on the site of Indraprastha – the capital of the Pandavas – a story that sits in between myth and reality.Today, the fort is the site for a beautiful sound and light show that takes place every evening (other than Friday) from 7 PM to 8 PM for the Hindi version and 8.30PM to 9.30PM for the English version.Entrance Fee: 20 Rupees – Indians | 200 Rupees – Foreign Tourists | 25 for CamcordersHours: 7 AM to 5 PM, Tuesday to SundayMughal EmpireThe present is not the only time that Delhi has been the capital city. In 1526 India was invaded by the Mughals. The first of the Mughal Emperors was Babur who was born in what is now modern Uzbekistan. He was a descendant of Emperor Timur (Tamerlane) who had conquered Persia in the late 1300s. The Mughals captured most of what is now Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh and would rule much of the population of India until 1740. At the height of their strength, the Mughal Empire was considered one of the greatest empires on Earth.Humayan, Babur’s son, lost control of the empire in 1540 to the Sur Empire lead by Sher Shah Suri. However, by 1555 he managed to take back control of Delhi. Shortly afterward, his son Akbar ascended the throne and hence began the “classic period” of the Mughal Empire.Akbar, who is regarded as one of the greatest rulers of India, took over the throne when he was 13 and eventually expanded his empire to the North, West and the central parts of the country. He was widely recognized for his belief in religious tolerance. He appointed many Hindus to high positions and constantly worked to win over the Hindu population in the country.Very much interested in art and learning, rulers of the Mughal empire frequently sponsored such projects, leaving behind a goldmine of paintings, literature and historic structures like the Taj Mahal.Mughal Emperor Humayun’s TombThis UNESCO World Heritage Site was constructed in 1570 and holds a special significance due to the fact that it was the first garden tomb in South Asia. It served as inspiration for many other structures reaching its zenith at the Taj Mahal. But while the interior of the Taj Mahal is dark, the interior of Humayun’s tomb is light and airy with his very simple white marble sarcophagus in the center under the dome.Commissioned by Humayun’s son, the tomb was built with red sandstone in the form of an octagon and topped off with a 42.5m high marble dome.Other members of Humayun’s family are buried in the complex as well as other later emperors including Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi Ul-Darjat, Rafi Ud-Daulat, Muhammad Kam Bakhsh, and Alamgir II.Entrance Fee: 30 Rupees – Indians | 500 Rupees – Foreign TouristsHours: 6 AM to 6 PM, Sunday to SaturdayThe Red FortOnce the palace of the Mughal rulers, the Red Fort was the empire’s capital for two centuries. Named after the red sandstone used to build the fort, the palace features opulent marble sculptures, beautiful gardens, museums and decorations that included the Kohinoor diamond. It is widely considered the pinnacle of Mughal architecture and is even used today for important government occasions – the Prime Minister of India gives his Independence Day speech at the Lahore Gate of the palace.Other than the fusion of Mughal and Persian architectural styles, a visit to Delhi’s Red Fort is an excellent way to learn about the day to day life of the ancient rulers who shaped the course of India.Protip; The area surrounding the Red Fort includes multiple shopping areas and makes for an interesting visit.Entrance Fee: 35 Rupees – Indians | 500 Rupees – Foreign Tourists | 25 for CamcordersHours: 9.30 AM to 4.30 PM, Tuesday to SundayJama Masjid MosqueThe Jama Masjid Mosque can be found in Old Delhi. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (who also built the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort) between 1644 and 1656. The original name of the mosque, Masjid-i-Jahan Numa, meant “mosque commanding view of the world”.This mosque is one of the largest mosques in all of India. You are welcome to visit the mosque even if you are not a muslim although tourists are not allowed during prayer hours. The structure is not all that deep but the large courtyard can hold as many as 25,000 worshipers. Tourist who need appropriate dress can rent a covering at the northern gate.Entrance Fee: Free | 300 Rupees for PhotographyHours: 7am to Noon, 1.30pm to 6.30pm, Everyday, British RajThe British had a presence on the Indian Subcontinent from the middle of the 1700s and ruled India from 1858 to 1947.While they had been trading with India for a long time, the British did not start seizing land until 1757, after the Battle of Plassey.After a rebellion led by the Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah was crushed, the British tightened their grip by exiling the emperor and bringing an end to the Mughal Empire and introducing harsher laws.India’s independence movement began around the time of World War II and the struggle ended with India declaring Independence on August 15th, 1947.While the period was tumultuous, there are several sites that should interest history fans.India GateOfficially called the Delhi Memorial, this sandstone arch was built as a monument to the Indian troops who died in the wars between 1914-1919. The arch is situated towards the East of Rajpath and stands at a height of 42 meters (138ft).Designed by architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, the monument is similar to the Arc de Triomphe in France. The names of the thirteen thousand soldiers who fell at war are inscribed on the Gate.Entrance Fee: NoneHours: Open 24/7National MuseumThe National Museum dates to the time of the Raj – established in 1949 but has a collection that spans all the history of India. The collection is a bit heavy on the statues of Hindu gods as you might expect.One of the largest museums in the country, visitors can discover around two hundred thousand artifacts, both local and from across the world. The artifacts range from prehistoric relics to artifacts from the times of the Buddha to modern day paintings and the like.For those who want to trace India’s rich and often turbulent history from the Bronze Age to global superpower, the National Museum of India is a highly recommended choice.Entrance Fee: 10 Rupees – Indians | 300 Rupees – Foreign Tourists | 25 for CamcordersHours: 10 AM to 6 PM, Tuesday to SundayI visited Delhi with a group of Amateur Traveler listeners run by Intrepid Travel.

https://amateurtraveler.com/volunteering-in-india/,Volunteering in India – Sustainable Tourism,India,"India, as it may seem on the internet and travel magazines, to be a diverse and multi-cultural nation with more than 22 major languages spoken, 13 different scripts written and with over 720 dialects – this will churn up to your mind as the perfect destination to be visited on your next holiday. Ranging from the majestic Himalayas in the North to the serene backwaters in the South, from the barren Thar desert in the West to the picturesque seven sister states in the East – this would only suffice your decision to plan your itinerary on the go.But there still lies a concern and you to review your decision. No! We are not discouraging you to change your mind about visiting this beautiful country but to re-think the purpose of coming to India.Problems India is still fighting againstEducation LevelEven today, India has a literacy rate of a mere 74% with a chunk of its population still striving to gain basic education. Several government initiatives running over decades, many social service-groups and other private organizations have stepped forward to help in this noble cause. Despite all these efforts, the nation is still striving towards educating every poor child and making them sound in necessary languages.      2.  Women In-equalityA country that took leaps in countless fields like arts, science, technology, and literature still does not stand for gender equality in every aspect. According to a report by the United Nation Development Programme, India has a mere share of 11.6% of its administrative body as women and a whopping 100 Maternal Mortality Rate. Messages and campaigns addressing this agenda have been countless in number across social media platforms, school syllabi, and national debates but the nation is still fighting its odds.     3.  Medical AwarenessWHO has ranked India as 112th in terms of medical awareness and the state of medical infrastructure across the country among 191 countries worldwide. Even after 70 years of its independence India still is fighting against mismanagement of health services. Some major factors being:Neglect of Rural PopulationEmphasis on Culture MethodInadequate Outlay for HealthSocial InequalityShortage of Medical PersonnelMedical ResearchExpensive Health Service     4.  Increasing number of OrphanagesOrphans and the other vulnerable children and adolescents (OVCA) living in institutional homes are more prone to behavioral and emotional problems than others as they are deprived of a family’s love and care. There is a dearth of studies focusing on the psychological health of these children in India. Today India is home to 20 million orphans and are falling short in terms of resources to provide all the necessary time and care required for a child.     5.  Pollution StandardsWith drastic urbanization and increasing population in the metro cities in India, pollution turned out to be the major concern of the nation. 11 cities to be featured among the top 15 worldwide as the most polluted cities, this still is a nightmare India is curbing against. Improper sewage, use of harmful vehicle gases, plastics and factory emissions on top of everything have not helped the cause in any manner. The famous monuments and heritage artworks need to be restored and maintained – they being invaluable possession of the nation.How can you help as a tourist Cometh the hour, cometh the concept! In today’s world of increasing problems, it is our responsibility as global citizens to eradicate all odds and make the world a better place to live on. We as responsible travelers can opt for several Volunteering Programs and bring about a change in society. This would no way engage you full time in working towards a social cause but also allow you ample time to see around and explore the gems of this country the way you like.The benefits YOU would gain out of itSelf-satisfactionWhat better feeling can one draw other than helping a number of people and contributing to the betterment of a community. Spreading happiness around has no replacement and can only reward you with joy and satisfaction. Some organizations top it up by certifying you just to take part and do the job you love to.    2.  Get up-close with locals Stay with locals, eat with locals and explore around with locals – what better mode of travel can you possibly think of? Must-visit attractions, the best mode of transport, local homemade food – your ideal holiday in the making.     3.  Cost-effectiveWith the majority of your travel needs taken care of, you will end up spending just a quarter of your budget that you had in mind before coming on your vacation. No luxury hotels, no fancy restaurants nor any professional guide – all these things being your hidden benefits once you opt for these programs.    4.  Expand your Social CircleThis gives you an opportunity to meet mentors, network with people and expand their social circle beyond limits. It brings like-minded people together and forges lifelong friendships. Working alongside people who feel strongly about supporting a particular cause creates a path to developing strong relationships with others. Interacting with people outside your normal social circles gives you the opportunity to expand your connections and build networking skills.    5.  Physical and Mental BenefitA task like volunteering calls for a lot of dedication and hard work. Whether it is for handling a class od 20 odd kids or attending patients in a village clinic, it keeps your mind and body on yoes all the time. This allows you not only to stay physically fit but also improves your mental strength.    6.  Boost your CareerWorking with the resident doctors, being a physio/coach for a sports team, teaching basic computer skills to women from rural areas and many more such activities; all these add a good amount of experience and exposure to your resume and push it a notch up.    7.  Be an Inspiration to othersInspiration is like a ripple effect. It just passes on to a like-minded person without you having to take any extra effort. Imagine going for a volunteering program with your entire family; imagine your kids watching you helping others. What better way could possibly be of imparting social education to your children.    8.  Contribute towards ‘Sustainable Development’In a Society for Human Resources Management study, companies with strong sustainability programs were compared to companies with poor programs. The former had 55% better morale, 43% more efficient businesses processes, 43% stronger public image, and 38% better employee loyalty (CNN, 2012). Sustainable Development, although, apparently is more of a ‘social’ than a ‘professional’ thing but even tad bit of farsightedness will dictate we develop, albeit, sustainably, for the very survival of the generations ahead.So to draw it short, it’s of course fun traveling around, but what more satisfaction can you draw out of it rather than working towards a social cause for the destination. Your dream picture in front of Taj Mahal and your visit to Hawa Mahal in Jaipur might be among the top things to do list, couple with it a 1-week volunteer program educating orphans or helping out patients in a rural section around Delhi – your perfect holiday to India is just a plan away!Share this: "

Over the course of the trip we spent the night in:modest hotels in Delhi, Agra and Jaipura more fancy hotel in Varanasia heritage accommodation that belonged to a local ruler in Tordi Garhtwo night trains to and from VaranasiDelhiAir qualityWe traveled to India in the dry season in November which was great for weather but not the best for air quality when we were in Delhi. The smog was particularly bad when we were there. It got so bad that United airlines stopped flying to Delhi for a time between our arrival and departure fearing crew health issues. As I understand it the air quality is a combination of the cars, industry and the burning off of local fields.TrafficOne of the most notable aspects of Delhi is traffic. The traffic is a mix of cars, motorbikes and the ubiquitous tuk-tuks. Yes, sometimes you need to close your eyes because of some maneuver by your tuk-tuk driver, but much more often you want o close your ears because of the incessant honking of horns. As far as I can tell, an Indian vehicle will cease to function if you stop honking its horn. On the way in the from the airport I tried to count to see what was the longest period of time that I could count between hearing car horns. I once made it to 6 seconds. But if your travel insurance is paid up and your relationship with your maker is on good terms, then there is nothing else to do but sit back, clothes your eyes as needed and enjoy the spectacle.FoodMy whole group loved the food in India. We ate at hotels. We went around the corner to local restaurants. We even stopped by stands along the highway for street food. None of us got sick, although some of us were nervous we would. I never did use the steri-pen I brought.I did find the food often to be spicy. Now don’t get me wrong, I like spicy, but India got a bit too spicy for me at times… depending on what I ordered. My go to dish is chicken biryani. I had it on the Air India flight I took over and was surprised that airline food could reach my tolerance for spicy. Given that food tastes more bland at altitude, that is impressive. When I arrived at Delhi I went around the corner to the first whole in the wall restaurant I found and that was the only chicken biryani on the trip that I could not finish because of the amount of spice. Other things that we ordered were fine and people who did not like spicy food, did also enjoy the food.Exploring DehliBefore and after the tour we took 2-3 days to explore the city on our own. Some of the sites I hit were:Mughal Emperor Humayun’s TombIsa Khan Niyazi’s Garden TombLodi GardensQutub MinarIndia GateThe National MuseumRead more at Historic Places in DelhiOld DelhiOur first sightseeing as part of the tour was a visit to Old Delhi. I may have thought Delhi was chaotic but Old Delhi turns that up to 11. It is a wonderful concoction of street carts, monkeys climbing the tangle of telephone wires, shops and food stalls.Jama Masjid MosqueWe visited the large Jama Masjid mosque, one of the largest in India. They expect tourists so all the ladies are rented a covering garment. Conservative dress is appropriate and you cannot wear your shoes inside. When I say “inside”, I mean inside the complex as the mosque itself is a shallow building with most of the actual worship taking place outside.It was not advised for women to climb the minaret unless accompanied by a man, lest they get harassed. I am not sure any of our group made the climb.Sikh Temple – Gurdwara Sis Ganj Sahib jiWe visited the Sikh Temple which was quite a different experience. It was bright and colorful and musical. The temple dates back to 1783 and was built on the site where the 9th Sikh guru was killed.One of the more memorable parts of our visit to the temple was a visit to the large kitchens where the community, with help from members of our group, cooked food for any who want it. We stayed for a simple meal of bread and lentils.We spent some time shoppin the wonderfully colorful streets of Old Delhi. Our guide Pancham, who we loved by this early point in the trip, had worked on cruise ships and as a chef in restaurants so he was a great resource to talk about Indian food for the whole trip. In a spice shop he introduced us to the basic spices in Indian cuisine: curry, coriander and turmeric.We shopped for some snacks for the next leg of our journey which would be the night train to Varanasi.Night Train to VaranasiI have written in some depth about Riding the Night Train in India so let me just say here that the experience was interesting.  Think of a dorm room at a hostel with 60 or so people except that it is in motion. The chai vendor will come around periodically and sell you a warm cup of chai and we were quite addicted to it even this early in the trip.I had previously ridden the night train in China on another Intrepid tour (see Riding the Night Train in China – with Video). That trip should have been 1st class but we had been bumped to 2nd class because we were traveling close to Golden Week. The Indian 2nd class car was better. In particular the toilets were kept more clean. Also the system for figuring out which car you were in was very clear and very organized on these tremendously long trains.Varanasi is quite far from Delhi and the rest of the places that we visited. You could certainly avoid this train trip but Varanasi was the highlight of the trip for everyone in the group as I recall, so I was glad we had done the itinerary that included it.VaranasiI have written in depth about Varanasi as it was the most memorable part of our trip (Varanasi, India – Ceremony, Tourism and Death on the Ganges – Video #103), so I will just hit the highlights here.Varanasi was overwhelming. This is a hindu holy city on the banks of the Ganges River. There are a series of 88 ghats, or wide flights of stairs, that lead down to the river. Here people would be bathing in the waters of the river. In two of these ghats bodies were brought for cremation in a much more public way than we would be comfortable with back at home.Sunrise Boat RideMy favorite part of the trip was the boat ride that started just after the sunrise prayer ceremony. We got into one of the many colorful boats in the smoky misty light of dawn and cruised down the length of the city watching the scenery that seemed almost a ubiquitous beige color interrupted by the colorful saris of the women and the brightly painted boats.I took so many pictures in such a short period of time that I burned through an entire battery on my camera. You are going to want a camera with a good zoom that can take pictures like this from a moving boat from a distance.We even went past one ghat where a Bollywood film was being made.Hindu CeremoniesWe went down to the river at dawn and again at dusk to see the Hindu daily prayer ceremonies that involved sets of priests with smoke and chanting and fire making a series of ritual motions akin to dance. All this is going on as throngs of tourists watch. At the evening ceremony we got back in a boat and watched from a tourist flotilla as young chai vendors hopped from boat to boat plying their wares.We had our own more private chance to send prayers out on the Ganges with small biodegradable floating candles.We also went shopping, drank lassis, watched funerals, dodged sacred cows, rode on tuk-tuks and pedicabs and visited a run-down fort. Check out my Varanasi post for more details.Agra – Taj MahalI’ll bet you thought the highlight of this article and of this trip would be the Taj Mahal. I probably did as well.We arrived into Agra much later than planned as I explain in the India Night Train article. Because of this we did not have a chance to visit the Red Fort. But the main reason that you go to Agra, if not India, is to visit this white marble mausoleum on the banks of the Yamuna river which was built to honor the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan’s favorite wife. I think it is the story as well as the beauty of the building that makes the Taj Mahal as well known.Let me be clear, just because the Taj Mahal was not the highlight of my trip doesn’t mean that this visit let me down in any way. The Taj Mahal is beautiful and worth seeing and the crowds there should not deter you from visiting. We visited in late afternoon and then stayed to see it in the fading light of dusk when it takes on a pink hue.In my opinion, the beauty of the building is the exterior. If you are deterred from visiting the dark interior by the crowds you aren’t missing much.Tordi GarhI met some listeners of the Amateur Traveler because of Tordi Garh. I was in Key West in the summer after our trip and I was wearing my tour t-shirt with this list of places we went on the back: Delhi, Varanasi, Agra, Tordi Garh, Jaipur. I realized a couple at the next table were staring at me. No, they had not recognized me… yet… they just wanted to know where the heck is “Tordi Garh”.Tordi Garh is not a major city in India but a village of about 5,000 people. Visiting it was an intentional effort to get us out of the cities into the countryside. We stayed in a Heritage-listed palace owned by the descendants of the person who used to run if not own this village.It was a nice chance to see what life is like in the countryside. We visited a step well, had a tour through the different streets of the town. Segregation by cast is no longer legal in India, but still a fact of life in these villages.We climbed the hill above town at sunrise to the ruins of an old Mugul fortress with a view of the area.JaipurThe last city that we visited was Jaipur the capital of Rajasthan. Jaipur is known as the Pink City because of the color of its buildings.Amer FortOutside of town the group visited the massive Amer Fort. This spectacular fortified palace takes up 4 square kilometers on the top of a hill. This fort gives a very clear signal who has the power in town. It must be good to be the Raja.The outside is foreboding and the inside of the fort is opulent with gardens, fountains, and halls where you could hold court. It has everything a self-respecting ruler would need.Hawa Mahal – “Palace of Winds”The most spectacular of the buildings downtown was the Palace of Winds which sits at the edge of the city palace.Jantar MantarJantar Mantar is a collection of nineteen 18th century astronomical instruments including the world’s largest sundial. Great effort was put into tracking the sun and celestial bodies not for scientific reasons but for astrological reasons. We were told that even today you would not start a company or hold a marriage on a day that was inauspicious. We visited Jantar Mantar and Hawa Mahal  on our free time. Intrepid trips do have free time for you to explore on your own or maybe line up a cooking class or some other day tour through Urban Adventures which is affiliated with Intrepid.Also on our free time Pancham took a group of us to a Bollywood movie. It was not what I expected. It was a romantic comedy, not a musical, with the same production quality as Hollywood… although in hindi. The movie theatre was beautiful but… people don’t apparently have the habit of being quiet through movies.DelhiThe tour ended as it started at the same hotel in Delhi.ConclusionI have taken Intrepid tours now to China, Morocco, Cambodia and India and each time the guide has been a treasure. Pancham was a great resource for trying to understand India a bit better. He would herd us to some of his favorite restaurants or stop the bus out in the countryside because he saw a vendor selling water chestnuts or homemade fritters that he thought we should try. He was patient and always cheerful.The  “Indian Getaway” tour from Intrepid is a great first experience with India. It left me wanting to go back as it did many of our group. You don’t have to take my word for it as you can hear their reactions on Amateur Traveler India Trip – Amateur Traveler Podcast Episode 590Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/kerala/,14 Best Places to Visit in Kerala and What to Do There – India,India,"Since just living is not enough, one must have sunshine, freedom and a little flower! Add to this list a few quaint sea towns, misty coffee plantations on gently sloping hill terraces, languid backwaters, and soul food, and you have a perfect reason to visit God’s own country Kerala one fine winter. For me, Kerala happened at the end of a tedious semester when I couldn’t take another day at the campus anymore. It was time to throw off the bowlines and sail far far away from familiar harbors.Kerala tantalizes with typical backpacking goals, of trekking around the Nilgiris, stopping at hip hostels, yoga, and surf on the beach, photo-ops amid wilderness, touring spice gardens and coffee plantations, recharging body, and spirits with Ayurveda– what a never-ending wonder list! The rich cultural landscape and the spiritual heritage of the province was yet another incentive to explore. Here are 14 of the best places in Kerala and what to do there:1. Trivandrum/ Thiruvananthapuram A noisy, chaotic, and industrially overloaded vibe usually dominates old state capitals of India, but not Trivandrum. The city spreads over seven hills, has ample greenery and is quaintly urban. There were a handful of museums, a heritage zoo, a little tourist village, beautiful churches, and other architectural and historical attractions on my list of places to visit in Trivandrum, but I was longing to meet the sea first. My first memory of rendezvousing with the ocean was made at Shanghumukham Beach. The beach is just a stone’s throw away from the airport and has a fascinating mermaid sculpture, showcasing the artistry of local sculpture Kanai Kunjiraman. The charming Take-A-Break restaurant on the beach and the classic Old Coffee House here are warm and welcoming.My Takeaways: Tasting ‘Kesari Halwa’ at Coffee House, day-tripping at Neyyar Wildlife Sanctuary, a tour of Napier Museum, Museum of Natural History and SMSM Institute, sublime afternoons at Valiyathura Pier and Vizhinjam Lighthouse.2. KozhikodeThe cultural plurality of Kozhikode is fascinating with a number of temples, mosques, and churches around the city. Beautiful wide beaches, the Dolphin’s Point, Tali Temple, and Thusharagiri Waterfalls made it on my list of places to visit from local recommendations. The town has a legacy of the Portuguese coming to India during the Age of Discovery. In Kozhikode, at Kappad Beach, the great maritime explorer Vasco Da Gama set foot on May 27, 1498, as a plaque on a commemorative monument reads. My Takeaways: Exploring the ancient port at Beypore Beach, bird watching at Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary, shopping at the Pashmina Boutique, Mananchira Square.3. VarkalaTo indulge my senses to more of sea bliss, I picked out Varkala for a longer stay. The little sea town has a worldwide fame for all the great variety of Ayurvedic services available here. Besides, some of the well-reviewed yoga schools of India I know of have retreat homes along Varkala Beach. A 7-day yoga retreat in Varkala is irresistibly tempting for those seeking refreshment for the body and mind. On reaching Varkala, I called it a week and checked in at a clifftop yoga retreat home overlooking the azure expanse of the Papanasam Beach. Besides guided yoga and meditation classes morning, evening, and night, the retreat program comprehensively covered all possible interests available in Varkala.My Takeaways: Ayurvedic hot oil massage and spa with authentic Ayurvedantists of Varkala at the in-house retreat spa, endless strolls along the beautiful Papanasam Beach, one day trip of Sivagiri Mutt, Varkala Temple, Kappil Lake, Janardana Swami temple, visit Ponnumthuruthu Island near Varkala.4. KovalamThe beaches of Kovalam are bustling with activities aplenty. Backwaters enveloped in a cloud of calm to sail through on lazy afternoons, surf and various water adventure sports on the sea, ayurvedic healing with rejuvenating spa and massage, discovering peppy beach cafes and more, Kovalam is of many shades. I was overjoyed to find a German Bakery outlet, my favorite cafe chain, at one end of the town to brunch every day. Walks along the sea and some early brunches later, I would find something new to do every day. From boating at Vellayani Lake on a catamaran boat with bamboo paddles to swimming, surfing, and parasailing at the lighthouse beach, every day at Kovalam can be a thrill.My Takeaways: Attending Gramam village fair featuring myriad indigenous cultural items, pleasant evenings at Jeevan Music Cafe and one luxuriant night in a houseboat.5. KochiThe old fishing town of Kochi has the perfect setting for quiet romances. Chinese fishing nets dominate photographs taken on the beach and the fishermen folks show tourists how to use the huge nets. Legend has it that the nets were brought from Emperor Kublai Khan of China and introduced to the fishermen folk of India in the 14th century. The Mattancherry Palace, exemplary of Portuguese architecture and the Pardesi Synagogue of Kochi remain two of the most photogenic structures I have found on my journey to Kerala.  My Takeaways: Attending a Kathakali Dance performance at the Kerala Kathakali Center in Kochi, exploring the River Road Boulevard at Fort Kochi and photographing the sun setting behind the mesh of Chinese fishing nets.6. MunnarMy Kerala trip takes a turn for the sublime with Munnar. Oozing freshness and pure bliss, the slopes of Western Ghats in Munnar is as scenic as it gets. Mist covered tea plantations, red-tiled villettes, rare and beautiful flowers blooming in the early winters, and cascading waterfalls– Munnar is truly paradisiacal. My TakeawaysEcological accommodations, treehouse lodgings, tea estate, sanctuary visits and cycling up to Echo Point to get a view. 7. KumarakomThis is another little town, where narrow roads go winding down to a blue seashore. I found ferries going to Pathiramanal Islands, a sweet peaceful nook floating on the sea. The Kumarakom Backwaters too were soulful views. There were enthusiastic birders tripping out to Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary and the waterfalls of Aruvikkuzhi in my shared vehicle, something I noted to do another time.My Takeaways: I had my most serene fill of Kerala backwaters here in Kumarakom.8. Alappuzha or AlleppeyNature-loving tourists flocking to Kerala cannot get enough of Alleppey. I spent a few days indulging in the perfect idyll of little out-of-the-way hamlets near Alleppey in Kuttanad. Thick paddy fields, meandering waterways, shadowy coconut tree lanes, undulating green slopes of spice cultivation, duck farming, and fishing areas of Kuttanad are simply charming. Moving out, Alleppey town has great places to shop for Indian jewelry, typical handicrafts, and artifacts where one can get lots of memorabilia for very little. Luckily I was in town in time for the Nehru Trophy Snake Boat Race which is quite a spectacle.My Takeaways: Exploring backwater haunts, catching the spectacle of snake boat race and sunsets at Pozhiyoram Beach.9. WayanadLocated at the fringe of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Wayanad has Kerala’s most enchanting hills. Sprawling estates of spices and coffee cultivation adorn the slopes. Abundant wildlife, fresh and green landscapes, opportune trekking scopes and unhindered beauty of the wilderness make Wayanad special.My Takeaways: Backpacking to Chembra Peak, fascinating cave paintings of Edakkal caves, clicking pictures at Neelimala View Point and cycling in the tea plantation slopes of Wayanad10. VagamonWinter rains of the south had just washed the landscape clean and glistening verdant when I arrived in Vagamon. There was a glow of emerald all around and the pine tree topped meadows of Vagamon looked welcoming as ever. My Takeaways: Enjoying the solitude of the whispering pine forest thickets, hiking in the meadows, and tea estates around Vagamon11. ThrissurThe culture vulture in me was intrigued to explore Thrissur for its glorious temples, basilicas, and palaces to the backdrop of beautiful nature. The striking white pyres of the Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours are eye-catching and absolutely mesmerizing. The Sakthan Thampuran Palace built by Raja Rama Varma is admirable as a museum of rare antiques and relics from the 16th-century state of Travancore. To an art lover’s delight, the Kollengode Palace of Thrissur housing a Mural Art Museum inside is another attraction in Thrissur.My Takeaways: Extracting the cultural goodness of Kerala touring around museums, palaces, temples, and churches and also a boat ride visit to the village of Chettuva.12. MalampuzhaIn the embrace of verdant forests and soothing lakes, Malampuzha breathes in the freshness of nature. The biggest landmark of nature in the vicinity is the Malampuzha Dam. One day in this little town cradled in the hills is enough to explore the gardens and park of Malampuzha. My Takeaway: Marveling at the artwork made with wastes in Rock Garden, the flower show in the Japanese Park, and picnics at Malampuzha Dam.13. BekalBekal Fort is truly a sight to behold. The wild waves of the Arabian Sea crashed fiercely against the high stone walls of the fort and the contrasting greenery around make it a visual treat. The view from the top is simply magnificent and the howling wind builds up the exoticness here. My Takeaway: Striking photographs of the ancient stone turret of the fort against a stormy sea on a rainy day.14. PonmudiLuxuriant green grassy pastures, tea gardens on gentle slopes and hairpin turn rods give Ponmudi a chilly winter feeling. I ended my Kerala trip here before going back to Thiruvananthapuram. My Takeaway: Leisurely walk down gentle slopes, watching tea pluckers perform their everyday chores, exploring birdlife, visit Ponmudi Rock and Mankayam Waterfalls.ConclusionFrom dabbling in the annals of South Indian history and heritage to finding my zen amidst nature so pristine, I found Kerala every bit amazing and my journey here was truly transformative. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/varanasi-india/,"Varanasi, India – Ceremony, Tourism and Death on the Ganges (Video #103)",India,"We sat in a circle on small plastic stools in the tiny shop enjoying our lassis, a refreshing yogurt based treat in India. Our conversation was interrupted every few minutes by a procession of mourners heading down to a ghat on the Ganges river with the body of some deceased loved one on their shoulders. The body was covered with a simple shroud. Mourners called out “ram naam satya hai” which means “truth is the name of Lord Rama”. They were taking the body to the river bank to be cremated. Welcome to Varanasi India. Varanasi is different. It gets a great deal of tourists like the Taj Mahal at Agra but it lacks a single stunning architectural wonder. The attraction is the people of India and their hindu faith. Varanasi is a holy city to hindus along the bank of the equally holy Ganges river in the northern Indian state of  Uttar Pradesh. Holy CowWe arrived in Varanasi on a night train from New Delhi and it was obvious from our initial tuk-tuk ride to our hotel that the visit to Varanasi would be different. We had seen a few cows wandering the streets of New Delhi but when we did it was noticeable as they were infrequent. In Varanasi, there were so many and our tuk-tuk divers would drive so close to them that you really had to keep an eye out lest you run into one as you leaned out of the tuk-tuk to take a picture of the colorful vendors.  All of this was done to the constant soundtrack of traffic and the ubiquitous honking of horns.At least once, members of our group were charged by cows not so much with malice but with indifference to our presence. In a country where even McDonald’s doesn’t serve beef they get pretty confident and we had to scramble out of the way as they quickly descended the stairs along the shore of the Ganges.The GangesWe took a pedicab from our hotel which was outside the hubbub of downtown Varanasi. The pedicabs, motorcycles, and tuk-tuks jostled their way uncertainly but inevitably towards the Ganges River.Along the Ganges at Varanasi are a series of 88 different places called ghats which have steps down into the river. At most of these you can find people ceremonially washing themselves.At a couple them (Manikarnika ghat and Harishchandra ghat) you can find bodies being cremated and then scattered on the waters of the Ganges. This is done in  the belief this will help the loved one achieve moksha, the end of the cycle of reincarnation. Why would you want to do this? Because, as I understand it, hindus believe that life is struggle. Moksha translates as liberation.SunriseThe various ghats are a place of worship (or puja) all day long but this is punctuated with special ceremonies at sunrise and sunset. At sunrise we visited a ghat where 7 young priests (always an odd number) were chanting behind 7 different braziers filled with incense. It is an ancient ceremony. The chanting sounded repetitive to my western ears. We stood a bit apart with other curious tourists.Sunrise Boat TripOne of the highlights of our visit was boarding a small wooden boat for a tour along the river as the city appeared out of the mist and smoke of its morning reverie. Along the side of the river we passed the different ghats with holy men and ordinary men and women bathing. Hindus believe that the water of the Ganges is pure and that bathing washes away sins and helps to achieve moksha. While the water may be spiritually pure, we did see at least one carcass of a dead goat and it is not unheard of to see bodies of those who can’t afford cremation floating down the river. The sun slowly forced its way through the mist and smoke which shroud the river. I burned through one battery on my camera and threatened to fill up my camera’s memory card with photos of the colorful boats and the misty etherial shore.Everywhere on shore there were the colorful Indian women and their monochrome husbands and sons.Here and there a multicolor holy man stood out as a stark contrast.We passed a flotilla of other boats like ours filled with tourists.We passed numerous temples including Ratneshwar Mahadev which is known as the leaning temple. There are multiple legends associated with the temple but the one our guide told us was that it was built by a king named Man Singh to repay his mother for all she had done for him, but, as everyone knows, it is impossible to pay the debt that is owed to your mother so the temple was cursed by his mother.We passed the large piles of wood topped with a body which slowly turned to ash. Here we put away our cameras as it is inappropriate to film what is a very personal and, to the hindus, a very sacred process. We passed two different Bollywood movie casts filming a musical dance scene.  ExploringDuring the day we explored the various ghats and back alleys of Varanasi. We shopped for spices and clothes. There are bargains to be had in these small side streets. We watched a local girl feed a monkey at her window. As I mention we stopped for lassies at Blue Lassi. The lassis are served in a biodegradable bowl which is just left in the street and breaks down to dirt. Granted it is an odd if seminal experience to be enjoying a delicious lassi while witnessing public mourning.What they don’t mention about the sacred cows is that they leave cow pies just like secular ones. We had to keep a sharp eye as we walked around town to avoid the “holy crap”.Ramnagar FortWe crossed the Ganges and toured the Ramnagar Fort. Photos were not allowed inside the fort but sadly they would have shown a fort in disrepair, with museum exhibits covered in dust. It could be a significant tourism spot but may not be worth the effort to visit at this time. Sunset Boat RideWe boarded a boat again at sunset. We paused on our journey down the river to light small candles and let them adrift on the river with our prayers. The candle boats like the lassi bowls are biodegradable. At a few of the larger ghats there is a colorful, noisy, smokey, fire-filled evening ceremony. Again there are always an odd number of priests twirling fire and chanting. While this is happening onshore, there is a flotilla of boats full of tourists clustered gunnel to gunnel in the river with young chi vendors selling their wares as they hop from one boat to another.Varanasi is an old city, dating back to at least 1800 B.C. Varanasi is spectacle and devotion, delicious and challenging, unpolished and captivating. Varanasi is India.I was in Varanasi as part of a larger trip from Intrepid Travel called Indian Getaway which also included Deli, Agra, Jaipur and a village visit.PodcastFor more about this trip listen to Travel to India – Amateur Traveler Episode 590 Hear more about our trip in Amateur Traveler India Trip – Amateur Traveler Episode 590 or check out all my photos from Varanasi.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/riding-night-train-india/,Riding the Night Train in India,India,"The train rumbled and bounced along the tracks as we all tried to sleep. Sometimes the train would lull you to sleep with its steel on steel lullaby. Sometimes it would shake you awake, with its jerking from side to side, like a friend desperate to tell you the house was on fire. I awoke in the morning expecting to be pulling into the station at Agra, with thoughts of our upcoming visit to the Taj Mahal. I found instead we had almost half our journey ahead of us still. Somewhere in the night, something had gone amiss and we were delayed by hours. Such is life in the Indian rail system.Our guide Pancham shared a secret of the Indian Rail system. They publish the percentage of trains that arrive on time. Once your train is delayed they continue to delay it more rather than delay another train. It makes their numbers better. Somewhere in the night, we had drawn the short straw.We settled back into our bunks, 3 bunks high in most of the train, with 2 high on the narrow side of the aisle, 8 bunks in an alcove, 8 alcoves, with no doors in between them. 64 people in our car with nothing to do but wait and hope the chai vendor would bring us his small cups of spiced tea that are one of the many moments of joy in India.Unlike our first night train from Delhi to Varanasi this one had no dining car that would regularly send out its goods like hot samosas to the train’s passengers. But on the slow train, there is plenty of time to buy food from vendors who would meet the train at the many small stations where it stopped. Because this is India, there is also a smartphone app (Comesum) you can use to order food from a station ahead of you.We folded up the middle bunk and turned the lower bunk back into a bench for sitting and conversing, although we seemed to have lost our conversation somewhere along the way. We stared out the windows through the haze that covers India in November at the small fields, brickworks, temples, and villages along the route from Varanasi to Agra. The landscape was an array of browns and greens occasionally dotted with the vibrant saris of Indian women or the muted monochromes of the Indian men.There was time to consider ourselves fortunate that while we were in second class, we were in the second class sleeper with air conditioning. On this extremely long train, there is a car for every pocketbook. There is a second class sleeper without air conditioning, a second class without air conditioning and without sleeping bunks. At the far end of the train are the cars where there are no reserved seats. We watched as the passengers for this car jumped on the train before it stopped as it pulled into the station, anxious to find a place to sit. They passed small children from one set of hands to another while running alongside of the train.Presumably, somewhere ahead there was a 1st class car, with a life you can only dream of, always moving away and somehow staying just out of one’s reach.We checked our luggage which was locked below our seats with cables and locks we had brought. Had we forgotten ours we could have bought them at the station. I did not sleep well on the first night on the train as I worried about the possibility of theft. My daughter had a friend whose shoes were stolen off her feet while she slept on a night train. My shoes sat in the mesh pocket on the wall in my bunk. We slept in a group, took our precautions and had no problems. But, that was the first trip. Now we were veterans and sleep was easy… when the train would stop shaking me awake.Even with the delay, the Indian train system is amazingly efficient. Our train easily had over 1,000 passengers, probably over 2,000. You line up for these long trains at the sign on the platform that indicates the number of the car. The signs at the station indicate which train is on which track in English and the local language.There are restrooms on both ends of the train. They were cleaner than the night trains we had taken in China, with a western toilet at one end of the car (bring your own tissues). Our first train had been relatively new, but this one looked battered by time and use. I could see through to the tracks on from cracks in the floor of the restroom. It looked like a car that had seen thousands and thousands of passengers moving from place to place.The train lumbered on. Some put back on their eyeshade or put back in their earplugs, crawled under the sheets and coarse blankets the train provided or into the sleep sack they thought to bring and went back to sleep. Some pulled out their snacks they had bought for the journey. Some drank from their water bottles. Some read. Some conversed. Some plugged in their smartphones and listened to their podcasts. Almost all bought and drank chai when it was offered.There are more than 90,000 miles of train tracks in India. It is a people on the move. Moving efficiently, moving confidently but sometimes, some days, moving just a bit slower than you might like.I was traveling with a group of Amateur Traveler listeners with Intrepid Travel and we were taking their “Indian Getaway” tour. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/10-unexplored-places-india/,10 Unexplored Places in India,India,"India is a very interesting country, that’s getting more popular for tourists, probably because there are many things you can see only there. India is a whole new world. Official statistics say that the number of tourist arrivals in India has increased by 97% in the past ten years.However, most of these tourists visit the big cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, the ghats of Varanasi, the beaches of Goa, or few spots in the Himalayas like Manali, Kasol, and Rishikesh. I lived in India for a year, I met many tourists and expats, but only a few people I met visited some of the places that I am going to write about today. So I thought I should give these places some love by mentioning them in this article since they are definitely worth a visit.10. South Andaman IslandI’ve seen Goa and I have seen many other beaches across India in my year there. After that, I can claim that Goa doesn’t have the most beautiful beach in the country. There are two places in India with beaches even more amazing than Goa. And this is one of them. The island has a lot of great spots for scuba diving and skydiving as well. It’s always more adventurous when you skydive over an island. And the sigh is much nicer as well. You can also visit a nearby island known as Barren Island, a home to the only active volcano in South Asia.9. ShilongShillong, known among locals as ‘The Scotland of the East’, was one of my favorite places during my journey to this part of India. I will never forget the blue mountains, the lush green forests filled with romantic rivers accompanied by waterfalls, the amazing wildlife, and most importantly the wonderful traditions and rituals wrapped around the mist, which seemed ubiquitous in the Northeast, especially Shillong.8. SrinagarThe real challenge is the temperature difference is really difficult in the beginning. When I visited I was coming to Delhi, where the temperature was around 45 degrees, and in Srinagar, the temperature even dropped below 0 in the night. Srinagar is an amazing city. A lot of its charm comes from its two lakes: Dal Lake and Wular Lake. The city is also home to one of the biggest floating markets in India. You can buy literally everything here, including hash and weed, if you’re into this stuff.7. TuraTura is another small, but beautiful town surrounded by lush forests and hills in the state of Meghalaya. Tura is known for its Siju Caves, which is one of the longest caves in Asia. Other highlights include the Tura peak that will give you an amazing view of Tura and Balpakram, which is the real place for you if you’re a fan of tribal stories and folklore. If you go to India in search for new spiritual dimensions, this is definitely one of those places.6. Silent Valley National ParkThis is my favorite National Park in India. Located in the state of Kerala, Silent Valley national park is one of the most amazing gifts from nature to mankind. The lush forests make the temperature bearable, and the humidity is lower compared to the rest of India. The most impressive part about Silent Valley is the wildlife: 34 species of mammals, 292 species of birds, 31 species of reptiles, 22 species of amphibians, 13 species of fishes, 500 species of butterflies and moths, besides a multitude of lower forms of animal life most of which are yet to be documented.5. Nubra ValleyNubra valley is a cold desert located in the Northern state of Kashmir, geographically belonging to the Tibetian Plateau. Some amazing things to see here are the sand dunes, the three-humped camels, which can only be found in three other places in the entire world and Turtuk- the village of serenity that became open for tourists after 2010. Many people don’t visit Nubra because of the conflict between India and Pakistan. However, during my last visit a couple of months ago I can say the entire region was looking pretty peaceful.4. GangtokGangtok, the capital of Sikkim is another amazing place. The entire city is built on a hill and you’re practically hiking even if you want to go from your hotel to the supermarket. Gangtok and Sikkim are other examples of how diverse India as a country is. The people look similar to the people from the Land of the Seven sisters; a term used for the 7 states of northeast India. But Sikkimese traditions and customs are different than the other states. Even I thought that Sikkim was a part of the 7 sisters until I visited.3. LadakhLadakh- the land of high passes, untouched nature, mystic lamas, snowy mountains, and caring people. Another notorious place, according to the media, which is home not only to unreal winter beauty but also to some of the most caring people I have met. The people of Ladakh is what makes this cold piece of land so warm. There are only two roads that leave to this city, and both of them are in a really bad condition and under snow through a large part of the year. So Ladakh can basically stay isolated from the rest of the world if the weather Gods decide to be violent.2. Nicobar IslandAt the beginning of the article, I said that there’s one place in India with beaches better than Goa. That’s definitely Nicobar. This is an island with untouched nature. The island is filled with dense forests and dreamy beaches like I haven’t seen anywhere else. What makes this place special are the tribal belts that divide the island. Yes, there actually are tribal people living here, but the access to this area is forbidden for tourists.1. Aksai ChinAksai Chin is another place located in Kashmir, which is my personal favorite. This place is located on the ceasefire line between China and India. This place has been notoriously called ‘One of the most dangerous places in the world’. I don’t know how it was a few years ago, but when I visited there it was completely safe. For some reason, the Indian media wants the rest of the country to think that Kashmir is a dangerous place, but the reality is a bit different. When I arrived at the notorious place, there was literally no one else there. Just me, the snowy mountains, heavenly lakes, and cold deserts. The highlight of Aksai Chin is Pangong Lake, located at more than 5,700 meters above ground, giving you a view that looks like it was made in Photoshop or designed for a fairy-tale.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/five-benefits-of-professional-volunteering-in-india/,5 Benefits of Professional Volunteering in India,India,"Most people go to India as observers, taking in the sights, sounds, and smells of a country far different from their own. After teacher training college I remember some of my classmates pulling the India card as a way to fend off the threat of imminent job applications.Now firmly into my own career, I’d often wondered what it would be like to visit India not as a tourist, but as a volunteer. Would I enjoy it? Would I learn anything? And, perhaps most importantly, would a country with its own burgeoning professional class even want a well-wishing westerner?It was with great relief that I discovered that the answers were yes, yes, and yes. My experience in India changed how I am and how I see the world on quite a fundamental level. Rather than bang on about mystical experiences, however, here are what I consider the top five reasons for professionals to arrange a placement in the country.Challenging perceptionsI’ll admit I hadn’t been traveling for a while, but my shock on arrival in India wasn’t something I was quite prepared for. After the sleepy suburbia of Bath, the assault on nose, ears, and eyes took some getting used to.Travel through the country on bouncy bus, sardine-tin-like train and on the back of a moped is a learning experience, and learning is something that every teacher needs to do once in a while.TimeRather than the regimented strictness of UK time, Indians have a more flexible approach to the clock. While my working hours in Amar Seva Sangam’s middle school were a fairly standard 9 am to 5 pm with an hour for lunch, outside the confines of the school, things were a little different.The official working week in India runs from Monday to Saturday, from 9 am to 6 pm. It is common, however, for Indians to arrive at work at 11 am and to work until as late as 11 pm. Similarly, social events may have a start time of 8 pm, but I quickly learned that if you turn up on time, you’ll be waiting for at least an hour before anyone else arrives.Learning to accept that things don’t always happen on time is a valuable lesson for any westerner.Redefining the roleI thought I knew what teaching was about. After all, I’d been doing it for more than eight years. Once in the classroom, however, a lot of it went out the window. Of course, I knew it was going to be a different experience, but I found I really had to adapt to teaching in India.The classes were large – up to 40 children – so I found it difficult at first not being able to focus on each individual student. The children were very well behaved and respectful, however, so classroom management wasn’t something that I had to focus on a great deal. Perhaps the hardest thing was the mixture of levels in the class – some of the children had not been exposed to English from an early age, and many of the children struggled with conversational English. I, therefore, had to group students, set different level tasks and focus much more on speaking.My ability to adapt to a different way of teaching in India has definitely helped me to develop into a better teacher.ExperimentationFreed from the rigors of state teaching, I found myself able to experiment with my methods. I was able to plan, prepare and deliver lessons in the ways I saw fit. If I noticed that the children were making similar mistakes with an aspect of language, I would stop and spend the next few lessons focusing on this. I asked the students what topics they wanted to cover and planned lessons accordingly. There were also few resources at the school, which meant I became more creative, making my own worksheets and flashcards.Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t, but the experience of trying out things my way was intensely satisfying and intellectually nourishing.Something to shareMy British students love hearing about my time in India. I hope I have been able to inspire them with an interest in the world beyond Britain. My experiences have become their experiences, which has subsequently inspired me to arrange a kind of international pen pal scheme with my students and my (ex) Indian students.This article was written for Projects Abroad PRO, an organization that helps graduates, those on a career break and retired professionals to find more information about volunteering in India and many other countries around the globe. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/5-states-in-india-that-you-must-visit/,5 States In India That You Must Visit,India,"www.tripcrafters.comA trip to India is filled with promises of beautiful landscapes, a rich culture and heritage and great diversity. Each state in the country has so much to offer that your itinerary may not be able to encompass all of it. So here are the 5 states you absolutely must visit when you’re here. It may not be a lot but it’s enough to summon you back.Madhya PradeshThe first state on this list is Madhya Pradesh. If the Incredible India advertisement for the state wasn’t enough to have you go there, I hope this article is impetus enough. Located at the heart of the country, MP (as it’s conveniently called) is filled with gorgeous heritage structures.With hot summers and cool winters, the state offers a very comfortable climate to travel in.Known for its vast reservoir of flora and fauna, MP is home to 9 national parks and records the highest population of tigers in the state. Some of the popular parks are Kanha National Park, Bandhavgarh National Park and Sanjay National Park.MP also is home to a sizeable tribal population. You could visit districts like Mandla and Jhabua to mingle with the tribal population and get a flavor of the tribal way of living.An absolute must visit is Khajuraho. The temples of Khajuraho are famous world over and are known for their magnificent erotic sculptures. Once inside the temples compound, you are transported to a different world altogether.Another point of interest is the Buddhist temples at Sanchi. Famous world over and significant to all Buddhist pilgrims, the Sanchi stupas are emblematic of the tranquility and peace the Buddhist philosophy preaches so well.GujaratProbably one of the most industrialized states in the country, with superfast economic growth, Gujarat is located on the western coast of India. It is steeped in India’s modern history, with the Dandi March led by Mahatma Gandhi. Besides its role in the independence, Gujarat is also an extremely vibrant state.Celebration, cuisine and clothes are the three reasons why you need to go to Gujarat. If you go during the Navratri time (9 days festival celebrated in honor of the goddess Durga), you are going to see Gujarat in its liveliest form. People in the state celebrate the festival with the folk tradition of garba where they dance to folk songs in the brightest, most colorful and gorgeous folk dresses.Gujarati food is an absolute relish. Simple, light and delightful, traditional Gujarati food is a superb treat for your taste buds with a great balance of sweet and salty.Ahmedabad is a must visit. You could see the campus of the mighty and majestic IIM-A. You could also shop here for gorgeous, traditional, Gujarati clothes. Loads of color, lots of mirrored work and batik prints – it’s a great place to take away a little something of Gujarat back with you.Gujarat is also home to a number of national parks, therefore those looking for a bit of flora and fauna can find it right here. The Gir Forest National Park is the only place where you can find Asiatic Lions in their natural habitat!Sabarmati Ashram is a must visit for all those who want to learn more about Mahatma Gandhi’s life.  While there are a number of museums dedicated to Gandhi, Sabarmati Ashram is like none other.Gujarat stands out for me simply because its culture is so unique. That’s something you definitely will want to experience.PunjabThis state is exactly like you see it in the typical Bollywood movies – sprawling acres of mustard fields, the typical Punjabi villages – it’s all the same. The best thing about the state are its people – loud, extremely warm and welcoming, and fully entertaining. Rooted in folk culture, Punjab is an enchanting experience.Located in the north-west part of India, Punjab is recognized as producing the largest number of soldiers in the Indian army. It’s rooted in India’s struggle for independence and comes with its own stories of struggle and patriotism.Amritsar is an absolute must visit for the magnificent Golden Temple and the Jallianwala Bagh. Chandigarh, the capital of the state, is a fairly modern city and extremely well-planned.You can visit the more remote parts of the state to experience the true Punjabi culture with the folk dances and music.Since agriculture is the main occupation in the state, a trip to the countryside offers you a beautiful sight of acres of fields spread out in either direction.One excellent reason to go to Punjab is the cuisine. Everywhere in the state, you’ll find delightful food. Fish tikka and chicken tandoori are absolute must try dishes. A hearty Punjabi meal is an experience itself, a memorable one that will leave you extremely satisfied.MeghalayaWhile all the states in the north-east part of the country are worth a trip, I’m going to narrow it down to Meghalaya. The state’s a hilly strip and is known for its large Khasia, Jaintia and Garo populations.The state is home to a great biodiversity – plants, animals, birds and forests. It is also home to large tribal groups. So for all those interested in a little bit of tribal life, visit to tribal dominated districts in the state is a must.The state is also known for its breath-taking waterfalls. Some popular ones are the Elephant falls, the Bishop falls and the must see Nohkalikai Falls.Shillong, the capital, contains every reason to visit Meghalaya. It’s known as the cultural hub of the North-East and is famous for its amazing music scene. You have bands performing in different parts of the city. Once here, you have to listen to the famous and grand Shillong choir. They’re mesmerizing!Once here, you have to try the momos because they’re just jaw dropping yum!Shillong is also perfect for camping. The Shillong Peak is extremely high and makes for a delightful trek for all those who like to rough it out.If you’re looking to escape from the hustle bustle of the city and find some peace, Meghalaya is the state to be in. What acts as the perfect icing on the cake is that the people here are extremely sweet and welcoming.RajasthanThis state in the north-western part of the country is a gorgeous state. Unique in itself, it is rooted in a great cultural heritage. With cities like Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer and Udaipur to visit, the state is ideal for a holiday spot.It offers a varied landscape with both hills and the desert. Jaisalmer is perfect to explore the deserts, especially on camel rides. Udaipur is home to gorgeous palaces and beautiful lakes. It’s also seeped in Rajput history, so you’re bound to be overwhelmed by the royalty that the city is enveloped in. Jaipur is a great place to shop for traditional Rajasthani prints known as bandini and some amazing jewelry both silver and junk. Ajmer is a great place to connect with your spiritual side.What’s gorgeous about Rajasthan is its folk culture- it’s vibrant and colorful. Rajasthan is also home to some brilliant folk musicians, so when you visit, you must attend a concert. Rajasthani food also makes for a wonderful cuisine, so that’s definitely something you need to try.The state also houses extremely famous national parks such as Ranthambore, Sariska and the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary.Visit the forts and carved havelis in the state and rewind to the rich Rajput dynasty.This post is sponsored by tripcrafters.com, which can help you travel to india – http://www.tripcrafters.com/travel/india/Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/deserts-and-fairytales-in-rajasthan-india/,"Deserts and Fairytales in Rajasthan, India",India,"If there is a typical image of India it is the famous ‘Golden Triangle’, which includes Delhi, Agra and Jaipur. Many people fly into Delhi and take a trip around this triangle before flying back out again, without ever venturing further. While there is nothing wrong with that – it is such a well-trodden path because it includes some of the most fascinating places in India – there is much to be seen not far away. Jaipur is not just part of the Golden Triangle, but the gateway to Rajasthan. This is a state which can take you back to the extravagant world of the maharajahs, through some of the most rural and isolated parts of the country, and into some of its most unusual and exciting cities. Everywhere you step, there are stories of the past, which creep imperceptibly into the present.Jaipur – the Pink CityMost trips around Rajasthan start in Jaipur. It is a city-within-a-city: the walled Pink City and the modern city beyond it. The Pink City itself is huge and is not a preserved ‘antique’, but is the beating heart of the Jaipur that lies beyond it. Many roads are wide and choked with traffic, and there are plenty of thriving commercial businesses. It is busy and hectic, tourists mixing with shoppers who teem around shops grouped by what they sell – a street of spice-sellers, then a street of saucepan sellers. Further into the maze, things calm. The Jantar Mantar Observatory dates from the eighteenth century, with yellow and pink stone instruments: steps that reach up to the sky, huge sundials. Then there is the City Palace: a vast complex of pavilions, gardens and columns that is a joy just to wander around.Jodhpur – the Blue CityJodphur has a much calmer feel, helped by the blue that most of its houses are painted. The colour matches the sky perfectly, giving the place an otherworldly feel. The inner city is a mess of tiny alleyways running of larger streets packed with shops and guesthouses. It feels surprisingly quiet, the back-streets not disturbed by much except the odd cow and the occasional motorbike which roars through out of nowhere. The city is at the foot of a hill, on which the Mehrangarh Fort is built. This was home to generations of Rajasthani Kings, who looked out over their kingdom from behind its windows, surrounded by gold and armies of servants.Udaipur – the City of LakesUdaipur is dominated by lakes and palaces, all of them painted white. It is pure romance: no doubt many proposals have been made on the banks of those lakes, and many young relationships started. Sadly, the lakes are not as full as they once were, but the palaces which sit on their banks in the middle of them still retain their grandeur. The largest of the palaces is the Lake Palace, now a five star hotel, made of white marble which is lit up at night, reflecting into the water around it. The City Palace sits on the banks of the same lake, looking out to the Lake Palace. Its terraces are a wonderful place to sit and gain some perspective on the city.JaisalmerJaisalmer is the most remote of the large Rajasthani cities. The modern city is low and dusty, the real attraction is the old city: Jaisalmer Fort. The Fort rises out of the desert like a fairytale castle rising into the sky. Walking up to it, you feel as if you are starting to disappear into another world. Once in, you find narrow, alleys for streets, small squares full of chatter, and children playing on the battlements which surround it. The views stretch for miles over the flat desert around it. Camel trips out into the desert are popular, passing tiny villages, and sleeping under the stars with the camels. More than anywhere in Rajasthan, it is a place you can forget the rest of the world exists in.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/when-empty-is-good-or-3-days-with-hh-dalai-lama/,3 Days with the Dalai Lama,India,"It’s a mystery to meWe have a greedWith which we have agreedWhen you think you have to want more than you needUntil you have it all you won’t be freedSpiti Valley is a remote, almost isolated region in the north-east of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, about 100 km from the Tibetan border. The valley is quiet, road traffic is minimal and villagers live off the land and do not have much need to venture beyond their homes. The capital village (not city or town, but village) is sleepy Kaza. But for three days, Kaza was buzzing as His Holiness the Dalai Lama flew in for a visit.Police officer keeping the peaceThe day he arrived, the main road of Kaza was lined on one side with thousands of people, mostly Spitian and Tibetan families and Buddhist monks and nuns. Chai vendors who always seem to find a way to sell their chai everywhere in India were also present, setting up temporary chai stalls just across from the gompa (monastery). Security was very high and Indian police with their AK-47s were everywhere, amongst the crowds and perched on top of roofs nearby. One major downside to all this security was that no cameras were allowed into the gompa while HH Dalai Lama was there so I didn’t get any pictures of him.Burning incenseI pressed my luck and brought my big SLR with me up to the front gate figuring I could talk my way into bringing it in. No luck. I ended up having to go all the way back to my guest house to drop it off and then returning. He came to Kaza inaugurate the new gompa, to share some knowledge about emptiness and impermanence and to initiate those who wished to be into the way of Avalokitshevara, the Buddha of Compassion. The most recognized Buddhist mantra, “Om Mane Padme Om”, is a mantra from this Buddha that brings compassion to those who say the mantra.Buddhist nuns awaiting His Holiness’s arrivalBeing initiated into this mantra allows the chanter of the mantra to gain the benefits of it. Which makes me wonder what happened to all those times I’ve said that mantra before this initiation. Spitian culture and language is similar to Tibetan culture and language and the primary religion in the valley is Tibetan Buddhism. Not surprisingly, it seemed that every Spitian from the valley came to Kaza for these talks. Add to that a couple of hundred Westerners and you’ve got a village where all the hotels are fully booked and power outages are happening every night as the power grid in Kaza wasn’t designed to handle so many people.Family waiting alongside the roadHH Dalai Lama had a few hundred tents set up au gratis (as opposed to au gratin) near the river for those who couldn’t find accommodation or couldn’t afford it. I had heard that he really takes care of practicalities for those coming to see him talk and it really did seem like it. As we sat and listened to him talk, monks would be walking by serving butter tea and bread. If you’ve never had butter tea before then consider yourself lucky.Welcome HHDL!It is more like a salty broth than tea. It is an oily white concoction that looks somewhat appetizing till you take a sip and wish you could Ctrl-Z that last action. Luckily my friend Tamsin loved the stuff so I’d keep giving her mine as I continued trying it each day thinking that it would somehow be better. I met up with Tamsin in my shared jeep ride from Manali to Kaza, along with Marni and Lindsay, two sisters from the States, and Penpa, a 28 year old Tibetan guy who somehow is always smiling and laughing, and this after I’ve been traveling with him for a couple of weeks now.Buddhist monkWe all clicked really well as the group is quite positive and easy going and our self-dubbed “family” ended up sharing one big room during our stay in Kaza. Each morning around 7 a.m. a couple of us would head out early to the gompa (monastery) to try and save a few places for the group. Locals and Tibetans had the prime location right in front HH Dalai Lama while the foreigners were off to the side, with a good view of his left side. So many locals turned out that they began moving into the foreigners section and soon outnumbered all of us.The main gompaThe talks were all in Tibetan but thanks to this advanced technology called the “radio” and a live translator sitting among us, we were able to tune our radios into 97.9 FM and catch the live translation. While we were waiting for the talks to begin, a monk was chanting “Om Mane Padme Om” rapidly and repeatedly over the speaker system. I thought there was a 50-50 chance he would achieve enlightenment that morning with the pace at which he was chanting.His helicopter makes a loop overheadAround 9 a.m. HH Dalai Lama would arrive and we all stood as he made his way to the front of his throne, bent down to rest on his knees and did his three prostrations to the throne. Once he was seated then the ritual was for people to do three prostrations to him before taking our seats. For someone in his 70’s, he is still a pretty fit man. He managed to do the prostrations and climbed into his throne on his own strength. And he spoke with a strong and at times animated voice. But the best part about seeing HH Dalai Lama speak, even not understanding Tibetan, is just hearing his infectious laugh. It comes unannounced and can come at any time.Monks and nuns line the streetDuring the initiation ceremony, as he was saying his prayers and chanting a mantra, in every way a serious ceremony, there was a pause, and then you just hear this “heh heh heh”. And that is just the start. He continues a few more times. “Heh heh heh,” and you can’t help but laugh too. He’s got a childlike, but not childish, way about him. When he was not talking, such as when the Hindi translator was repeating what was just said to the audience, HH Dalai Lama would be gently rocking back and forth or side to side in his throne, looking out at the crowd.Buddhist monk in traditional headdressSometimes he would reach into his robe, pull out a tissue and wipe his glasses, dry his eyes or blow his nose. Then when the Hindi translator was through and it was time to speak again, he would in an almost casual way just lean towards the microphone and say “Oh yeah. Okay.” When all the pre-talking rites and rituals were completed, we sat down, opened up our notebooks and tuned our radios in to 97.9 FM. “Relax, enjoy the bread and enjoy the tea. And listen to me also. Heh heh heh.” And with that we began the teachings.“What is I?”“Does I have a beginning or not?”“Does I have an end or not?”Those were the questions he began with. He compared the answers to these questions as they would be answered from the perspectives of the different major religions in the world. At no point did HH Dalai Lama every claim that one religion was more correct than another, but instead encouraged people to follow the religions of our parents but with knowledge and harmony of other religions.“What is I?” You can also ask “What is this computer?” The point of the exercise is to try and identify the one thing, one piece, that you can say “Aha, that is I, or that is the computer.” You’ll find you can’t.Things come into existence through mere designation. Analyze any object and you’ll find that you can’t find it. Here is an example. Let’s say you’re taking a walk on a mountain. You pick up a beautiful rock, then you throw it into the river below.Wake me up when he gets hereIs this still a mountain? What if you throw 100 more rocks of the mountain? What if a billion rocks are thrown off the mountain till there is just a handful left? At what point does it stop being a mountain? When people stop calling it a mountain. This is the foundation of emptiness, one of the final teachings of Buddhism. The notion of emptiness in Buddhism basically means that nothing in this world exists on its own, that nothing exists independently of anything else. We designate things as ‘a mountain’, ‘a car’, or ‘I’ because we have this notion of duality, that there is an independent I and each object we see is also independent. But this is a completely false view.Take the computer you’re using right now as an example. It is made up of many parts, each of which was built and assembled by a machine or a person.Monks and nuns lining up with their kattasBefore that, an engineer designed how this computer should be built, and he probably used a white board to draw up his ideas. (Note, I am making a strong assumption that the engineers who designed your computer were males. I should know given the ratio of males/females in my computer engineering classes in college). The white board itself was probably made in a factory and includes chemicals that were created in a lab by a scientist who drove his Ford Escort to work. The Ford Escort was assembled by people and machines in Dayton, Ohio. Etc. Etc. So all of those things played a role in you having this computer in front of you. By the way I’m probably not doing justice to how HH Dalai Lama explained this and even as I’m reading through mine and Lindsay’s notes I’m having trouble explaining it, so apologies if this doesn’t make too much sense.Buddhist monkIt is difficult stuff to comprehend! But that’s what I like about Buddhism. It is very analytical, based on analyzing and understanding your own experiences, your thoughts, behaviors and emotions. In many ways it is more science than religion. The other thing he spent a lot of time talking about was attachment and impermanence, that nothing in this world is eternal and yet we cling to everything as though they will last forever. We cling to our material possessions, our relationships and even more importantly, to our lives, as though we expect them to be here for all time. Another exercise he had us try was to find anything in this world that is impermanent, something that will never change.Two young monks sharing some FantaI was tempted to mention the fact that the Detroit Lions total of zero Super Bowl championships was a number that would probably never change in a million lifetimes. But other than that, you’ll find it impossible. Everything changes. That George Foreman grill you got for Christmas two years ago probably looks a lot different now than it did when you unwrapped it. And twenty years from now it’ll probably be in some scrap heap in New Jersey. Your new car is no longer new soon after you leave the lot. Nothing doesn’t change.And from all of this we are to extrapolate that yes, even we, with these super duper bodies of ours are impermanent. Even with our Kirkland Signature daily-multi-vitamin supplements and Cod Liver fish oil tablets and our three-times-a-week gym routine, we’re still going to fade away.Warming up the bandSo if this is all true, then why do we have such strong attachments to things, to people, to our own lives even? It is a futile exercise. On the flip side, I think there is a danger here when one begins thinking that if nothing lasts then that means that nothing matters. That is completely opposite to the point HH Dalai Lama is trying to make it. We should appreciate what we have in each moment when we have it but when it is gone, we should let it go and not get caught up trying to bring it back. This is a really hard thing to do for many reasons. We live in a world where we are measured by the mountains of material possessions we have. We become so attached to these things and to the perception they help us project of ourselves to others that we fight tooth and nail to keep the things we have. If someone scratches your car door, steals your camera, spills your beer, blood pressure rises accordingly.On a side note, there is something about long term traveling that makes you stop caring so much about your material possessions. I think it has to do with the fact that all of your belongings are in your backpack and so you end up having way less things than you would at home. And you begin to realize that you don’t really need so much to get by or be happy in this world (just an iPhone and some Indian curry is good enough for me). When you begin accumulating too many things, you can physically feel the burden of the extra weight on your back. At home you simply shove them into your storage closet that has become a veritable Jenga-game-in-waiting and forget about it.There were three days of talks and I’ve only tried to capture the general idea of what he spoke about. It isn’t the hardest stuff in the world to understand but it is difficult to absorb and just writing it out here has been a good challenge in recalling everything we heard.We did have one very curious happening. The day before the Avalokitshevara initiation we were given strands of kusha grass to place under our pillow and mattress at night. It was intended to keep away bad dreams and perhaps also give us pleasant dreams. The intention is to basically protect us during the couple of days of the initiation. The next morning as we were walking to the gompa, I asked Lindsay and Marni if they had any dreams. Marni, like me, hadn’t had any dreams that she could remember but Lindsay had a dream where she had visited many different Buddhist temples.HH Dalai Lama began his talks that morning talking about the kusha grass and the interpretation of the dreams. The first thing he said was “If you had any dreams about visiting temples, then that is a good dream.” We were floored. This was exactly Lindsay’s dream. But before we could get too excited about it, he reminded all of us that “good or bad dreams, remember that they are gone now so don’t put too much importance on them.”In other words, don’t get attached.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/roop-kund-my-himalayan-death-trek/,Roopkund Trek: My Himalayan Death Trek – India,India,"I spent the whole summer of 2003 exploring India. After the first few weeks of hot and dusty excursions through the plains — checking out temples and riding overnight trains — I went up to the cool summer hill station of Almora to relax and unwind for a week.In a local chai shop, I came across an yellowed old guidebook with a short description of Roopkund – a mysterious, high-altitude lake that was nestled in the crux of Trishul (23,359 ft.). The small lake was filled with several hundred human skeletons frozen in the ice for most of the year.  Scientists who analyzed the skeletons believe that they were religious pilgrims in the 12th to 15th century, who got caught in a ferocious hailstorm and perished.Wow!Roopkund lake was less than 100 miles from where I was. I quickly forgot all about relaxing and unwinding. I knew I had to go to Roopkund and see it for myself!I asked the staff at the town’s only trekking shop in town about Roopkund. They didn’t know much about it firsthand, but they said the area was remote and dangerous to visit alone so I searched for a partner.I met a fiery young backpacker from Israel named Roy who was at the end of his adventure in India. He had just cashed his last traveler’s check. I told him about my plan to visit Roopkund and he wanted to go,  but he lacked money and gear.  I offered to pay for his food and transport cost and said he could sleep in my tent so he could save on having to pay for accommodations. That sealed the deal. We were on our way the next morning. We took a string of buses from Almora to the town of Gwaldam, asked for directions and we began our trek toward Roopkund.Beginning the TrekThe first night we pitched camp in a meadow next to some Tibetan horse herders, who smiled and made friendly gestures but only spoke Tibetan. We hiked and  hiked up a wide dirt path through a lush green valley to the village of Wan, where we were greeted by a group of Indian construction laborers who invited us to join their lunch of curry, rice and lentils. We continued past Wan through numerous,  picturesque little Himalayan settlements, groups of a few houses here and there, inhabited by traditional Hindu mountain people who farmed the land, raised animals and lived as they had for thousands of years —  without TV, cars or electricity.The second night we set up camp on a tiny green island between two shallow streams. When we got settled into our tent, we were greeted by a “Hello sir!” from a business-like 7-year-old boy who sold us some cordial concentrate for 100 rupees, which he had pressed from summer wildflowers. It was red, sweet and had a delicious floral taste.Caught in A HailstormThe next day we pushed up a lung-busting series of steep switchbacks through a tall rhododendron forest as gnarly thunderclouds growled and crackled all afternoon. We walked up and above the tree line, hugging a narrow trail next to sheer cliffs as huge, thick droplets of rain began to pelt down, each one striking our jackets and backpacks with an audible “splat.” We were stuck on a 5′ wide trail hugging a cliff, with nowhere to go for cover and nowhere flat enough to pitch a tent. So we ran as hard as we (safely) could on the slippery, rocky trail… up and up… our backpacks jangling around and the straps digging hard into our shoulders.The droplets turned to small painful blasts of hail and we kept running until we could see the huge rolling green pastures of Bedni Bugyal a few hundred yards in the distance. Starting to get soaked, we sprinted like hell for the nearest patch of high green ground and we rushed to pitch my tent. We fumbled and rushed and got the poles wrong, and then fixed it, clipped on in the fly.. ripped off our wet outer clothes and dived into the tent – shaking and chattering with cold and adrenaline – fumbling to get into our sleeping bags. It took us a good 30 minutes to fully calm down and catch our breath.The next day we arose to the sight of a beautiful rolling meadow, surrounded on 3 sides by 20,000+ foot white Himalayan peaks. While we relaxed that day, we went over our plan to climb up into the snow and visit Roopkund. We were stoked up with excitement, joking and bragging about what an amazing adventure we were on and the amazing stories of frozen skeletons we would be able to tell our friends after we got back home. We felt like we were on top of the world, or at least close to it. We were gonna “conquer” the mysterious death lake, Roopkund.Making the AscentWe set our watch alarm for 4:30 AM, and by headlamp, we walked high above the meadows and onto narrow tracks leading towards the snowline. I lost my footing and slipped ten feet down a steep gravel bank, uncomfortably close to a drop-off of several hundred feet. As I pulled myself back up and caught my breath, I soberly realized that we were 3 days walk from the nearest road and that we were really on our own.Tracking the Snow LeopardWe made it to a huge white snow bowl at the base of the upper Trishul peak, a place at 16,000 feet called Bagubassa. Roy called out, “Hey! someone has already been here this morning!” He pointed to a set of footprints in the snow leading at least a mile up a steep snowy ridge towards Roopkund. We walked to the edge of the snow and we were surprised not to see human footprints but rather, saw fat, cat’s paw-shaped tracks – the size of coconut shells. “Is it a tiger?” he asked. “No, it’s a snow leopard!” I said. There was no mistaking it: fresh snow leopard tracks. Leading in the direction of Roopkund. The feeling of excitement and intoxication being in a wild, remote place was intense.We followed the snow leopard’s tracks and I was amazed how it could trot through such a cold, steep and inhospitable environment. I was struggling to keep my balance. The snow leopard lives in the highest of places where the gods live: places where humans didn’t really belong.I began to realize that it was kind of foolish and arrogant to even be trying to “go there.”Roopkund Trek Difficulty LevelWe followed the tracks for a mile, and the snow got progressively deeper and thicker — up to our thighs. It took a massive effort to walk even a few meters. By 1 p.m. – we were still following the tracks and we were almost 8 miles from our camp. The ridge where Roopkund sat looked too high and plowed with waist-deep snow to get to during August (we later found out the snow melts in September).  And we knew that we had to turn back. We weren’t going to make Roopkund this year.Stuck in Snow BanksAs we started to go back, it started to get fiercely windy up there — making it difficult to keep our balance on the steep snow slopes. Loose snow started to blow hard and it made it difficult to see more than several meters ahead. My partner Roy didn’t have sunglasses, and loose snow was blowing into his eyes. The bright glare was blinding him.  I told him to follow right behind me – and even hold onto my jacket if he needed to. We veered off our original foot tracks and ended up digging ourselves out of several waist-deep snowbanks that exhausted us like quicksand. We got into arguments about which was the correct way back to our meadow camp. I had never felt so cold or uncomfortable in my entire life. I realized that this mountain could kill me, dead, within minutes.My ego was severely flattened. My sense of masculine conquest was dashed. I felt ashamed of my “teenage” obsession to see frozen skeletons. I realized that those skeletons in Roopkund were poor souls – people exactly like me and Roy – who happened to be in this same place at the wrong moment when the weather was worse. I realized that the mountains I loved to explore so much were beautiful but deadly and unforgiving places – and that each time I went into them,  I was taking a big risk. I realized that animals, like the snow leopard, were greater and far braver than foolish, gawking tourists like me. And I realized that if the wind got worse or more severe – and we got stuck or lost – our lives would be over,  reduced to a small blurb about 2 missing backpackers in the Indian newspaper. The end.After two hours of backtracking, we made it to the edge of the snow bowl, and we had to slide down a steep muddy bank to get to the trail back to our campsite. It soiled our clothes. We got back to camp in crawled into our sleeping bags, exhausted and unable to say much. We didn’t make it to Roopkund and didn’t get to take pictures of any old skeletons (the pictures above are from a friend who went in September)  – but we got a small taste of the experience of what must have happened to them.What This Adventure Taught MeAfter the Roopkund trek, the whole tone of the rest of my trip through India was changed. I felt a lot more humble and respectful of nature. I felt a shift in emphasis from trying to “conquer” destinations for the sake of cool pictures and stories to brag about, to gracefully entering places and experiencing things with more of a feeling of reverence.I’ll always thank the snow leopard and the Great Himalayas for teaching me this important life lesson.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/snaefellsnes-peninsula-iceland-miniature/,The Snaefellsnes Peninsula – Iceland in Miniature,Iceland,"Located a couple of hours north of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, lies the Snaefellsnes Peninsula. Often referred to as ‘Iceland in Miniature’, this makes a great side trip for those travelers unable to take a week and drive the full Ring Road around the island.The Beauty of the SnaefellsnesA drive around the peninsula can be done in a long day trip from Reykjavik, which is made even more possible by the long hours of daylight during late spring and summer. For most people, a slower two-day itinerary offers a more casual pace when exploring all this diverse land has to offer.Monument at Borg a MyrumOn a two day itinerary, the small town of Borgarnes is a great place to stop for the night after leaving Reykjavik and before heading north to the Snaefellsnes. Borgarnes is an easy 70-kilometer drive from Reykjavik and takes roughly an hour. The main sight in Borgarnes is the excellent Settlement Museum, which chronicles the peopling of Iceland, as well as delving into the Icelandic Sagas, the folklore held so dearly by the Icelandic people.Just north of Borganes is another site of historical importance to Icelanders, the farm at Borg á Mýrum. One of the country’s first settlers, Skallagrímur Kveldúlfsson, established his farm here in the mid-900s AD. The site now contains a small church and a sculpture memorializing the loss of Kveldúlfsson’s two grandsons to the harsh conditions of the new land.Stykkishólmur HarbourA little more than an hour’s drive to the north side of the peninsula is the town of Stykkishólmur, a picturesque fishing village that is the largest town on the peninsula at under 1,200 inhabitants. It’s a good place to stock up on supplies and find lodging before exploring the peninsula if one chooses the multi-day route. Stykkishólmur’s natural harbor is capped by Súgandisey, a large basalt island capped by a lighthouse that affords views over the town to the south and the bay of Breiðafjörður and the Westfjords to the north.On top of HelgafellA couple of kilometers south of Stykkishólmur is the holy mountain of Helgafell. The 240-meter mountain is reported to be the site where one of the heroines of the Icelandic Sagas last lived and is buried, and legend says that three wishes will be granted to anyone who climbs the mountain without speaking or looking back, and faces east while making the wishes. The hike to the top is an easy 15-minute climb.Inside the Bjarnhofn Shark MuseumHakarl hanging in the barnProbably the peninsula’s top sight, other than its scenic beauty, is the nearby Bjarnarhofn Shark Museum. This small museum contains a collection of stuffed wildlife, fishing implements and other paraphernalia highlighting the struggle the people have in living in such an inhospitable climate much of the year. The highlight of the museum is learning the story of authentically Icelandic food, Hákarl, which translates to fermented shark.As the meat of the Greenland shark is poisonous when consumed fresh, the meat is allowed to ferment in the ground for a couple of months before being hung in a barn on the site, then processed and consumed. Hákarl has become fairly well-known after being featured on a number of television shows know for extreme eating, and it’s strong odor and unique taste make it difficult for foreigners to enjoy. That said, trying it makes for a great story, and the Bjarnhofn offers visitors the opportunity to see the meat hanging in the barn as well as try a small sample of it with rye bread.GrundarfjörðurKirkjufellHeading eastward from Stykkishólmur, the peninsula becomes both more beautiful and more rugged. There are a number of small towns along the way, all under 500 inhabitants, including Grundarfjörður, Ólafsvík, Hellnar, and Arnarstapi. There are also a few sights. Near the town of Grundarfjörður is another prominent mountain, the conical Kirkjufell. With a scenic waterfall nearby, it is one of the peninsula’s most popular photographic stops.SnæfellsjökullThe far eastern end of the peninsula is capped by rugged lava fields from Snæfellsjökull, the landscape-dominating volcano that was featured in Jules Verne’s Journey to the Center of the Earth. There are many tour operators that offer 4WD excursions to the top of the mountains and well as the more inaccessible parts of Snæfellsjökull National Park.The Church at HellnarMonument to BardurThe drive along the southern part of the peninsula is also scenic but offers less in the way of sights to visit. One exception to that is the church at Hellnar and the Monument to Bardur, the patron saint of the glacier, who was said to have the gift of being able to communicate with the hidden people, another one of Iceland’s many legends. The cliffs near Hellnar and Arnarstapi are also good spots for birding.Peninsula roads in AprilFrom Arnarstapi, it is an easy hour and a half drive back to Borgarnes, and another hour after that back to Reykjavik. The main roads around the Snaefellsnes, State Routes 54 and 574 are both sealed and in good condition, however many of the side roads are unpaved and can be difficult in bad weather. Like the rest of the island, the North Atlantic jet stream causes many rainy & snowy days, but the peninsula can still be enjoyed on those days, albeit slower and more carefully.There are tours of the Snaefellsnes that can be booked from Reykjavik, but renting a car and tackling this magical part of the country is both easy and preferred.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/5-great-road-trips-2/,11 Great Road Trips,Iceland,"I asked some of my travel blogger colleagues for their suggestions on great road trips and received these excellent ideas:Christina Saull (@MiddleSeatView) from myviewfromthemiddleseat.com Coastal MaineU.S. Route 1 stretches the length of the east coast more than 2,300 miles. A particularly beautiful stretch of this road runs along the rocky coast of Maine. A coastal Maine road trip from Kennebunkport to Bar Harbor takes significantly longer on Route 1 than it does on the Interstate, but the lobster shacks, rugged coastline, farmers markets, lighthouses, and a wide assortment of oddities you’ll pass along the way make it a road trip worth taking.Chris: Christina has a great suggestion here. My wife and I honeymooned in Maine at Acadia National Park and I have a great fondness for this part of the country and its beautiful scenery. Lance & Laura (@TravelerAddicts ) from traveladdicts.net Iceland’s Ring Road  Iceland’s Ring Road (Route 1) is perhaps the world’s ultimate road trip. Since completion in 1974, this 1,332 kilometers (830 miles) route hugs rocky shorelines, crosses mountain passes and takes you to places like the glacier lagoon of Jökulsárlón, which are unique. In addition to Jökulsárlón, the region around Lake Myvatn is a highlight of the Ring Road and features boiling mud pits, volcano calderas and hot springs to relax. In the evenings, grab dinner at a gas station with locals and then take a room at a farm for the night. We’d recommend no less than seven days for an Iceland itinerary to drive the Ring Road and the Golden Circle, plus an extra day or two in Reykjavik.Chris: This road trip is on my personal list and has been since Dave Grenewetzki talked about it on Travel to Iceland – Amateur Traveler Episode 204. I may be going to Iceland for the first time in September, so this may be the year for me to experience this great trip.Bianca Bauza @nomadbiba from nomadbiba.com Crossing Canada A while ago, I did one of the most epic road trips of my travels as my boyfriend at the time and I crossed Canada from Squamish, British Columbia to Montreal, Quebec in our van. This odyssey took a few days. The most interesting part of the trip was when we were in British Columbia and Alberta, the landscapes there are just magnificent! But as we left the Canadian Rockies behind the landscape becomes really flat, with not one hill for miles and miles and miles on end. When we finally made it to Ontario, we were greeted by the gorgeous changing colors of the fall. It was an unforgettable experience.I did a photo essay on my blog, in case you’d want to have a look.Chris: I have driven the western portion of that trip from British Columbia into Alberta and it has some of the most beautiful scenery I have seen. I would love to explore some of the flat parts in the middle, and the small towns along the way.Carole Terwilliger Meyers @traveluv from travelswithcarole.blogspot.com Eastern Sierras I once took a fabulous road trip from the San Francisco Bay Area to Las Vegas. We went through Yosemite’s high country Tioga Pass, which is only open in summer because of heavy snowfall, and spent the night near mysterious Mono Lake (shown in the picture). Then we drove along desolate inland Highway 398, stopping at the Manzanar National Historic Site where 10,000 Japanese Americans were detained during World War II, and on to Death Valley, where we spent another night. Las Vegas was just a hop, skip, and jump the next day.Chris: What a great road trip. We first talked about it on Amateur Traveler with Doug McConnell in Travel to the Eastern Slope of the Sierra Nevada Mountains – Amateur Traveler Episode 178 and I just revisited the area last Fall. It was my first visit to Manzanar. The one thing I would add is the ghost town of Bodie, a California State Park. Bodie is an old mining ghost town and one of my favorite spots to visit as a photographer. Chris Christensen @chris2x from AmateurTraveler.com California Route 1 U.S. Route 1 on the west coast is also spectacular. I recommend in particular the stretch from Monterey and Carmel down to Moro Bay. Spend a few days exploring Monterey, Pacific Grove, and Carmel then grab a picnic lunch and head down the coast to Big Sur. Explore the beach at Andrew Molera State Beach and take a hike to a waterfall in the redwoods at Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. Continue on down to San Simeon to see Hearst Castle the opulent estate of media magnate William Randolph Hearst. Explore the pretty town of Cambria and then cut back inland at Moro Rock. The drive itself will take a day but plan on half a day for San Simeon and at least 2-3 days for the Monterey Area.Kellie Netherwood (@DestnUnknown) from mydestinationunknown.comWestern Australia: Coast & Outback Nature’s Window, Kalbarri Gorge, Western AustraliaIf Western Australia were a country, it would be the tenth-largest in the world. Its size and diversity make it an ideal road trip destination for both those with time on their hands or those after an adventure that fits into a shorter time frame. A two-week itinerary I recently enjoyed begins and ends in Perth and captures the essence of Australia’s largest state in under 5,000 km and two weeks on the road.It provides the perfect contrast between coast and outback, beginning along the dramatic west coast, turning inland towards Karijini National Park and returning to Perth through characteristic outback towns. It showcases the state’s diversity with dramatic sunrise and sunsets, hiking opportunities, contrasting and constantly changing landscapes and swimming and snorkeling opportunities. Karijini is the main attraction, possessing all the characteristics of the iconic Australian outback: unsealed and dusty roads, gum trees reaching to the skies, spinifex carpeting the red soil, kangaroos hopping across the landscape, night skies filled with stars or lightning displays and deafening but therapeutic silence. Dick Jordan (@eriksmithdotcom) from onmyfeetorinmymind.com/New Zealand’s South Island New Zealand SunsetYou can’t go anywhere fast while road tripping on New Zealand’s South Island, and the reason isn’t the condition of the roads. A rough circle of the South Island runs a little over 2,300 km, but the possibilities of drifting off that route and finding so much surreal beauty that filmmakers have often used this as a setting for fictional lands. Fortunately, it is a real country with gorgeous mountains, sheltered coves, countless hiking possibilities, friendly little towns, and more adventure sports than one thought possible. The southeast corner of the island holds the still undiscovered beauty of The Catlins, with its lighthouses and waterfalls, and the southwestern corner features the famous Milford Sound Road. Up in the north, near Nelson and Blenheim, is the heart of New Zealand’s world-famous wine industry. So much of the drive is close to the ocean, offering sunrises and sunsets over the ocean. While sparsely populated, a rebuilding Christchurch and underrated Dunedin offer plenty for the urban dwellers. The real pleasure of the island is the ability to follow just about any road and find unspeakable, unspoiled beauty, and plenty of friendly and welcoming faces when you return to civilization.Chris: The North Island isn’t too shabby either.Dick Jordan (@talestold) from talestoldfromtheroad.comCanadian Rocky Mountains Pyramid Mountain“Get off the road.”“Just get off “The Damned Road.”That’s why “The Cowboy” said I should do.I would have gotten an entirely different perspective on the Canadian Rocky Mountains if I had ditched my rental car, climbed on a horse, and followed him into the backcountry.But if “The Damned Road” didn’t exist, I would have never met “The Cowboy,” nor would I have been able to easily reach that section of the mountainous spine that runs north from New Mexico to British Columbia.And I did get out from behind the wheel, now and again, to let my legs take me to where the scenery was even more spectacular than that visible through the windshield.Chris: This is definitely one of my favorite routes. I have driven all or part of the road from Banff to Jasper 3 times and it never gets old.Andrea (@destinationeu) from rearviewmirror.tvNorthern Germany Berlin’s Brandenburg GateThere are countless options for road trips around Germany. You can do a self-drive tour of Germany’s famous castles or drive the Romantic Road but one of my favorite trips is a road trip across Northern Germany which takes you from Cologne to Berlin past World Heritage-listed sites (Cologne Cathedral,Town Hall and Roland on the Marketplace of Bremen, Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin), Hanseatic cities, hipster neighborhoods and great shopping boulevards. The route you take will depend on your travel style but there are some amazing cities to stop at along the way before finishing in dynamic Berlin. I suggest an itinerary for driving in Northern Germany that includes Cologne, Dusseldorf, Muenster, Osnabrueck, Bremen, Hamburg, Rostock, Warnemuende, Potsdam, and Berlin.Chris: I have not driven this all as one trip but have been to most of these cities over the course of 4 trips. See the Cathedral in Cologne, take in Carnival in Dusseldorf, check out the statue of The Bremen Town Musicians, visit the palace of Frederick the Great in Potsdam. All great stops.Catherine (@TheGoFever) from thegofever.comUS Route 1 in Florida Florida KeysDriving down US Route 1 from Miami through the Florida Keys is a breathtaking experience. With bikers in tow, you’ll first pass through Key Largo, then Islamorada and the mile markers will keep descending until you’ve reached the cool and very crazy home of mile marker 0: tropical Key West.Dividing the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico, the road passes through tiny villages, shell shacks, and countless snorkeling opportunities, until reaching Seven Mile Bridge, an engineering marvel where you’ll most likely feel like you’re driving on the ocean itself. The abandoned old bridge, now in ruins, is an eerily impressive sight and makes for an even more memorable drive.The route takes about 3 hours 1/2, but who’s in a rush? Be sure to stop by a seafood joint to munch on conch fritters, and embrace the kitsch and laid-back vibe of this one-of-a-kind part of America. Chris Chirstensen (@chris2x) from AmateurTraveler.comBlue Ridge Parkway Black Balsam Knob in autumnIt is billed as “America’s Favorite Drive” and more than one of you said we should have included it in our list of great road trips. It was built during the Great Depression to help the Appalachian region through tourism dollars. The Blue Ridge Parkway meanders for almost 500 miles through North Carolina and Virginia along the crest of the Blue Ridge Mountains. This is a road for savoring, not for making time. Stop at the vista points as often as you can to enjoy the rolling hills. What can you call a National Park that was intended to be enjoyed from the road but quintessentially American?  Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/our-travels-karl-anders-traveled-to-iceland/,Our Travels – Karl Anders Traveled to Iceland,Iceland,"Two years ago when Amateur Traveler had an episode on Iceland. Iceland had long been on my bucket list — stories of Vikings, rugged shores and volcanoes had been on and off my radar since I was a child. When I listened Episode 204, with guest Dave, I was inspired to learn more. Doing the usual research I do before a trip (some on-line, some with library books, always with at least one good travel guide in hand) Iceland soon moved to the top of my travel list. Within a few months I had booked a week’s travel in Iceland.My brother and I take one week each year to travel together, time we consider sacred as it keeps us in touch and deeply connected. In 2010, this journey to Iceland was our joint trip together. And it was such a great adventure to share!Getting to Iceland is easy, with several major airlines flying there from North America. We flew on Icelandair, the national carrier, an adequate if not inspiring flight. But the red-eye flight’s arrival in Iceland soon found us wide awake as we picked up our car rental and headed into the countryside. There were many surprises on the trip and these started the moment we left the airport. I had not counted on just how rugged and raw the country was — seeming freshly poured of a volcanic mold not unlike the Big Island of Hawaii. I didn’t expect it to be so green. I didn’t expect it to be treeless (it was deforested within a few centuries by very cold Vikings for fuel and shelter). I didn’t expect to see so many glaciers (about 10% of the country is covered in an ice cap). I didn’t expect to see so many Icelandic horses, nor did I expect them to be so short and handsome. Simply stated, I didn’t expect Iceland to be so beautiful.So despite reasonably detailed research, including Chris’ fine podcast, Iceland was a pleasant surprise. The capitol, Reykjavik, is a beautiful and colorful modern city with a lovely harbor setting. Almost two thirds of the island’s 300,000 population lives here. The rest of the island is sparsely developed and not very populated and it’s very easy to get around. There are times when on a hike where you won’t run into anyone for hours — I like that. We drove the ring road, stopping at most major highlights, and saw and did a lot. It would have been nice to have had a few more days, but we were satisfied with our visit. I’m planning on heading back soon.My biggest surprise was at just how rugged and pristine the land is. I love waterfalls and the island has no shortage of magnificent waterfalls. I was pleasantly surprised by the rift valley at Thingevillir, a World Heritage Site. The valley is fairly narrow and it seems to be almost be ripping apart in front of you. I was also surprised by how many rainbows we saw. The weather changes frequently, with showers blowing by commonly; these are often accompanied by rainbows; these rainbows were magical and I could enjoy them as a child would have!Chris asked me to share my best tip for travel to Iceland. I guess it would be just to go and not be intimidated. Iceland is very easy to navigate and everyone (EVERYONE) speaks English!. If you can, travel during the shoulder seasons (May, Sept) to take advantage of lower rates for hotels and car rentals. Also, be sure you go outside on a clear night and look north. You’ll likely be rewarded with a view of the northern lights (as we were), although it’s not something you’ll see if you’re there in summer because it, too, is the land of the midnight sun (with almost no dark during the June solstice).There are many things unique about Iceland, but none more so than the putrified shark meat (buried for more than 6 months) they pride themselves in eating. I couldn’t stomach the stuff but perhaps you’re more man than me and can get it down. In direct contrast, the meal of roast reindeer in a blueberry sauce was also unique and one of the tastiest I’ve ever eaten anywhere.Thank you, Chris, for all you do to get us Amateurs out there traveling.For more about Iceland read Karl’s Iceland Travel Blog.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-venice-in-2-days/,Things to do in Venice in 2 days,Italy,"Floating atop a vast expanse of gleaming blue waters, there is no other city in the world that sparks the kind of wonder and joy that Venice can. It is arguably one of the most romantic and picturesque cities in the world. Venice is one of the hottest tourist spots in all of Italy. What makes the Queen of the Adriatic unique is the iconic network of waterways and bridges that connect and divide the city.Venice is small and tightly packed which makes it ideal for being able to experience most of Venice in only a few days. If planned well, 2 days in Venice may be all the time you need to capture the essence of the city. To help you successfully accomplish this, I have created an itinerary for things to do in 2 days in Venice.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Venice’s Marco Polo Airport to VeniceGetting to the water transport piersDAY 1St. Mark’s SquareRialto Bridge & MarketSunset in VeniceDAY 2Drop the map and explore the cityMurano, Burano, TorcelloOther things to seeGetting to Murano, Burano, and Torcello from VeniceVenice’s Marco Polo Airport to VeniceThere are three ways to get to Venice from Marco Polo Airport. To get to Piazza San Marco where we start the trip, use one of the following three modes of transport:The (ACTV Line #5) bus line leaves you at the Piazzale Roma for about €8. From here, you can catch the vaporetto, or water bus, one way for another €8 and take it right down the grand canal. This is the least convenient mode of transport for the walking required, especially if you have a large party or have many bags.The Alilaguna, or water ferry, is another option. A one-way ticket will run you €15, but you can save yourself €1 if you purchase ahead of time online. Take either the Blu (Blue) or Arancia (Orange) lines to get from the airport to the San Marco stop. The trip from start to finish takes anywhere between 75-90 minutes. Unfortunately, the ferryboats are slow and in rough shape. They are often crowded and the seats are not comfortable. It can be difficult to see through the oft foggy and dirty windows, as well. Consequently, this can result in a less than enjoyable ride and valuable time lost.The third and best option is to go by water taxi. It is the costliest of the three options, but make no mistake; it is like having a luxury car that will take you to the point nearest to your desired destination. It is by far the simplest and quickest way to get to the island center, with a trip length lasting anywhere between 20-40 minutes. A one-way water taxi trip can cost anywhere from €115 – €150 depending on your destination, but the fare is flat. If you are traveling with a group you can split the cost of the trip, so for a little more than the cost of the ferry ticket per person, you can get a comfortable, private luxury ride. If you are traveling solo, see if there are any other people willing to split the cost and share a ride.The views you see as you approach the island by water taxi are unlike anything you would get with any of the aforementioned options. You will have a speedboat furnished with comfortable seating inside the cabin, or you have the option of stand in the open air towards the rear of the boat. When standing, you get an unobstructed 360-degree view throughout the duration of the trip of the entire lagoon and islands. The real treat will be when you begin winding through the canals and you get to see Venice from the “water streets.” This experience makes the water taxi well worth the price of admission.Getting to the water transport piersUpon leaving the baggage claim area, look for the “public transport tickets” counters where you can buy tickets to the ACTV land bus and the Alilaguna “water bus” lines. If you are taking a water taxi, find the ticket window labeled “Speed Boat to Venice.” Once you have gotten your tickets for your chosen mode of transport, follow the blue signs that say “Trasporti via acqua – Water transport.”It is about a 10-minute walk from the arrivals area to the Alilaguna boat dock and water taxi piers. The sign markers along the way conveniently tell you how much time it will take for you to reach the piers. When you arrive at lagoon level, you will see a landing flanked by numbered piers.You can buy your ticket ahead of time through the Consorzio Motoscafi Venezia website. If you do not already have your taxi reserved when you arrive, you will have another ticket window where you could hire a water taxi on the spot. However, I recommend reserving your water taxi ahead of time as the fare will be slightly more expensive should you wait to hire one last minute due to demand and availability. Take your previously printed voucher or the one the attendant will hand you to your assigned pier where your water taxi will be waiting for you.DAY 1With only 2 days in Venice, we’ll start your trip off straight away by visiting some of the major sights on every visitor’s “must-see” list.St. Mark’s SquareFirst up will be St. Mark’s Square (Piazza San Marco). From here, you will be able to tour St. Mark’s Basilica (Basilica Di San Marco), the Bell Tower of St. Marks’s Church (Campanile di San Marco) and the Doge’s Palace.If you are into photography, I highly suggest arriving early in the morning, between 6 am and 7 am, to capture the sunrise over the square. The early morning light from the sun creeping onto the virtually empty square is a breathtaking, serene scene.If not, plan on arriving before 10 am to save yourself from having to wait in long lines at the Basilica, This 11th-century church has a beautiful Gothic design with striking goal mosaics on both the inside and out. During the busy months from 1 April to 1 November, I would highly recommend buying the skip the line ticket for only €3 or a skip the line guided tour as the entrance lines can get quite long when a cruise ship is in port.Head on over next door to the Doge’s Palace. The Doge was the historic ruler of Venice. A Doge was elected for life by the ruling elite. If you want to see inside the palace, try the Secret Itineraries tour. The last tour starts at 11:35 am and will run you €25.40. On this 90-minute long tour, you will get an exclusive look-in the archives and prisons from the times of the Venetian Republic. These tickets can fill up so you should look into them weeks in advance.If you have managed to make good time, I recommend taking a trip up to the top of the Bell Tower of St. Mark’s Church. The bell tower stands tall at 323 ft. with an observation deck with sweeping views of the islands that comprise Venice. The cost of admission to the top of the bell tower is €8, but you can buy a skip-the-line ticket online for €13.Rialto Bridge & MarketTake a quick 7-minute walk to get from St. Mark’s Square to the Rialto Bridge. Enjoy the experience as you wind through the labyrinth of narrow alleys and small canal crossings. The Rialto Bridge is a spectacular sight. It is the oldest bridge in Venice. It was originally built in 1181 as a pontoon bridge. The current stone version of the bridge has been standing since 1591.If you can make it during operating hours, take some time to explore the sprawling Rialto Market where you will find a selection of fresh produce and a wide variety of fresh fish. Close your eyes and let the smells of fresh seafood, vegetables, and fruits waft over you. You will hear the chorus of local fishmongers and produce vendors chatting it up with the locals selling their fresh haul. Allow yourself to submit to the full sensory experience occurring before you. The operating hours of the markets are:Pescheria (Fish Market) Open: Tuesday – Saturday from 7:30 am – 1 pm.Produce Market Open: Monday – Saturday from 7:30 am – 1 pm.Now make your way to the T Fondaco dei Tedeschi mall nearby and visit their Rooftop Terrace. The cost to access the terrace is free, but you are required to go to their website and reserve a time slot ahead of time. The normal operating times are from 10:15 to 7:15 or later, depending on the season.Sunset in VeniceSpend the evening doing the classic tourist activity when in Venice – take a gondola ride over the Venetian waters and let all of your worries go as you watch the last of the sunlight reflect from and then drown in the blue waters. The beauty of the sun setting over the Grand Canal is beyond any combination of words I can put together.DAY 2With many of the major sights out of the way, start your day off by simply taking to the streets and see if you fall in love with them (spoiler alert: I can guarantee that you will). The city of Venice hides its most stunning secrets within its lanes that you will only discover as you wander around aimlessly, taking in everything it has to offer. So set off on foot early in the morning and snap away as the city awakens.Drop the map and explore the cityTake some time to explore the little shops and boutiques that line the streets of Venice as each holds a unique aspect of the culture and legacy of this historic city. Make sure you visit Muranero di Niang Moulaye in particular, a jewelry and glass boutique where Moulaye, an expert glass artist, will perform glass blowing in front of you and give you the opportunity to grab the perfect Italian souvenir blending Murano glass with African style.Murano, Burano, TorcelloSpend the remainder of your second day in this dreamy city exploring what is arguably the most awe-inspiring and striking part of Venice – the Murano, Burano, and Torcello islands in the Venetian lagoon.Murano is world-renowned for its glass artisans. Here you can catch a glass master blowing and shaping melted glass into works of art.Burano is instantly recognizable by the vibrant, multicolored building facades hugging small canals. It is a nice escape. Stop by the winery resort Venissa, where you can walk through the picturesque vineyard and outdoor sculpture garden.Torcello is where Venice originally began before moving to the island we know today. What was once the center of Venetian trade and politics, with only a handful of permanent residents remaining; Torcello has become a quiet, peaceful island that feels a world away from civilization.Start in the morning so that you have ample time to truly take in the individual beauty of each of the three islands and then take a boat ride back as the sun sets in the water. The scene will surely make for some Instagram worthy shots.When you return to the Venetian island, you can opt for one of the many sightseeing tours that go around every day on the islands, each allowing you to explore a different feature of the Venetian islands.Other things to seeIf island hopping does not interest you, then you can opt to lounge around and have a relaxing beach day. Stop and visit Lido where you can walk on the skirts of the sparkling Lido Beach.If you are interested in modern art, then there is no better place to visit than the Peggy Guggenheim Museum. Embellished with 20th century works from the likes of Picasso, Miro, and Dali among others, the Guggenheim museum is quite literally a remarkable sight.How to Get to Murano, Burano, and Torcello from VeniceThe Alilaguna is how you will get between Murano, Burano, and Torcello and it is easiest from San Marco – San Zaccaria stop located by St. Mark’s Square. A one-way ticket is about €7.50, which you can buy from the ticket window or through the automated ticket kiosks. The best option may be to buy the unlimited ride day passes for a 1-day pass for €20 or a 2-day pass for €30.Whichever ticket type you choose, remember to validate your ticket using the ticket readers at the dock before getting on the boat.If you want to visit Murano, take the #12 line to the “Murano Faro” stop and then catch the #12 again to visit Burano. If you want to visit Torcello, you will need to take the #9 or #12 line one stop to Torcello.Alternatively, if you want to skip Murano altogether, you can take the #14 line which will take you all the way to Burano without needing to change ferry lines. You will take the #14 line to the Lido stop if you want to visit Lido Beach.Venice is a wonder all by itself. Ideally, you would want more than 2 days in Venice to be able to experience all that Venice has to offer. However, if 2 days is all that is available, then this guide will get you to see as much of the city in a short amount of time.This post is sponsored by Consorzio Motoscafi Venezia but all opinions are that of the author… or the editor.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,Italy,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/sailing-the-amalfi-coast/,Sailing the Amalfi Coast,Italy,"The town of Sorrento and the rest of the Amalfi Coast is full of beauty, and while exploring it all by a vehicle on land can be quite breathtaking, there is no better way to see it all then by boat.  After all, no one can possibly resist the glimmer of the sun as it begins to rise over the massive cliffs or how that same sun seems to glow over the villages as it is lowering itself in the evening’s sky.Anyone that has never spent time out on the water of the Mediterranean Sea near this area of the world will want to place it up at the top of their must-see vacation destinations.  Climbing aboard a boat or a yacht and sailing from one area of the coast to another over a week or a month will create a memorable vacation that everyone will remember forever.The best way to visit Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast is by the sea, you can hire a Yacht from Capri, Sorrento, Naples or the Amalfi Coast.Things to Do While Visiting  Sorrento and the Amalfi CoastMornings will be spent climbing up to the decks to look out over the water and breath in the fresh salty air.  A lucky few will see the native marine life as it reaches the surface of the sea, while others will simply grab their beach towel before hopping into the water for an early morning swim.  The rest of the morning will involve eating delectable breakfast foods and drinking coffee or another beverage while finalizing the unique itinerary of the day.Every day will bring something new, and people can choose to spend their entire day on their boat or yacht, or they can sail to one of the nearby ports along the shoreline.  Once everyone reaches the port of their choice, they can stroll through the towns and villages, dine at a local restaurant, shop at the boutiques, and even spend time with the locals.Spectacular Villages of the Amalfi CoastThere are quite a few villages along the Amalfi Coast, so many in fact that it can be very difficult for travelers to choose which ones they want to see the most.  Most of the villages have been constructed on the sides of the cliffs, making for picturesque settings.  As visitors are sailing up toward the village that they are visiting that day, they will want to drop the anchor to their boat and simply stare at what is in front of them in amazement.AmalfiOf course, no one will spend too much time staring at the villages, because they will want to step foot inside them to experience them all firsthand.  While everyone will have their favorites, the village of Amalfi should be on every visitor’s list.  This bustling village has long been known as one of the Maritime Republics in the country and it is full of history.  Travelers can learn about how to make the handcrafted paper that this Italian village is famous for while listening to all the legends that have been passed down through the generations.  No one will want to venture back to their boat, after a long day in Amalfi, without making at least one stop for the delicious limoncello that seems to be available everywhere.AtraniAtrani is another village that many people enjoy visiting, but since it is so small in size, many travelers skip it completely without giving it a second thought.  While no one could spend an entire day in Atrani, there are plenty of places where visitors can snap photographs of spectacular views that cannot be seen anywhere else in the world and that is why everyone will want to give it a chance.PositanoPositano is the most popular destination on the Amalfi Coast, and as everyone is sailing up to it, they will be amazed at how many steps appear to be everywhere within the village.  From the water, the pinks, yellows, and whites of the Mediterranean houses will not look as bright as they will when the boat arrives at the shore. While strolling through this village, visitors will climb hundreds of stairs as they wander through the steep alleys and streets.Delicious CuisineMany of the ports that everyone goes to (Nerano, Marina di Puolo, Positano, Conca del Sogno) are full of seaside restaurants, which makes it easy for everyone to climb off their boat and walk right up to a table.  Fresh fish and seafood are on the menu of each one and no one will be able to tear their eyes away from the spectacular views of the sea to look at the menu to order anything but one of the fresh catches of the day.  Every meal will need to have a glass of cold white wine included, although a glass of red can be ordered if that is what a person prefers.Magnificent Beaches and Phenomenal ViewsBoth the Amalfi Coast and the town of Sorrento have magnificent beaches, but some of them are only accessible by boat. Those are the beaches that travelers on sailing adventures will want to stop at, because they will not be as crowded, and they can be quite magical too.  Marmorata has a rushing waterfall as well as a wonderful lagoon for swimming.In Positano, there is Laurito and Arienzo that are better to reach by boat as there are a lot of stairs if you wish to arrive there by land.Tordigliano beach is one of the largest beaches on the coast with a length of only 350m (1150 feet). It is a real corner of paradise.ConclusionAs boats and yachts are sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, the people on board will find themselves facing picturesque panoramic views for miles in every direction.  One of the most spectacular sights is Mt. Vesuvius and boats can be seen passing it every time they sail to and from Capri.  Everyone will want to have their cameras or smartphones ready so that they can capture all the fabulous sights that they can.Vacations in Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast are phenomenal, especially during the evenings when travelers are back on their boats or yachts relaxing. Everyone can enjoy a drink and a bite to eat while watching the sunset over the Mediterranean Sea and many people may even choose to sleep out on the deck on some nights, as the stars twinkle high above in the dark sky.There is nothing more breathtaking than spending time out on the Mediterranean Sea while exploring the sights of Sorrento and the rest of the Amalfi Coast.  Once everyone experiences it for the first time, they will want to return again, if they ever manage to leave.Teresa writes for Sorrento Holiday Charter who offer charter leisure crafts fully authorized and insured, manned by a professional crew. All the staff speaks English, which makes the booking process much easier: https://sorrentoholidaycharter.com/contacts/Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/top-10-things-to-do-when-in-rome-italy/,"Top 10 Things to Do When in Rome, Italy",Italy,"One of the oldest cities in the world, Rome, has once been a center of culture, power, and politics. Its history dates back to over 2500 years. The city is associated with mythologies and legends, offering a unique mix of ancient and modern culture. Consequently, there are so many things to do in Rome, that you will have to make some hard choices.Several Roman emperors have ruled this majestic city and left behind impressive landmarks to commemorate their legacy.Over time, these sites have turned into famous tourist spots. The eternal city of Rome is renowned for its ancient relics and timeless architecture. Religious buildings, monuments, and palaces make Rome one of the top European destinations.When in Rome… don’t forget to do these 10 thingsAlthough there are several amazing things to do in Rome, these 10 things are must-do.1. Admire the ancient beauty of the ColosseumNot sure where to start off your Roman tour? How about the universally recognized symbol of Rome – the Colosseum. The place boasts a rich, and might we say ‘bloody’ history. Being the greatest amphitheater of the Roman Empire, the Colosseum used to host animal fights and gladiator combats.Around 4 million people visit the Colosseum annually. To make the best of your trip, buy your tickets beforehand, or you’ll have to wait in line. Better yet, get a combined ticket for the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and Palatine Hill, and skip the long ticket lines. Or take a VIP tour of the Colosseum that will give you access to the underground levels and the top level.2. Toss a coin in the Trevi FountainAccording to legend, throwing a coin in the fountain will bring you back to Rome. But you don’t have to visit it only to make a wish. Its stunning Baroque beauty is enough to make you want to stop and stare. With an awe-inspiring center statue of Neptune surrounded by tritons, the Trevi fountain is a marvel of architecture.Unfortunately, the fountain is overcrowded with street hawkers selling souvenirs and tourists almost the entire day. So to admire the fountain in its full glory, visit early in the morning or late at night, and you just might find it crowd-free.3. Explore the history in the Roman ForumThe Roman Forum was the center for political, religious and commercial activity in Rome and dates back to 500 B.C. It includes the Senate building, the Rostra where Marc Antony delivered his eulogy for Julius Caesar, the Arch of Titus, the Temple of Vesta (where you would have found the Vestal Virgins) and a number of other civic buildings and temples.At this archaeological site, you can almost picture the people of ancient Rome strolling down the cobblestoned streets in their togas.When visiting the site, it’s recommended to hire a guide as the ruins inside the forum have few signs. Plus, a guide can add to your knowledge of history and bring the place to life.4. Shop till you drop at the Galleria Alberto SordiRome is famous for its ancient places, but do you know there’s an old market where you can shop for modern design dresses and contemporary accessories? Galleria Alberto Sordi is that place.The Galleria dates back to 1922 and is considered as one of Europe’s most elegant places to shop. Adorned with mosaic floors and stained-glass ceilings, the Galleria has everything ranging from designer-wear and cosmetics to books and food.Some of the famous stores present in the Galleria include Zara, Italian bookstore La Feltrinelli, La Rinascente (Italy’s Macy’s), and Massimo Dutti.5. Absorb the Panoramic Views at GianicoloGianicolo is the highest vantage point that gives you a grand panoramic view of Rome. A long winding road takes you to the top. If you don’t prefer hiking, take a ride on a Vespa or in a car. From the top, you can view the amazing Roman monuments, including the Palazzo Venezia, the Spanish Steps, and more.At dusk, the place is crowded with Roman lovers and street hawkers. So if you want to enjoy the place with minimum commotion, visit it early in the day.6. Visit St. Peter’s BasilicaIt may be a holy site for Catholics, but you don’t have to be Roman Catholic to admire the artistic marvels of St. Peter’s Basilica. The original basilica was reputedly built over the tomb of St. Peter by Constantine in 349 A.D. Later, the church was demolished, and in 1626, the current one was created in its place. Now, St. Peter’s Basilica is the world’s largest church, spanning over 240,000 square feet.Inside this historic marvel you’ll find Michelangelo’s ‘Pieta,’’, and Bernini’s magnificent altarpiece ‘Baldachin’ and ‘the chair of Saint Peter’ among many other masterpieces.St. Peter’s is in Vatican City which is its own country within the city of Rome.  If you want to visit the Vatican Museum or the famed Sistine Chapel get there early or better yet, get a skip the line ticket.  For more information check out a guide to visiting the Vatican.7. See modern art at MAXXIIn the midst of all the ancient beauty, this modern art museum has a unique place of its own. It holds the honor of being the first national art museum of contemporary art.The architecture of the building itself is strikingly beautiful, with big open spaces, concrete ceilings covered with glass and staircases that seem to come out of nowhere. The museum hosts art exhibitions and activities all year round.8. Climb the Spanish StepsAlmost every movie set in Rome has a scene shot at this spot. Nothing describes its magnificence better than that.Climb these famous renowned steps, head over to the Trinita Dei Monti church, and appreciate Bernini’s ship-shaped fountain and the piazza. If you climb further, you’ll come across Villa Medici that gives you picturesque views of the Centro Storico.Off to the side of the Spanish Steps, you’ll find one of Rome’s under-the-radar museums, the Keats-Shelley Memorial House.9. Take a walk on the streets of TrastevereIf you want to take a break from the city culture and want to experience the Roman spirit, then visit the Trastevere neighborhood. It has cobbled streets and is lined with cafes and restaurants that serve cheap but delicious food.Walk down the streets that are mostly car-free. Explore the shops that have unique items that you won’t find at ones usually bought by tourists. Visit the piazza in front of the gorgeous Trastevere Church in Santa Maria.10. Indulge in Roman cuisineRoman cuisine is famous for its simplicity; as it’s prepared with few seasonal ingredients and tried-and-tested methods. Typical Roman appetizers include fried salt cod fillets, fried artichokes, salumi, and a variety of cheeses. One of the most desired cheeses used in Roman cooking is ‘precorio romano.’’.Besides cheese, Romans are especially fond of pastas, particularly ‘cacia e pepe’. It is a simple pasta dish prepared with black pepper and plenty of pecorino romano. Other classic Roman pastas include spaghetti alla carbonara, tagliatelle cacio e pepe, and bucatini all’amatriciana.It is said that a lifetime is not enough to explore Rome. And we believe it’s true. A trip to Rome can be overwhelming as there is so much to do and so many places to explore.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/best-cities-in-italy/,"62 Best Cities, Towns and Places to See in Italy",Italy,"Italy is a popular travel destination, but much of the tourism goes to a few places like Rome, Venice, and Florence or to cities within the reach of a cruise ship port. But there are many places in Italy that deserve a visit, both famous and lesser-known.Italy is known for its history. It has more UNESCO World Heritage Sites than any other country. It has been the home to Roman Emperors certainly but also to Greek colonists, Saracen pirates, Venetian traders, as well as Renaissance princes, scientists, and artists. It has been ruled in part by Caesar, Napoleon, Austrian kings, Norman knights, Mussolini, and popes.It has also given the world such culinary gifts as pizza, spaghetti, and gelato but is still the home to  vast array of lesser-known regional dishes.It packs all this history in a country the size of the state of California (although with twice the population) so seeing a few different regions on one trip is manageable.With the great help from my friends and 60+ fellow travel bloggers, here are some cities, towns, and places you should consider adding to your Italy itinerary.

This area, along with much of the south coast of Italy was once part of Magna Grecia, populated by Greek colonists in the days before the rise of Rome. It has more coastline than any other region and a variety of ancient sites.You can learn more about Apulia in this episode of the Amateur Traveler podcast:Travel to Puglia (Apulia) in Italy – Episode 322AlberobelloAshwini from hoppingmiles.com writes:When I planned my self guided road trip in Italy, I made sure that I added Alberobello in my itinerary for many reasons.My fascination for Alberobello grew when I saw a scene from a movie where the entire song was shot in a town with white washed houses topped with conical roofs stacked with stones. Upon little research, I found out that the place was a small town in south Italy called Alberobello.These houses are made of a special limestone available in the Apulia region, where Alberobello is located. The roof is made from small stones stacked one upon the other in a conical shape. This construction pattern ensures that the house is cool in summers and warm in winters. These houses are called ‘Trullo’ (plural) or Trulli (singular).While the town of Alberobello has grown beyond the Trullo and has been modernised, you need to look for the old town in the city center to find hundreds of Trullo. Anywhere you turn, you will be greeted with similar looking houses – in every lane, on every turn. What makes those even more special are the lovely vibrant flowers that decorate the Trullo. One can wander and get lost in those lanes for hours together.Also visit the chapel in the town and don’t miss the delicious homemade gelato in the café at the entrance of old town, beyond the chapel.BariStuart from go-eat-do.com writes:The city of Bari has an attractive, historic core and warrants exploration over a day or two. Nearby Bari Karol Wojtyła Airport is named after the man who became Pope John Paul II. It is the chief point of arrival by international travelers and acts as a gateway for exploring the Puglia region; the heel of Italy.For a taste of local flavor take a seat on the Piazza Mercantile public square, in Bari’s Old Town, and order a glass of the region’s robust Primitivo red wine from any of the many cafes. As you sip the wine you’ll be able to view a stone pillory, topped by a sculpted lion, where people were once published on market days. Fresh fish used to be landed from boats sailing into the port, which opens out onto the Adriatic Sea.Eating well and inexpensively will not be a problem in Bari. At the Panificio Fiore thick focaccia bread, topped with regional olive oil is served while still warm. It’s a local tip for a simple but tasty and filling bite to eat. Inside of the popular bakery you can see pillars that originally formed part of an 8th-century church.Don’t miss the opportunity to step inside the Basilica of St Nicholas (the Basilica San Nicola in Italian), dedicated to the holy man whose mortal remains were brought to the city from Myra, Turkey, in 1087. Visiting provides an opportunity to learn about the legend of St Nicholas, whose gifts of gold lay the basis of the tradition of Christmas giving.Rickshaw tours are one way of exploring the Bari’s streets. The compact city is easy to get around and highlights include a 13th-century fortress with imposing but photogenic walls.GallipoliAndrew & Emily from alongdustyroads.com write:It was in Gallipoli where we first felt transported into the Italy of our dreams – an Italy that we didn’t think existed outside of films and novels. The old town of Gallipoli, based on an island, is one of charming and narrow alleys, religious relics on the corners and the sing-song lilt of local gossip filling the air.With a small beach in town, and some of the country’s best only a short drive away, Gallipoli is a perfect place to base yourself for a few days and live you own Italian coastal dream.The sunset from any rooftop is a must-see, but we would recommend walking the perimeter of the old town first to visit the Castello Angioino di Gallipoli and gaze upon the fisherman fixing nets in colourful boats by the port.Tip: As the best way to see the Puglia region is a road trip, it’s likely that most travellers will make it to Gallipoli in their own rental car. Although we recommend staying in the the old town, make sure you park your car in one of the large public car parks by the port otherwise you’re going to be faced with tiny streets and a heavy fine.GinosaElena from passionforhospitality.net writes:The charming town of Ginosa is one of those hidden gems. Located just a little over an hour’s drive from Bari, it has managed to preserve its special traditions, stunning landscape and renowned hospitality of southern Italy.Here you can take an afternoon walk to the ravine and explore the ancient cave-dwellings and ruins of Rione di Rivolta. Admire the Norman castle which is one of Ginosa’s most imposing landmarks and the impressive Chiesa Matrice, a grand 16th century church, which plays a crucial role in the town’s history.Despite its small size, there is plenty to do in Ginosa and great cuisine. Take a cooking class with grandma Orsola at a XIX century bakery Forno Ottocento where you can master the art of making traditional pasta orecchiette (the name comes from their shape which resembles little ears). Go wine tasting at the winery of Domenico Russo where you can savour exceptional first-class wines with notable native varieties such as Primitivo and Malvasia.Start your morning with a visit to Ginosa’s traditional bakery Panificio Piccolo which translates as the small bakery. Here you will be treated to the best focaccia and other sweet Italian delights. If you are a lover of artisan clothing, then don’t miss the famous Sartoria G. Inglese, here you can buy hand sewn shirts made by Angelo Inglese. Inglese created the shirt which Prince William wore for his wedding and the shirt Donald Trump wore on the day he took the oath of office. Ginosa is a small town yet with many bright talents.LecceCristina from thelazytrotter.com writes:Every time somebody asks me which Italian city I am from, I always give the same answer: “I come from the bottom of the boot”. If you don’t know where Lecce is, take the map of Italy and point south-east, where the land meets the Ionian and Adriatic seas.That’s what we call finis terrae – the end of the land – to remark that the borders of our country end here and everything else is a mix of influences and traditions coming from the Mediterranean and the Balkans.And this is exactly why you should add Lecce to your next trip to Italy; experience the unique flavours of the south and enjoy the beauties of a city capable of melting history and modernity in such a unique way.If you love architecture, your will literally fall in love in front of the beauty of the Duomo and Basilica di Santa Croce. The whole old city is a labyrinth of baroque palaces, inner gardens, churches, and alleys that will make you feel like being the protagonist of an Italian movie from the Fifties.Make sure to be on a rigid diet before arriving to Lecce: flows of red wine and some of the yummiest food on earth are waiting for you.Tip: If you are planning to go to the beach while being in Lecce, check the wind first. If it blows from the north, you should hit the Ionian coast, if it blows from the South, head towards the Adriatic. If in doubt, ask a local; it’s our favorite topic!LocorotondoKathryn from TravelWithKat.com writes:Locorotondo, a beautiful white-washed town in Apulia, southern Italy, is named after its circular old town perched on a hill-top. Here you’ll find a fabulous maze of alleyways, lined with historic buildings including some rather grand baroque archways and architectural details. It is officially one of the Borghi più belli d’Italia, the most beautiful villages in Italy.Look out for the fine Romanesque Church of the Madonna della Greca and the Church of St George, a beautiful neoclassical, nineteenth-century building dominating the main square. Here, St George, one of the town’s two patron saints, sits on horseback looking down over the town.It is also worth exploring the street that follows the line of the old protective walls that encircles part of the old town. You’ll find glorious views out across the Valle d’Itria’s vineyards and olive groves dotted with the unusual cone-shaped roofs of the trulli houses that the area is famous for.Tip: Locorotondo is also famous for its wine, in particular, a lightly sparkling white. Be sure to try some while you are in the area with the local speciality u tridde, a freshly made pasta with pecorino cheese and parsley in a turkey broth.MonopoliKylie from ouroverseasadventures.com writes:Monopoli sits beside the Adriatic Sea and is a quaint town that’s very characteristic of the Apulia region of Italy. It’s got all the great ingredients for a perfect day trip – a wander through the old town’s narrow alleyways and cobbled streets, a leisurely lunch followed by a dip in turquoise blue waters at Cala Porta Vecchia.A must see is the stunning baroque style Monopoli Cathedral – Basilica of the Madonna della Madia, with its tall bell tower, stunning decorated altar and beautiful paintings throughout. There’s also an archaeological museum located in the crypt. On the promenade across the other side of town is the 16th-century castle of Carlo V which is a major landmark in the town and provides great views out over the town and ocean.The public beach Cala Porta Vecchia is great for swimming with very clear waters and it is clean. On a hot day it’s perfect for swimming out and looking back at the town, or simply sitting on the 500-year-old walls looking out over the bay and castle.Our tip is to make sure you eat when in Monopoli. The town is known for its rustic home-style cooking and boasts some of Apulia’s best restaurants which are surprisingly affordable. If you’re a seafood lover then a must try is the Cavatelli ai Frutti di Mare (short pasta with seafood) or Riso, Patate e Cozze – (rice, potatoes and mussels), found in any of the traditional trattoria in the town. Our pick is La Vecchia Taverna, a lovely family run restaurant set into the city walls – perfect for a long leisurely lunch.Polignano a MareTurNadine from lelongweekend.com writes:Polignano a Mare literally translates to Polignano at Sea, and when you visit you’ll immediately know why it was given such a name. Teetering on cave-ridden cliffs on the Adriatic Coast, Polignano a Mare is one of the most captivating towns in Italy. It’sthe kind of place that you’ll feel compelled to come back to time and time again.In winter you’ll be content wandering the whitewashed streets of the old town. Polignano a Mare is one of the oldest towns in Puglia and it wears its age beautifully. Tiny, crooked lanes lead to vast open views, and shutters are flung open to reveal the contrasting interiors of chandeliers and chipped paint. In summer the town swells with visitors from nearby Bari as sun worshippers flock to the beach for a dip in the tempting turquoise water.The caves etched into the earth beneath the town are a must-see, and the best way to explore them is by taking a boat tour around the coast. Multiple companies operate tours throughout the warmer months and will take you to hidden swimming holes and enchanting caverns. A tip – if you haven’t got your sea legs, or simply want to have a truly unique experience in Polignano a Mare, head to Grotta Palazzese to dine inside a limestone grotto while taking in the sounds and sights of the sea around you.Tremiti IslandsAlessandra from tips4italiantrips.com writes:The Tremiti Islands are a mesmerising location in Southern Italy. They stand in front of the Gargano Promontory, in Apulia. Tourists from all over the world should go there because this spot is such a beautiful place off the beaten track. They are  paradisiacal location in Italy that need not envy the islands in the Caribbean:. They have white and soft sand, rocky sea caves, bright and crystalline water and the scent of broom or maritime pine.The Tremiti Islands are five rocky islands  located very close together. There are two main villages: one on the island of San Nicola and the other one on the island of San Domino.Visitors can reach the islands only by ferry, on a day trip excursion from the Italian coastline. It takes nearly one hour to get there. Cars are forbidden as the islands are tiny.The best time of the year to visit the Tremiti is during the low season (in Spring or Autumn) when beaches are empty, and the small harbour gets quiet.Once there, tourists can:Visit the ancient Fortress on San Nicola’s island and have a yummy meal in front of the sea.Go searching for sea urchins (eating them with hot bread and a pad of butter).Circumnavigate the islands exploring the caves.Dive or snorkel admiring the statue of St.Pio of Pietralcina, set at the sea bottom.And last but not least, the Tremiti are a perfect spot to relax and taste the Italian “Dolce Vita”.BasilicataIf Apulia is the heel of the Italian boot that would make Basilicata the instep… which I am pretty sure absolutely no one calls it. This rugged region of woods and hills borders on both the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas.MateraErin from ExploreWithErin.com writes:Ever wondered where those amazing old Bible films are created? Those ancient Jerusalem settings used in Mel Gibson’s Passion of the Christ? Ben Hur? I’ll give you a hint. It’s not Israel. In fact, it’s the capital of the province Basilicata in Southern Italy – Matera.Matera is the third-oldest continually inhabited settlement in the world with inhabitants residing there for at least 9,000 years. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site with 155 cave churches mostly built between the 11th and 12th century.The churches of Matera, like many of the homes and hotels are carved into stone and date back to the Middle Ages. Many have their interiors covered in spectacular frescoes. Restoration is taking place of some of these frescoes, but they are so delicate that my number one tip is get there soon. They may not be around much longer.While you are in Matera consider spending a night or two in Le Grotte della Civita, which has rooms spread through three tiers of caves. Then wake for breakfast in a 13-century cave or if you are an early riser watch the sunrise over this incredible city. It’s golden.Matera is a must visit when making your way through Italy, however I should note that Matera is not handicap accessible or stroller friendly. The whole city is filled with stairs and cobbled streets so be prepared to work up a sweat and wear comfortable shoes.CampaniaThe region of Campania lies south of Rome along Italy’s rugged and beautiful coastline. This is where you will find the city of Naples, Mount Vesuvius and the Amalfi Coast.You can learn more about Campania on this episode of the Amateur Traveler:Travel to Naples and the Amalfi Coast, Italy – Episode 514AgerolaAditi from travelogueconnect.com writes:We visited Agerola in June 2017. It is a small picturesque village 35 kms from Naples. It is also known as Mini Switzerland due to the scenic landscapes, fresh air, clean roads and astounding views of the Mediterranean sea. Agerola was our base for 2 days when we visited Amalfi Coast. We are so glad we took this decision of staying in Agerola and discovered this hidden gem amidst all the touristy places.Agerola is situated on a hilltop with crystal clear coastline on one side and towering cliffs on the other. Vibrant colorful flowers are everywhere. During evening it felt like heaven where the sky meets the sea.We had our best dinners in Agerola. Ristorante Leonardo’s and Ristorante Pizzeria Da Gigino are 2 such restaurants which are not to be missed at any cost.We have some really nice memories from our trip to Agerola: walking hand in hand late night after dinner, stargazing, sitting in silence staring at the deep blue sea, staying with our hospitable hosts in Holidays Costanza, having delicious meals at family-run restaurants, waking up to mouth-watering chocolate croissants for breakfast.The main attraction in Agerola for adventure enthusiasts is hiking up the “Path of the Gods” which offers stunning mountain views and spectacular scenery enroute. It is a must for anyone who loves outdoor activities.The mountain village is famous for the richness of fruits provided by the land, but also for farms which produce milk for the production of butter and delightful cheese. One such cheese not to be missed is Fiordilatte di Agerola. It is a PDO cheese, i.e. bearing the “Protected Designation of Origin” certification. It’s a fresh cheese made from the spun paste of cow’s whole milk available only in Agerola.Amalfi CoastBarbara from jet-settera.com writes:The Amalfi Coast in Southern Italy is the ideal destination for a romantic weekend getaway or for a beautiful wedding. This beautiful coast has served as a residence of many Italian celebrities like Sophia Loren.Today, it is one of the most popular wedding destinations of Europe. Its spectacular scenery and authentic places explain why the coast is so popular. The Amalfi Coast offers wonderful views to its visitors, authentic Southern Italian cuisine and a romantic atmosphere.The best way to visit the Amalfi Coast is by boat, but one can take a bus or a car around too, however the roads are winding. You can cruise from Positano to Amalfi and to Ravello and visit all three of the charming coastal towns. Positano is one of the most beautiful beaches of Italy. Amalfi has a famous church in the center which is worth visiting. Ravello is a famous cultural center, where classical music festivals take place during the Summer.Le Sirenuse in the center of Positano is a Michelin-starred restaurant with a famous oyster bar and a private balcony. It is the ideal place for a lovely dinner.It is also a good idea to visit the nearby caves Grotto Dello Smeraldo. They are lit up in various colors during the day.CapriNicole from nicolelabarge.com writes:Capri is an idyllic island about an hour off the coast of Naples.  For most people, this is a dream destination as Capri is a small, scenic island with a lot of history and removed from the hustle and bustle of the mainland.There is only one road around Capri as most of the island is made up of narrow alleyways.  There is also a funicular to take you to the top of the steep hill that is Capri.  Once you get to the top you can visit the Piazzetta the compact town square with views over the island and have a coffee and people watch.After you have discovered Capri by land I suggest you discover Capri from the sea with a wooden rowboat to enter the magical Blue Grotto. Rowboats are the only vessels able to fit inside the sea cave as the opening of the cave is only two metres wide.The Blue Grotto is a sea cave. When the sunlight is shining through the sea water there is a blue light the shines in the cave. Inside the cave opens up and you can see the light reflecting off of the water.  The best time to see the reflection is between noon and 2pm.[Photo by Enzo Cositore at Morguefile.com]NaplesShanna from thereandbackagaintravel.com writes:Naples often gets bypassed for flashier Italian destinations, but a visit to Italy’s third largest city is worth your time. It is located the Western side of Italy a couple of hours down the coast from Rome. Naples is a slightly gritty, real city that is deeply rooted in history. The museums, churches and castles here could keep you busy for weeks. Compared to Rome or some of its other more popular counterparts, Naples has scores less tourists and a visit will give you a much more authentic taste of Italian life.In case you needed one more reason to visit Naples…add amazing food to your list. Neapolitan cuisine features sumptuous pasta dishes accented with seafood, and pizza…oh, the pizza. Pizza was literally invented here and you can find it all over the city. Look for lots of locals eating. This generally means good pizza. If you see a sign that says “Vera Pizza Napolitana” so much the better.A good use of sightseeing time in Naples would be a visit to Vomero Hill. This Naples neighborhood has beautiful views of the city and bay below. If you like shopping, you will find some great deals on clothing and shoes in this area as well as a great, off the beaten path local food market that is open everyday except Monday.One cannot talk about things to do in Naples without mentioning a day trip to nearby Pompeii. Pompeii will make your jaw drop, but Herculaneum is a nearby city that was also destroyed by the explosion of Mount Vesuvius. This smaller but more well preserved city is also less crowded. Naples is also a great base for scores of other day trips including Capri, Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast or hiking up Mount Vesuvius itself.Emilia-RomagnaThe region of Emilia-Romagna is in Northern Italy between Tuscany (Florence) and the Veneto (Venice).Amber from withhusbandintow.com writes: The Italian region of Emilia-Romagna is home to some of the best food, and Italian food products, in the world. It is home to slow food, fast cars, and amazing wines. The three main cities for food travelers include Bologna, Modena, and Parma.You can learn more about the region of Emilia-Romagna in these episodes of Amateur Traveler:Travel to Turin and Bologna (or eating our way through Italy) – Episode 208Life as an Exchange Student in Northern Italy – Episode 93BolognaAllison from eternalarrival.com writes:After three trips to Italy,  Bologna in Emilia-Romagna is one of my favorite cities in the entire country. It’s one of the most authentic feeling Italian cities, one where tourists mingle with locals freely and you barely see a single souvenir shop. Bologna has three nicknames, each which give you valuable insight into the city. They are: La Dotta, ‘the educated’, for its university which is the oldest in EuropeLa Grassa, ’the fat’, for its delicious and rich cuisineLa Rossa, ’the red’, for its distinctive reddish-hued architecture. Each play an important role in modern life in Bologna. It’s still a vibrant student city, meaning that the feel of Bologna is a lot younger, and prices there are a lot more student-friendly to match. The university is a must-see, as its architecture is really beautiful. A few other must-see sites include the Asinelli Tower, which gives you some of the best possible views over Bologna, and the famous portici archways, which are unmissable considering the city is made up of over 40 kilometers of them.But the real draw to Bologna, in my opinion, is Bologna’s amazing cuisine. Bologna is home to some of Italy’s best cured meats like mortadella — a delicious, fatty sliced ham nothing like what you get in America — and prosciutto de Parma, that classic Italian cold cut. It also is home to amazing dishes like tortellini al brodo (tortellini in broth — a simple but exquisitely delicious dish) and tagliatelle al ragu (the real version of spaghetti bolognese!).  Tip: Don’t miss the gelato at Gelateria Galliera 49. It’s the best I’ve had in all of Italy.ModenaIndrani Ghose from isharethese.com writes:Modena, located in central Italy, may not be as popular as other sites of Italy yet it is a site worth visiting to devour the beauty in stone virtually. The city got its status for the Cathedral, Torre Civica and Piazza Grande.An imposing cathedral, a Romanesque basilica begun in 1099 and completed in the 13th century, is the highlight of Modena. Both façade and interiors has beautiful stone carvings. Don’t miss photographing the magnificent 13th-century rose window on the façade. Marble lions support the porticus, and reliefs beside the main door and above the side doors. The belfry of Modena, Torre della Ghirlandina, is believed to be tilted at an angle. Unfortunately for me when I was there it was covered for renovation. I couldn’t note this interesting aspect of the cathedral. Do check it out if you are there.The Town hall the third impressive landmark of Modena is youngest of the three monuments, built in 17th and 18th centuries.The breathtaking monumental square (Piazza Grande) here gives an idea of the magnificence the city had centuries back. Ghirlandina (little garland), the medieval bell tower is a sight to behold. Stand anywhere in city of Modena and keep walking with the sight of this tall bell tower. It will guide you to the grand square.How to reach ModenaThere are trains connecting Modena to Bologna in intervals of 20-30 minutes, Florence every 90 minutes and from Milan 110-120 minutes.Modena Cathedral Opening Hours6.30 to 12.30 and 15.30 to 19 (No tourist visits during the Mass, so check on that too.)Ghirlandina Tower Opening HoursApril to September – Saturday and Sunday 9.30 to 12.30 and 15.00 to 19.00October to March – Tuesday to Friday 9.30 am – 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm – 5.30 pmTicketsTickets cost 2 Euro. Cumulative ticket for Ghirlandina and Town Hall 3 EuroParmaAmber from withhusbandintow.com writes: There’s something about Parma that makes it special. It’s a stunning city, with large squares, a beautiful cathedral, and their famous pink baptistry. It’s also home to some of the most iconic food products, including Parmigiano Reggiano and Prosciutto di Parma. But, similar to its neighbor to the east, Modena, some of the most amazing food experiences lie outside the city center. Sure, there are amazing restaurants in the heart of the city. But to learn how they make their local products, it’s important escape Parma and explore. The best way to do this is by hiring a rental car and exploring one of the Parmigiano Reggiano dairies nearby. Or, head to Langhirano, the home of Prosciutto di Parma, and learn how they make Parma ham. Even if exploring by rental car is not an option, the tourism board on Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi, can help arrange a half day bus tour out to Langhirano to learn about this iconic Italian product. Or, check out Rural, a shop specializing in local, artisan food products, located on Borgo Giacomo Tommasini.RavennaVerity from veritru.co.uk writes:Italy is one of my favourite countries, but one of my favourite cities is Ravenna. It’s a pretty little city. The top monuments of Ravenna are filled with the most beautiful mosaics and artwork that you will ever see, alongside enough history for buffs to keel over.Most of the mosaics can be found in the churches and baptisteries around the city, the buildings look so unassuming from the outside but inside will truly take your breath away. The main 5 are included in a ticket for €9.50 (or €8.50 reduced for students/groups etc) which you can pick up from the Tourist Information Centre.Now I’m not religious, but you can’t help but step back, look up with your mouth wide open and appreciate the beauty! It’s truly enchanting and even though you might leave with a neck ache, it is so worth it. My personal favourites were Basilica di San Vitale, home to not only mosaics but also a beautiful baroque painted dome, and Basilica di Sant’Apollinare Nuovo, home to the oldest mosaic work of the New Testament and a seriously impressive interior featuring stunning columns and a square panelled ceiling.Alongside the mosaics, Ravenna provides everything you could want from a quaint European city. Whimsical winding streets, beautiful open squares, incredible architecture; you cannot help but fall in love with the cities charm.Rimini / San MarinoHalef from thertwguys.com writes:San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world and claims to be the oldest republic in the world. Not surprisingly, many visitors are curious to visit San Marino, and tourism is the main industry in this small country.San Marino’s border is completely enclosed within Italy; however, it maintains an open border policy with its much larger neighbor. To get there, you will have to drive, or to take the train, to the Italian city of Rimini, the only gateway to San Marino.A regular 40-minute bus ride takes you from Rimini’s main train station to the San Marino capital, with some stops in smaller towns within San Marino. The capital city bears the same name of the country. The majority of San Marino historic city center, along with Mount Titano, is under the protection of UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.After getting your optional passport stamp at the San Marino visitor’s center, don’t miss just getting lost by wandering around in historic San Marino. You can visit many of the country’s museums and climb along the scenic fortress of Guaita.As you can imagine, staying in San Marino “proper” can be very expensive. If you are budget-aware, consider staying in the smaller towns of San Marino, like Serravalle and La Dogana. You can even stay in Rimini, Italy. A day trip to the capital can easily be done by bus.Friuli Venezia GiuliaThis region of Italy is adjacent to Austria and was for many years part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its capital is Trieste.TriesteKristin from TravelPast50.com writes:Trieste, perched at the top of the Adriatic Sea at Italy’s border with Slovenia, and only 30 kilometers from Croatia, attracts history buffs, geography nerds, and fans of 20th Century literature. For over two millennia, Trieste has been volleyed back and forth between Roman, Austro-Hungarian, French, German, and Slavic interests. James Joyce lived here for a time; Sigmund Freud was here, and so was Mussolini. It’s no wonder that a walk through Trieste is marked by diverse architectural styles and eclectic cuisines.Trieste slopes uphill from the massive port. Along with the railroads, the port has defined the city, an important crossroads not only for trade but for arts and literature. It’s café culture once outshone Venice.Two attractions offer a closer look into Trieste’s layered history, and both are built atop Roman ruins. The castle of San Giusto includes an exhibit of Roman statuary, inscriptions, mosaic floors, and military armament. Views over the city are really good from here, despite the infamous insanity-inducing winds.Nearby stands the Cattedrale di San Giusto, a 9-11th Century Romanesque church built on top of a 6th Century basilica. It is small but outstanding for its impressive purple mosaics. Pay the 50 cents to light up the chapels to see these works of art.Great food and wine can be discovered in the old town, in the vicinity of the Arco Riccardo Roman ruins.LazioLazio may be the region of Italy that more people have been too, but have never heard of. This is the heart of Italy. and is the region where you will find Rome. But there is more to Lazio than just Rome.You can hear more about the region of Lazio on these episodes of the Amateur Traveler podcast:Cruise to the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Gibraltar, France, Monaco, Italy) on Holland America’s Westerdam – Episode 574Travel to Lazio, Italy – Episode 427Travel to Rome with Andy Steves – Episode 288Travel to Rome, Italy – Episode 29Civita di BagnoregioDavid from travelsewhere.net writes:Alone on a small rocky hilltop in the province of Viterbo sits the village of Civita di Bagnoregio. Known as the “Dying City”, the (then) town suffered greatly after a devastating earthquake in the 17th century and its population has dwindled ever since. Today, it is said as few as 10 people now live there permanently.The first glimpse of the precarious clifftop village from across the valley is truly a special sight. Atop bare, rocky cliffs, you see just a handful of stone buildings up there. As a small village, you can wander its ancient streets and bask in its beautifully preserved heritage. Certainly, the chance to uncover new viewpoints of the surrounding countryside is worth straying down its little alleys as well. The village’s isolation means there are very few obvious hints to modern life.Access to the isolated Civita di Bagnoregio is only possible via the long and surprisingly steep bridge from the modern commune of Bagnoregio. The walk over gives you more time to appreciate its remoteness and the vast valleys that lay below. It’s truly the setting of the village alone among the landscape that makes it such a unique place.Tip: You only really need a few hours to fully explore Civita di Bagnoregio, but there’s always the option of staying in one of its historic guesthouses or hotels, to feel totally transported to another time.OstiaClemens from travellersarchive.com writes:Although Rome itself offers a lot of beautiful ruins, a trip to Ostia, the ancient port city of the metropolis is well worth it. No wonder that the small city is a popular destination for tourist to Rome.In addition to the excavations in Ostia Antica, it is the beautiful beaches that attract the tourists. But be aware, the beachfront is often overrun, especially in summertime, because Ostia is something like the recreation area of Rome.You can reach the excavations (“Scavi”) via the stop “Ostia Antica” of the railway line Roma-Lido. The settlement, some kilometres inland, offers a completely different – and in many ways more accessible – impression of an ancient city than Rome. This is because the urban area was largely abandoned and thus preserved. Some of the buildings have been preserved up to the upper floors.Tip: The excavation site is very large, I would advise you to take a hat and plenty of water and especially to put on comfortable shoes. Why not chill out at the beach afterwards before heading back to Rome? You surely won’t regret it.RomeLaurence from findingtheuniverse.com writes:No visit to Italy would be complete without a trip to the capital city of Rome. The saying goes that all roads lead to Rome, and certainly during the height of the Roman Empire, this was absolutely true. Today, a visit to Rome is a journey through over two thousand years of history. Rome is like a huge archaeological cake, with buildings layered over buildings, and everything on offer from Roman highlights like the Coliseum and Castel Sant’Angelo, through to Renaissance masterpieces like the Sistine Chapel.With so much to offer, it’s hard to pick just one highlight, but if I had to, it would be the Coliseum. Home to the ancient gladiators, and the place where ordinary Romans and emperors alike came to watch gruesome spectacles as entertainment,  a visit to the Coliseum will be an experience you never forget. Just make sure you come early, and ensure you take advantage of the online advance booking system so you can skip the ticket lines and head straight to the security lines. You definitely don’t want to spend your time in Rome standing in line. As a bonus, your ticket to the Coliseum also includes entry to the Roman Forum next door, which should also be on your Rome “to-do” list.For more ideas of what to do in Rome, take a look at my guide to spending 3 days in Rome, which will give you plenty more sightseeing ideas.TivoliGary from everything-everywhere.com writes:Just 30-45 by car from Rome is the town of Tivoli. Located in the hills above Rome, it has been a place where the rich and powerful of Rome could retreat for centuries. Here you will find two UNESCO World Heritage sites which are both villas of powerful Romans but separated by over a 1,000 years.The Villa Adriana is the palace of Emperor Hadrian. Built from 118-138 AD, it was built because Hadrian didn’t enjoy living in his palace on the Palatine Hill of Rome. Several other emperors lived in the villa, including Marcus Aurelius and Septimius Severus. Today you can still see original statutes and much of the layout of the original buildings.The other famous villa in Tivoli is the Villa d’Este. Constructed in 1550 by the Cardinal Ippolito II d’Este, it was an attempt to impress electors so he could become pope. It didn’t work. The villa was an impressive display of water engineering and fountains, which are still functioning today.It is possible to easily visit both villas in a day trip from Rome. Many tour operators offer tour pages to visit Tivoli. ViterboAngela from romeactually.com writes:At some 80 km and one and a half hours train ride from Rome, Viterbo makes it for a fascinating day trip from the capital. Known as the City of Popes, the beautiful city centre whirls you back to medieval times, when Viterbo was a bustling hub of artisans, traders, artists and politics.In the wake of the fall of the Roman Empire, the struggle for power among Roman noble clans made it unsafe at times for the head of the Christendom. This is why several popes spent some time in Viterbo, fortified city surrounded by the medieval walls that still now we need to pass to reach its central quarter. It’s here, in San Pellegrino neighbourhood, that you can better experience the culture and the history of this once crucial hub of central Italy.Alongside the tangled maze of cobbled alleys, the Popes’ Palace, the historical handicraft workshops, and the beautiful views, what attracts tourists and locals, including Rome’s residents, are Viterbo’s wonderful thermal baths, the most famous of which was aptly named Terme dei Papi, The Popes’ Baths. If you don’t feel like booking a treatment but simply soaking in the hot spring pool, you can stay as much as you want for as little as 12€.LiguriaThis narrow region of Mediterranean coastline in northwest Italy is also known as the Italian Riviera. This is where you will find Genova (Genoa), Portofino, and the Cinque Terre. It’s beaches are small, its coastline is spectacular, its roads are winding.Learn more about the region of Liguria on these episodes of Amateur Traveler:Travel to Italy – The Cinque Terre, Lake Como and Milan – Episode 102CamogliCatherine from HerBagsWerePacked.com writes:When I was planning my month in Italy, I knew I wanted to go to Rome and Florence to hit up all the “must-sees,” but I also wanted to get away from the busy tourist zones and experience quiet Italian life. This is how I ended up in Camogli, a sleepy little fishing village about 55 miles north of the heavily trafficked Cinque Terre. Here I found a small beach resort town that catered to real Italians with empty hiking trails, breathtaking sunsets, a rich history, and fresh pastas with unique pestos and walnut sauces.The region is considered the birthplace of traditional Italian focaccia. “Focaccia di recco col formaggio” is paper thin and oozing with cheese. Consider grabbing a slice or two from Panificio In Scio Canto by the harbor or from Revello on the beach. Revello’s version holds an “Indication of Geographic Protection” certifying it as the “real deal.”After you’ve had your fill, head over to the harbor where you can take a ferry to Abbazia di San Fruttuoso. The Abbey, hidden within a cove at the foot of heavily wooded hills, can only be accessed by foot or boat and has a unique and complicated history involving time as a traditional Catholic Abbey and a pirate hideout. Once you arrive, you can relax on the beach, go for a hike, dive down to the Christ of the Abyss statue, or tour the grounds.I recommend bringing some snacks along to the Abbey because there are only two food options — a counter service cafe and a sit down restaurant. After dining on the tastiest focaccia in all of Italy, neither will seem like anything special and both are a bit overpriced.Cinque TerreMichael from timetravelturtle.com writes:The five small villages of Cinque Terre (Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, Monterosso), nestled between hills on the Italian Riviera, create one of the most beautiful coastlines in the country. The natural beauty has always been here – dramatic cliffs falling down to wild waters, natural bays and harbours with calm beaches, lush green hillsides and jagged rocky outcrops. But it’s the communities along the way that make it so special.The five villages that make up Cinque Terre (which translates as ‘five lands’) still have a colourful charming atmosphere to them because of their geographical isolation. Historically, they were cut off from each other and the region by land and most of the transport was done by boat. The hills around the villages also restricted the amount of development that could happen. And so, for centuries, they stayed relatively the same size with the same style of architecture.When you visit today, you’ll want to spend some time in the villages to get a sense of what they feel like. All of them are now overrun by tourists but they still each have their own unique aspects. There are hotels, restaurants, and cafes in each village but they will get crowded at the height of summer.The most popular activity in the Cinque Terre – which I highly recommend you do – is hiking. There’s a trail that connects each of the villages and you can spend most of the day going from one end to the other. There’s then a train to take you back to where you started. The same train also connects to the nearby cities of La Spezia and Levanto. As a tip, I would consider looking for accommodation at one of them during peak season if you’re having issues with availability and/or price.I would add to what Michael said that because they are accessible by train they are a popular day trip for Italians on the weekend. During the summer, visit on a weekday if possible. The hikes at the southern end are the shorter and easier hikes. You can also stay in nearby La Spezia and travel to Riomaggiore by boat.Genova (Genoa)Elisa from worldinparis.com writes:Genova, the capital of Liguria region, is a city located between the Mediterranean Sea and the Apennine Mountains. There are no midterms for Genova, “La Superba” (the proud one): you love it or hate it and many people will tell you they are in the second group. Genova, unlike other famous cities in Italy, is not the kind of place people love at first sight, you need to take your time. I was lucky to live two years in Genova, time enough to explore the city, know its people, discover its cuisine, and I learned to appreciate its beauty and character. Today I can say I left my heart in Genova.During many centuries Genova was together with Venice, Pisa and Amalfi one of the four Maritime Powers in Italy and you can still see many beautiful remains of its glorious past. Genova’s historical center (a UNESCO Site) is the largest in Europe and it is populated by beautiful noble palaces, splendid churches and an intricate maze of medieval alleyways called “caruggi” which open unexpectedly onto beautiful small squares.Piazza de Ferrari is the main square in Genova, dominated by Doge’s Palace, the Opera-Theater Carlo Felice, and other impressive baroque buildings.Another interesting place to visit in Genova is its old harbor, a blend of historical buildings beautifully restored and new entertainment buildings designed by the famous architect Renzo Piano. The most outstanding of these new constructions is the Aquarium, the biggest aquarium in Europe.Finally, don’t leave Genova without tasting its cuisine, with staples like focaccia and mains like troffie al pesto or pasta with walnuts sauce.Add Genova to your Italy bucket list and discover its interesting history and beautiful architecture. Also, Genova makes a good base camp for exploring other places in Liguria, like Cinque Terre, Camogli or Rapallo.LombardyLombardy is the center of finance and fashion in Italy. If these people seem a bit more business-like than they do in southern Italy then you should know the region is named after a Germanic tribe the Lombards who invaded and ruled much of the Italian peninsula in the 700-900s. There is some debate about whether Lombardy culturally is northern Italy or southern Germany. The main city in Lombardy is Milan which is also one of Italy’s two major international airports.Learn more about the region of Lombardy in these episodes of the Amateur Traveler:Travel to Northern Italy (Mantua, Verona, Padua) – Episode 552Travel to Milan, Italy – Episode 249Travel to Italy – The Cinque Terre, Lake Como and Milan – Episode 102MilanStephanie from historyfangirl.com writes:If you’re headed to Italy, Milan is a must-see. While the country’s south is splashy and colorful, northern Milan is more sophisticated and subdued city, full of charm. The city is fashionable, super cool, and undeniably gray. Even the famous Duomo is a stark gray and white masterpiece. But if you do want a pop of color, look up. The city’s buildings are full of beautiful details in muted hues, but they’re both wonderful and delicate.  Once there, make sure to check out all the wonder hiding in the churches in Milan  From a lock of Lucrezia Borgia’s hair to a chapel made entirely of bones, the city is full of spectacular renaissance churches that have been displaying their secrets for centuries. For art lovers, the church Santa Maria Delle Grazie is a must. The church is the home of one of the world’s most famous paintings, Leonardo da Vinci’s The Last Supper. Da Vinci painted directly onto the wall of the monastery, and the work has miraculously survived horrendous conditions and the allied bombing of the city in World War II. Today the church has turned the room it’s in into a high-tech museum. Make sure to book tickets weeks in advance. They’re almost always sold out early.Bellagio / Lake ComoArzo from arzotravels.com writes:Italy is probably the most beautiful country and there is definitely not shortage of beautiful places to go and visit. However, if you need nice places to add to your Italy itinerary then you should consider the region of Lake Como.Lake Como is located in the northern part of Italy, just close to the Swiss border. While the town Como itself is nice to visit, Bellagio is the most beautiful part of that area.Bellagio is a must-see place in Italy for several reasons – the town center is beautiful. The staircase has become quite famous and there is a reason why it is such a popular photo stop for many, but also the promenade is colorful with many flowers and colorful houses.If you are in Bellagio make sure to drive up the mountains – the views from there are just breathtaking. You can find nice restaurants that have good food to reasonable prices that come with a great view.You should know that the region of Lake Como is not very cheap – it might be the proximity to Switzerland, but this place is also as expensive as Switzerland, so if you plan a trip to the region make sure not to stay in Como directly but in areas like Bellagio or outside the main town, if you are on a budget.BergamoSophie from solosophie.com writes:Often forgotten in lieu of its more famous counterpart, the fashion capital Milan, Bergamo is a beautiful gem of the Lombardy region. Surrounded by mountains, the city is distinctly split into two parts. While the Città Alta (Upper City) is located high up and is filled with cobbled lanes, lower Bergamo is known as Città Bassa (Lower City) and is a financial hub for Lombardy and beyond. Although many people just see the city’s airport (many budget airlines base their Northern Italian services at the Bergamo International Airport), it’s well worth venturing beyond the terminal to experience life in an authentic Italian town; quaint lanes, small museums, countless churches, and all. While in Bergamo, you simply must take the funicular up to the Rocca di San Vigilio. Although it’s possible to walk the steep ascent to the very top of the city, the funicular is a fun way to see the city stretching out below you. Once at the top of the city, there’s an ancient castle to explore, a breathtaking view to admire, and many restaurants in which to enjoy local cuisine.BornoNat from loveandroad.com writes:Borno is an unspoiled town up in the mountains of Val Camonica, Lombardy region. Unknown by international travelers, Borno is a truly Italian experience completely different from big and touristy cities like Florence, Rome or Venice. The old town is quiet and charming with old buildings, cobblestone alleys, tiny cafes, family restaurants and osterias.Borno is deeply connected with nature and most visitors go there for hiking, trekking and mountain biking during summer and for skiing in winter. You can explore Borno old town in a day, but the mountains, natural parks and lakes can keep you busy for a week.Spring and Autumn are the best seasons for outdoor activities, and you can do them by yourself as most of the trails are well marked. Along the trails you will find many rifugios, local restaurants and resting places for travelers serving traditional food, homemade liqueurs with lovely people that will help you find your way back to the city.From December to March the mountains are covered in snow and if you go for a day on the slopes you must have lunch at Ristorante Capanna Plai Rifugio-Museo. The food is gorgeous and the place looks like a museum of vintage skis and old radios.Borno is an amazing place to eat and drink. Most of the restaurants cook family recipes prepared with fresh local ingredients. In Borno, the aperitivo, Italian version of happy hour with drinks and finger food starts at 2 pm, while in most of the other big cities it only kicks off at 6 pm. Not to mention the gelatos and the coffee, all them prepared and served with the Italian love for food and for life. There are so many things to do in Borno that you should add this cute town to your Italian itinerary and stay at least two or three days there.BresciaChristina and Adam from oursweetadventures.com write:There are several reasons why Brescia, Italy should be on anyone’s Italian itinerary. Brescia is in the Lombardy region situated at the foot of the Alps. Beautiful mountains surround the city with several lakes just a short drive away. It is a precious city during the day and night with roman ruins, a gorgeous basilica, a peaceful piazza and a castle that sits on a hill that towers over the city.Brescia is also home to Italy’s leading culinary school, Cast Alimenti, so it goes without saying that the food in Brescia is outstanding, including the best Italian pasticerria (pastry shop) with the country’s leading master pastry chef, Iginio Massari.The one sight we recommend you must see during your trip, is the Castle of Brescia. When you imagine a medieval castle, the Castle of Brescia is what comes to our mind. It is one of the largest fortified structures in Italy with 75,000 square metres enclosed within its surrounding walls. Within the walls of the castle, visitors can find a tower, drawbridge, tunnels and two museums. The Luigi Marzoli Arms Museum boasts 15th and 16th century arms and armor, as well as, 17th and 18th century guns. The Museum of the Risorgimento has historical documents, pictures, period prints, and relics on display that date back from the end of the 18th century to the late 19th century. Visitors have so much to see and explore inside and around the castle grounds.Like most cities in Italy, driving around and finding parking is never easy. We recommend you take a day trip from Venice or Milan to Brescia and arrive by train. The train station is a fifteen minute walk to the city’s center Piazza della Loggia. The city is small, therefore everything is within walking distance. A car is really not necessary.MantuaNam from laughtraveleat.com writes:Mantua is a small city in the Lombardy region of Italy not too far from the Veneto border. It was the cultural capital of Italy in 2016 and the European Capital of Gastronomy in 2017. Still relatively unknown, the city is home to three palaces and the old town is a declared UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built by the Gonzaga Family, the three palaces are:Palazzo Te, the summer palacePalazzo Ducale, the grand palaceCastle of St George, the military castleIf you are a fan of architecture, Italian history, and venturing a bit off the beaten path, then this is the city for you. It’s only an hour from Verona by train.Here’s a nice literature tidbit: this is where Romeo was banished to in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. The recent movie starring Douglas Booth and Hailee Steinfeld even got permission to film in the Room of Giants in Palazzo Te. The room is a piece of art that depicts the Greek mythology scene of the Giant’s fall from Mount Olympus from floor to ceiling in a seamless canvas.The city isn’t large, and it is completely doable to walk from one castle to the other or to walk to the train station. It is surrounded by three artificial lakes that also make for a lovely walk.TiranoRyazan from everythingzany.com writes:Just a few miles away from Lake Como, one of the famous lakes and beautiful places in the Northern region of Italy is the picturesque town of Tirano, also known as the main hub of Bernina Express. The rugged snow-capped mountain range of the Swiss Alps can be seen from Tirano, Italy sitting right at the border of Italy and Switzerland. Italian and German language is widely used in this area due to its demographics.The Bernina Express route is part of the UNESCO World Heritage. It is one of the most beautiful train journeys in Europe and the slowest too. The train journey is around 4-hours long and will stop in 28 stations along the Swiss Alps. I recommend this as the best way to see the Swiss Alps region.Bernina Express is a panoramic train with massive windows on both sides to enjoy the scenic views of the countless lakes and valleys, plus a magnificent view of Swiss glaciers along the route. The Bernina Express is managed by Rhaetian railway as a part of their regional transportation system. It is also popular route for the tourist and Ski enthusiasts.You can take your Bernina Express rail journey from Tirano, Italy to Chur, Switzerland or in the other direction. Either way, you will definitely enjoy it and it’s a must-include in your next trip to Italy.PiedmontThe name for Piedmont comes from the two Latin words foot and mountain. This is the foothills of the Alps in northwestern Italy. Its major city is Turin which is the center for Italy’s automobile industry.Learn more about the Piedmont region of Italy on this episode of Amateur Traveler:Travel to Turin and Bologna (or eating our way through Italy) – Episode 208TurinKaren from wanderlustingk.com writes:If you’re interested in experiencing the rich historical and cultural side of Italy, you need to visit Turin. Turin is a beautiful city in Northern Italy that is a quick day trip from the Piedmont wine region, the mountains, and Milan. Although not as famous as Milan, Turin is a booming city with stunning architecture that has been well-maintained.Lovers of history will need to visit the church that houses the famous Shroud of Turin although many visitors are disappointed to learn that the shroud can be only seen once every couple years.Lovers of chocolate will also love visiting Turin as some of the most famous chocolate in the world (and Italy) originates here, so be sure to stop off for gianduja during your visit. Gianduja is a chocolate made with hazelnuts that resembled Nutella.Beyond the incredible food and drinks, Turin has a fascinating romanticized recreation of a medieval village that is free to visit with a park that has one of the best views of the city. Be sure to bring a bottle of Barolo to enjoy by the river, perfect for a romantic picnic with a view of the stunning Mole Antonelliana (Turin’s most famous landmark).SardiniaIzzy from thenextsomewhere.com writes:There are twenty regions that make up Italy, but many people would not be able to name the island of Sardinia, lying off the southwestern coast of Italy, as one of them. Although it’s been eclipsed in popularity by the better known Sicily, for anyone visiting Sardinia, you get the history, culture, and fantastic weather of Sicily, minus the humidity and crowds.AsinaraClaudia from MyAdventuresAcrossTheWorld.com writes:Among the most unique places to visit in Italy, is the island of Asinara off the northern-western coast of Sardinia. The island is a National Park and protected area since 1997. Asinara history is quite interesting. It was hardly ever inhabited. It was used in the late 19th century and early 20th century as a leper and health colony, and later on as a prison colony.The high security prison hosted (in)famous mafia bosses such as Toto Riina and Bernardo Provenzano. Italian public prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino lived in Cala D’Oliva, the only (tiny) village in the island, while they worked to prepare the trial against the mafia and before they were killed in Sicily (1992).Once the local community living in northern Sardinia realized that with the arrival of mafia bosses and their families crime in the area increased, a protest started to close the prison. Finally, the island was turned into a National Park.Nowadays, nobody lives in Asinara aside the rangers. The island can be visited on guided tours that depart daily from either Stintino or Porto Torres, or even independently. There’s a number of beautiful hiking and biking trails. Visitors can explore the magnificent nature, enjoy the beaches – among the most beautiful beaches in Sardinia – and even visit the former leper colony and prison.There’s a hostel where you can stay overnight. It has basic dorms and meals are communal. Guests often go to have a drink in Cala D’Oliva after dinner and that’s when they realize that animals rules Asinara. It is not uncommon to see wild boars, foxes, and the many white donkeys (asino, in Italian: hence the name of the island) freely walking around the village.For a top experience, make sure to stay overnight to enjoy the silence and the magnificent starry sky.The closest airport to Asinara is Alghero, which is well connected to the rest of Italy and Europe via budget airlines.CagliariIzzy from thenextsomewhere.com writes:For around $50USD, Cagliari is a mere hour long flight from Rome.Hire a local skipper to sail you around the Tyrrhenian Sea where you can snap a scenic shot of the city. Cagliari is a colorful array of boxy, pastel toned buildings capped with terracotta rooftops, shaded by clusters of palm trees.It’s hard not to spot Il Castello, an elevated fortress marked by its high walls and weathered towers, that overlooks the medieval area of Cagliari. Sardinians like to enjoy the Italian pastime of fare una passeggiata, or taking a walk, on the ramparts of this ancient citadel. It is known simply as Su Casteddu, meaning “the castle”. Inside the citadel you’ll find the university, the cathedral, and swanky bars hidden inside caves.Be advised that any cave resto/bar is a tourist trap and there are far better views and things to eat whilst in Cagliari. One said alternative is Caffè Libarium Nostrum located at 33 Via Santa Croce, offering both spectacular ambiance and vistas. And for foodies, specifically carnivores, don’t miss out on Su Porcheddu, roast suckling pig, which is perfectly complemented by Sardinian sangria.SicilyIt is often said that when you visit Rome and you find it too chaotic then head north, but if you love the chaos go further south. If you love that then visit Sicily which has its own rich but sometimes tempestuous history.G. Isabelle from dominicanabroad.com writes:Most travelers who visit Italy often go to the more frequented locations such as Rome, Milan, and Florence. But what of the most southern part of Italy? What about the very special island of Sicily? Sicily maintains a rich and very relevant history to understand the complexities of Italian culture and the Italian diaspora in the United States.To learn more about the Island of Sicily listen to these episodes of Amateur Traveler:Travel to the Aeolian Islands – Episode 493Travel to Sicily in Italy – Episode 197CataniaG. Isabelle from dominicanabroad.com writes:My favorite part of Sicily is the ancient port city of Catania. Situated on Sicily’s east coast, Catania is located at the foot of an active volcano, Mt. Etna. This makes Catania one of the best places in Europe for gorgeous and unique hiking trails, volcanic black sand beaches, and skiing / snowboarding on slopes by a volcano.If nature or volcanos do not excite you, the city is bustling with rich culture and history. Cruise the old cobblestone dilapidated streets until reaching Catania’s central square, Piazza del Duomo. Or check out the weekday fish market, La Pescheria – a very local market experience.One tip travelers should be aware of is that Sicilian Italian (often referred to as just Sicilian) is vastly different from the Italian spoken throughout mainland Italy. Some linguists argue whether Sicilian should be categorized as an Italian dialect or its own language. But these unique differences of Sicily from mainland Italy are part of what makes visiting Catania worth it.FavignanaAmanda from marocmama.com wrote:Favignana isn’t one of the “big” names on the map when it comes to travel in Sicily – at least not for anyone who isn’t Italian. For many years it has been a place that Italians know and visit. Favignana is a part of the Egadi Islands, a group just off the west coast of Sicily near Trapani. The island is small; you can easily use a bike to get around. You’ll also discover that while it certainly has links to Italian cuisine, there is a very big influence of other food cultures here, especially North African due to its close distance.If you want to explore a part of Italy that has a distinct and unique culture, Favignana is the place to go. Expect to find a small local community who are very proud of their island. Rent a bike to explore, making sure to stop at some of the gardens that have been built into rock quarries to protect them from the wind that blows across the island. Some have even been turned into hotels and restaurants. Do keep in mind however English is not widely spoken so it’s best to know a little bit of Italian or bring a long a phrasebook.TaorminaInma from aworldtotravel.com writes:When holidaying in Sicily, an absolute must-see is Taormina.This picturesque place is set high above the sea and has been a favorite amongst tourists for dozens of years. You can find here enthralling restored buildings from the Middle Ages and superb views across the twisting streets filled with bars and restaurants. It really is something to observe and is the perfect place for those looking for an authentic Italian vibe.While you are here, check out the Teatro Greco (aka Greek Theatre), an impressive construction thought to have been built back in the 3rd century. Take in the views of the sometimes smoking Mount Etna and the gorgeous Bay of Naxos. If you are a sunset fan, head there in the afternoon as it is also one of the best spots to enjoy the sundown.TrapaniManouk from bunchofbackpackers.com writes:Trapani is a small crescent-shaped city in Sicily sandwiched between the Mediterranean Sea and the Tyrrhenian Sea. Compared to more well-known cities such as Palermo and Etna, Trapani has relatively few visitors and it has been able to maintain its traditional charm. Walk through the small alleys in the historic city center with beautiful Art Nouveau and baroque architecture. Relax on one the beautiful beaches. Enjoy typical Sicilian cuisine.At night, there are no big loud discotheques, but instead people gather at the bars surrounding the town square to have a drink and enjoy the warm summer evenings. From Trapani, you could take a boat to the stunning and nearby Egadian islands Levanzo, Marettimo and Favignana. The best way to get around Favignana is by bike. You can visit the picture perfect beaches and enjoy the view over the turquoise water as you cycle around.Tip: Don’t miss Erice. Erice is a gorgeous walled medieval town, which is only 10-minutes by cable car from Trapani’s town center. It is the perfect place to get lost in small alleyways, to enjoy a great view on Trapani’s port, and to have a delicious lunch.South Tyrol (Alto Adige)Mike from 197travelstamps.com writes:Italy is not all about pizza and pasta. Way up north in this incredible country lies the beautiful mountain region of South Tyrol. Here, the majority of the population speaks German as their native language and the area offers a unique mix of Austrian and Italian cultures.To learn more about the region of South Tyrol listen to this episode of Amateur Traveler:Travel to South Tyrol, Italy – Episode 425BolzanoCorinne from reflectionsenroute.com writes:Bolzano, the gateway to the Dolomites, is where Italian fashion and coffee culture meet Alpine hospitality and charm. A walkable city, Bolzano has a laid back vibe that entices you to sit and sip that smooth cup of Italian coffee or enjoy a glass of excellent local wine as you watch the world go by.Spend the day visiting some unique museums like the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology and meet Oetzi the Iceman or wander among the many archways and vaulted shops along the Laubengasse and gawk at the latest Italian designs.Later in the evening, dine al fresco under the twinkling starlit sky on Walther Square. However, one tip is that after 7:00 PM on a Sunday evening, many of the restaurants close down so plan on eating pizza that night. They have some great pizza restaurants such as Da Zia Alfonso. Get the one with the local salami…delicious.Get out of town, and go for a ride along a scenic Alpine drive at the base of the most incredible mountain spires and columns. The Dolomites are arguably the most photogenic mountain range on the planet, so park the car and go hiking.If you don’t have your own car, don’t fret. Just take the Renon cable car up into the highlands overlooking the city. Gondolas leave from the edge of the old town every four minutes, whisking passengers up and out of the city and into the mountains. After singing your heart out on Alpine meadows, hop on the historic narrow gauge railway and complete your round trip journey back into town.Or spend the day exploring the family owned vineyards, tasting local wines like the bold Lagrein or the fruity Vernatsch. Both of these incredible reds are worth a second sip. Whether your passion lies with culinary adventure or outdoor adventure, Bolzano will be sure to please!Nova LevanteMike from 197travelstamps.com writes:Nova Levante, a charming mountain village, nestled between the impressive mountain peaks of the Dolomites, makes the hustle and bustle of the big Italian cities seem worlds away. If you are looking for plenty of outdoor activities, incredible views and relaxation, this is the right place for you.Before climbing up the mountains, make sure to stop by Lake Carezza, an incredibly beautiful emerald green mountain lake. The lake is located just a short drive outside of the town center and can also be reached via public transport. Since the lake feeds from the water of melted snow from the mountain peaks, the best time to visit is between May and June when the water level in the lake is high.The mix of Austrian and Italian culture can also be experienced through food in South Tyrol. Make sure to try Polenta with beef goulash, the perfect mix of Italian and Austrian cuisine.Nearly all of the population in the mountain villages of South Tyrol are German native speakers. So if you decide to travel to this region, try to learn a few basic words of German or carry a phrasebook. You won’t have any problems communicating with locals in English but some German words show that you have appreciate their differences and uniqueness from the rest of Italy. Stelvio PassJorge from couplertw.com writes:The Stelvio Pass (Passo dello Stelvio in Italian) is a mountain pass in South Tyrol, Italy, very close to the border with Switzerland. The road itself is a marvel of engineering skill. It was built in 1820 and is famous for its hairpin turns and high altitude. It goes up to 2757 meters (9045 feet), making it the highest pass in the region and one of the highest paved roads in Europe.The Stelvio Pass is extremely popular among cycling fans as it is one of the most iconic climbs of the Giro de Italia. However, it draws an even bigger appeal to car lovers because of its exhilarating serpentine sections asking to be driven and enjoyed. Top Gear even considered the Stelvio the world’s greatest road. I don’t know if it is actually the greatest but it is easily the best I’ve ever driven.All in all, this is probably the most magnificent road in Europe and it’s surely one of the most scenic drives in the world. If you are planning a trip to Italy you need to include it in your plans. You will be able to have some fun climbing it and enjoying the astonishing alpine views. However, please note that due to the altitude snow is possible even in summer. Make sure you check ahead for the weather forecast.TuscanyThis region in central Italy is a major tourist destination. Whether it is because people are inspired by reading Under the Tuscan Sun or simply because this seems to be ground zero for the Renaissance, the wall hill towns of this region have been a favorite with tourists as long as there have been tourists in Italy.Learn more about the region of Tuscany on these episodes of Amateur Traveler:Cruise to the Western Mediterranean (Spain, Gibraltar, France, Monaco, Italy) on Holland America’s Westerdam – Episode 574Travel to Tuscany, The Hill Towns of Southern Tuscany – Episode 350Day Trips from Florence, Italy – Episode 242Cycling in Tuscany, Italy – Episode 70Travel to Siena, Italy – Episode 30ArezzoKate from ourescapeclause.com writes:The small city of Arezzo in Tuscany is stuffed full of art, history, and gorgeous architecture. In other words, it is the classic Tuscan city.Removed from the hustle and bustle of spots like Florence and Pisa, one of Arezzo’s biggest selling points is its relaxed vibe: this is the perfect place for a long, leisurely Italian dinner with a few glasses of Chianti Classico and an evening walk around the town square.While you’re in town, don’t miss climbing the clock tower at the Palace of the Lay Fraternity for incredible views over Arezzo’s main square, a visit to the Basilica of St. Francis for some fresco masterpieces dating back to the Renaissance, or the chance to see remains of a Roman amphitheater that is right in town.Set only an hour outside of Florence by train, we recommend adding Arezzo to any Tuscan itinerary. You definitely won’t need to rent a car to visit Arezzo. It’s much easier to simply take the train there and back, and the town itself is very walkable.If you’re visiting for a day trip, be sure to check the train times in advance and get to Arezzo as early as you can.However, we definitely recommend spending one night in Arezzo if you have the time. You won’t be disappointed by the charms it has to offer.FiesoleSandy & Vyjay from imvoyager.com write:Fiesole, a small town that overlooks Florence from an elevation of over 1,000 feet has a history dating back to 238 BC. It is a charming place with a heady mix of historical sites and enchanting nature walks. The view of the city of Florence stretched out below is stunning. This town which was once the bastion of the elite aristocracy is even today an elite region. When in Fiesole do visit the Archaeological Site of Fiesole which has ruins dating back to the 3rd Century BC. The ruins include a Roman theatre, Roman Baths, Etruscan Walls and an Etruscan temple.On the way to Fiesole or on the way back, stop at Piazzale Michelangelo which is a square built on a flat tableland. One can catch spectacular views of Florence from here including the magnificent Duomo. The Piazzale Michelangelo is of course dedicated to Michael Angelo, and a replica of his most famous sculpture, ‘David’, occupies the pride of place in the square.FlorenceClaire from talesofabackpacker.com writes:I adored Florence. It was my favorite city I visited in Italy; incredibly beautiful, smaller, and less-in-your-face than Rome, Florence definitely deserves a place on any Italy itinerary.The must-see site in Florence has to be Michelangelo’s statue of David. The white marble statue is taller and more detailed than I would have thought possible, and it is truly incredible to think that Michelangelo began carving his masterpiece when he was just 26 years old. The Uffizi Gallery is also worth a visit, with paintings by Italian masters Botticelli and Piero della Francesca, among others. Be sure to book tickets online in advance though, or be prepared to wait in line to get in. These are the most popular attractions in Florence, and the queues can be long.Away from the museums, even just wandering the streets you can’t help but be impressed. The city’s architecture creates an enviable skyline. Il Duomo di Firenze towers above the cobbled streets. Climb the Duomo bell tower for incredible views or head up to the Piazzale Michelangelo across the river for panoramic views of the city. In the evening, go back to the river to see the golden lights of the Ponte Vecchio bridge reflected in the water, and buy souvenirs from the shops built on the bridge.The food in Florence is amazing too, and the market has a heady mix of smells to get your stomach rumbling. Cheese and truffle oil on freshly baked bread, focaccia sandwiches stuffed with cured meats, bags of dried porcini mushrooms and herb mixes for risottos are just some of the delights you can buy to gorge on or stash in your suitcase. There is no doubt that you will fall in love with Florence like I did.LuccaFaye from delveintoeurope.com writes:Lucca deserves to be on any Tuscany itinerary because it is one of the most beautiful and quirky cities in Tuscany, and compared to neighbouring Pisa feels well off the beaten path.It’s a city without any real ‘headline’ sights, but as a whole, I find it very hard to think of any as appealing. I’ve visited three times over twenty years, and have found it has grown on me more and more over the years.The one must-see sight I’d recommend is the unusual Piazza Anfiteatro, an oval-shaped ‘square’ surrounded by yellow houses and cafes. It has such an unusual shape because it was built on the site of the ancient Roman amphitheatre.Most of Lucca dates from medieval times. The Duomo and the church of San Michele in Foro have similar 12th century Romanesque facades to the Duomo in nearby Pisa, and each alone is worth the visit.You can also walk or cycle around the city walls of Lucca. The circuit is around 2.5 miles (4km long), and there are some great spots if you pick up a panino (sandwich) from an alimentari (deli). The best views are around the Duomo, on the south side of the walls.Lucca was the hometown of composer Giacomo Puccini, and the house where he was born, on Corte San Lorenzo, a few steps from San Michele in Foro, is a must for opera lovers.The one Lucca tip I would offer is to climb both of the towers that offer high viewpoints over the city and surrounding mountains – they both give great views. The Torre Guinigi has an oak tree sprouting out of the top of it, offering welcome shade in the warmer weather. The Torre delle Ore is a great place from which you can see the city towards the end of the day, but that bell is extremely loud, so pack some earplugs for that one.MontalcinoElizabeth from temporaryprovisions.com writes:Come to Montalcino, Italy for the wine, stay for the community! Montalcino is a very small, very rural traditional town in Tuscany. It’s exactly what you think of when you picture Tuscany’s hillside medieval towns surrounded by vineyards below, and it’s within day trip distance from Siena or Florence.But one thing makes Montalcino stand out from the rest of the region. It’s home to Brunello, which is widely accepted as one of the two best wines in the entire world.Many tourists head to Chianti, but you can get a great Chianti just about anywhere. Visiting Montalcino is a much more unique experience, and it allows you to try Brunello wines that you’d never be able to find back home. A tour of the surrounding vineyards and wineries is a must. I did mine with Select Tasting because it’s one of the few tours led by an actual sommelier.After that, you have to head into town for aperitivo. There are three charming wine bars with great aperitivo: Alle Logge di Piazza (the best wine list and atmosphere), Bar Belvedere (the best views), and Caffe Fiaschetteria Italiana 1888 (the most historic). I recommend hopping around to all of them! Skip the Aperol spritz. When in wine country, drink wine. The staff at all three places will be able to help you choose from their excellent wine lists.If you visit in June or July, you may also get to catch some of the town’s medieval fairs and games, which are part of a greater tradition that takes place all over Tuscany.PienzaKaty from untoldmorsels.com writes:Every Italian itinerary should include a hilltop town in Tuscany and Pienza is surely the most beautiful.Sitting high on a hill in overlooking the Val D’Orcia, Pienza was designed as the ideal Renaissance city by an ambitious pope. Today Pienza is UNESCO world heritage listed and is an idyllic town of cobbled streets and piazzas, an impressive Duomo and several grand palazzos.The town’s strategic position overlooking the valley and out towards other towns like Montalcino and Montepulciano means the views from almost every point along the city walls are spectacular.Most of the buildings in the town have shuttered windows that look down on colourful flower pots lining the streets, many of which have love lorn names like Via del Bacio (Kiss Street).Pienza is one of those places where the best activity is to wander and soak up the atmosphere but you must also visit Palazzo Piccolomini. This impressive villa was the home of two popes and here you discover more about the town’s history and can enjoy the impressive garden from where you get some of the best views of the surrounding countryside.Pienza is famous for its pecorino sheep’s milk cheese and many people go there just to taste it. If you visit Tuscany in the fall you can take part in the town’s annual harvest festivals. The most famous of these is the cheese rolling event in late September.You can easily drive from Siena to Pienza in an hour or it is just under two hours from Florence. Many visitors join a tour that also stops at other famous towns in the region on a day trip. But if I suggest staying at least one night to enjoy the sun setting from Pienza’s city walls. Porto Ercole on Monte ArgentarioDave from jonesaroundtheworld.com writes:Before I visited my cousin and her family who live in Porto Ercole, I had never heard of this destination in Italy. I planned on staying for only a few nights, but I ended up extending my stay with them for nearly three weeks.Porto Ercole is one of the major towns on Monte Argentario, a comune and peninsula in the Grosseto region of Tuscany. It feels like a small island, because there’s only one main road connecting it to the mainland.There are so many amazing things to do, beaches to explore (or camp on), and places to eat. It’s a vacation hotspot over the summer for Romans, but it’s starting to gain a lot more attention from international travelers.Porto Ercole is the main jumping off point to Isola di Giglio, which is one of the most beautiful places I’ve seen in Italy.If you’re planning a trip to Tuscany, I’d strongly recommend renting a car and driving over to Porto Ercole. I guarantee you won’t regret it. If there’s one thing you must-do on the island, it’s drive around the entire island. The coastal views really are spectacular.San GimignanoDivyakshi from quirkywanderer.com writes:San Gimignano is a small village in Tuscany that is an idyllic place that will make you want to rent a villa and stay there for a long, long time. The lush green vineyards spread over the picturesque countryside landscapes are a photographer’s delight. As you enter this medieval hill town, you are welcomed with flowers mushrooming out of nowhere on both sides of the cobbled streets and quaint houses with windows adorned with flowerbeds. Cars aren’t allowed in the town center.The town is known for its many stone towers built around the Piazza akin to castles. The height and beauty of a tower was an indication of their owner’s wealth. So the rich would compete through their construction.  The walk on the streets reminds you of being in a medieval village straight out of a fairy tale.Things to see / do:Walk around the Main square of the city, the Piazza Della Cisterna. The area is full of lovely shops selling ceramics and handmade soaps.Visit the Museum San Gimignano 1300 which showcases a brilliant ceramic representation of how the town looked in the medieval ages.Taste gelato at the famous Gelateria Dondoli which serves innovative gelato flavours.Indulge in a wine tour with the Vernaccia Wine Museum and sample the local biscotti.Tip for vegetarians: Being a vegetarian, I gorged on sumptuous salads at Ristorante Pizzeria under the Tuscan sun with a view of the vineyards.SienaKaylie from happinesstravelshere.com writes:Driving through the narrow cobbled streets of Siena’s old town the buildings seemed to be getting closer and closer together, was the trusted GPS sending us on a Mr Bean like escapade? It wasn’t long before we had to fold in the wing mirrors and hold our breath to pop out onto a small square where we could open the doors and ask for directions.Siena is a city in Tuscany, the hilltop historic centre a UNESCO heritage site (and best avoided in a car). Narrow streets, some with stairs, criss-cross over the brow of the hill. The city’s Medieval origins are evident.On the Piazza del Campo the round shell shaped, sloping plaza a horse race is run twice a year. During the Palio di Siena, 10 horses are raced around the outer edge of the Piazza del Campo, a tradition that extends back more than 400 years.Spend time wandering the streets and enjoying the architecture, be sure to pass by the Duomo di Siena, the Cathedral is decorated with pink, grey and white marble laid in patterns, intricate carvings and gold frescoes. The inside of the church is even more ornate.Shop for leather and decorative masks and then stop for a pastry and an iced espresso served in a chilled martini glass.If you are lucky enough to be in the area for a few days add the Chianti Sculpture Park to your itinerary. Set in a wooded area 10km from Siena. A permanent exhibition of contemporary sculptures can be viewed by following the marked trail through the woods. The combination of the geometric artworks against the natural backdrop and dappled light of the forest made this one of our favorite attractions.VolterraDaniela from ipanematravels.com writes:When visiting Tuscany most people see only the highlights in Florence or Siena, and places like Volterra remain in the shadow. Why should you include this little hilltop town on your Italian itinerary? Besides being absolutely adorable, standing there on the hill, surrounded by the old city walls, it will tell you the story of a less known civilization. Long before the Roman empire flourished, there was the Etruscan civilization and Volterra was one of the 12 towns that constituted what we call the Etruscan League.What we know today of the Etruscans is quite limited, which makes it fascinating, throwing the veil of mystery upon the area and the people who lived there in 800 – 200 BC. Therefore, indisputably the highlight of Volterra is the Guarnacci Museum. Besides being one of the oldest public museums in Europe (founded in 1761), it has the largest collection of items from the Etruscan civilization: cinerary urns, votive figures, coins and other everyday objects found at the archaeological sites near Volterra. The masterpiece in this collection is the Shadow of the Evening – a bronze statuette representing an elongated human figure as if it’s a shadow of a body thrown on the ground at sunset. This statuette has inspired one of the greatest sculptors of the 20th c. Giacometti to create his masterpieces.When visiting Volterra, you should know that it’s a car-free town. There are a few parking places outside of the city walls, which are well indicated and easy to find. The best way to reach Volterra is by car. There are also buses from Florence, Siena and Pisa, but it’s a bit of a hassle.UmbriaAndrew & Brenda from DishOurTown.com write:Umbria is a landlocked region, but you won’t miss the sea once you venture into what is affectionately named, “The Green Heart of Italy”. Here, you will find the most beautiful hill towns, ranging from quaint to spectacular. There are the notables, such as Perugia, Orvieto, and Assisi.Learn more about the region of Umbria on this episode of Amateur Traveler:Travel to Umbria, Italy – Episode 321AssisiAndrzej from wanderluststorytellers.com writes:When you are compiling a list of places to visit in Italy, Assisi must make its way to the top 10 for sure. This magnificent town was founded by St. Francis of Assisi during the 12th century’s religious revolution. These days it is a mecca for tourists and an amazing place to stay whilst road tripping around Italy.Assisi is a crowned jewel and one of the most famous towns in all of Umbria. Like many Italian medieval towns, Assisi is perched on a hill and it is surrounded by 360-degree views.The number one thing to do in Assisi is the famous architectural marvel of the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi and the amazing St Francis Cathedral. This extraordinary building is filled to the brim with exciting history, stories and myths. Take a walking tour of the town to get more information.Assisi is a relatively small fortress town with narrow cobblestone alleys lined with well-preserved beautiful stone buildings. It is decorated with potted plants and flowers everywhere. It is a magic place, a fairy-tale type of town. There are plenty of boutique hotels to stay in, and sensational upper-class restaurants. There are spectacular lookout points to check out as well. We loved exploring Assisi and I know that you will love it too.OrvietoKristy from TassieDevilAbroad.com writes:If you’re travelling between Florence and Rome, there is a town called Orvieto that is definitely worth a visit for at least a few hours. Situated on top of a volcanic tufa 300 feet above the Paglia valley, Orvieto offers stunning views over the Umbrian countryside as well as charming cobbled streets in which to wander and explore the history of this unique location.Last conquered by Julius Caesar in 3 BC, the height and fortress built here meant this was once a very easy to defend Bastion which is now full of interesting history. You will need to ride a cable car and then a small tourist bus up the hill but once on top there is a beautiful Duomo, lots of lovely cafes and shops, and the ruins of the Albornoz Fortress.Must-see sights include the small but beautiful Duomo and the views from the fortress ruins. You should add Orvieto to your itinerary if you are looking for stunning views and perhaps a taste of the region’s famous truffles or a wild boar burger. Pro tip: as well as the fortress there is also a secret underground labyrinth of tunnels that you can visit on a tour if you are interested in Etruscan and/or Roman history.PerugiaNatasha from theworldpursuit.com writes:Perugia is the capital of Umbria and a manageable hilltop university city. Located just 160 kilometers from Rome and 150 from Florence, Perugia is centrally located and well connected by rail and bus.The historic city is loaded with plenty of beautiful sites and buildings which makes for the perfect tourist stop in Italy. The city center is a maze of steps, cobbled alleys, and arched stairways. At its heart, you’ll find a number of large piazzas and mansions. One of the coolest sites is the Marzia Gate, an Etruscan gate that was built in the third century BC. This landmark site could easily be one of the oldest pieces you’ll ever see.Besides old ruins and beautiful streets, there are also a number of fantastic festivals in Perugia. Most notably the Umbria Jazz Festival and the Eurochocolate festival. (Perugia is home to Perugina and Baci chocolates.)It’s great to know that Perugia is indeed a city on hilltops, and car access will prove difficult. The city can be accessed by steps or elevators to the top. There is plenty of parking for tourists at Piazza Partigian.TodiBrenda from dishourtown.com writes:If there were a diamond in the rough in Umbria, it would be the Town of Todi, a town worthy of adding to your Italy itinerary.Todi, is a medieval town, with a labyrinth of narrow cobblestone streets that lead to a quintessential square, the Piazza del Popolo. On this main plaza sits the Duomo di Todi, the town’s Cathedral that dates as far back as the first millennium. This is a site that needs a bit of your time to appreciate. Todi is small but has all the best of the region to offer. It has a range of restaurants and specialty shops, along with some upscale accommodations.People from all over the region make day visits or come to dine at night. The piazza is lively, where every night it seems that the whole town congregates, if not to eat and drink, at least for a stroll. This town’s economy is certainly not suffering. Our insider recommendation is an amazing porchetta sandwich joint toward the edge of the square, named Il Grottino, where for less than $5 you can have, what we consider the best sandwich in the world. Best part, you get to pour yourself a gratuitous cup of wine from a small keg to have with your sandwich.Before you go, a good tip; rent an electric car from Umbria Green Card, which enables you to park in the center of town. Others need to park further down the hill. It’s their way of making a statement about how strongly they feel about the moniker given their region. You take care of the environment, we take care of you.VenetoThere are many places in the world that try and claim the name of the “Venice of something”, but there is only one Venice. But as great as Venice is, it is not the only great place to see in the region of the Veneto. This region covers much of northeastern Italy from the Dolomites in the north to the Adriatic Sea.Learn more about the Vento on these episodes of the Amateur Traveler:Travel to Northern Italy (Mantua, Verona, Padua) – Episode 552Travel to Venice and the Veneto – Episode 182PaduaGábor from surfingtheplanet.com writes:The city of Padua (Padova in Italian) is one of the major cities of the Veneto region, but as a tourist destination it has always lived in the shadow of its famous neighbor, Venice. Padua has always been a city of culture, and one of the most antique and prestigious universities of the continent is found here, where Copernicus and Galileo Galilei studied amongst others. Padua is also famous for being the city of Saint Anthony, one of the most venerated saints in the Christian World.Padua is one of the most important cultural destinations of Northern Italy with fantastic landmarks such as the Scrovegni Chapel with its amazing fresco’s made by Giotto, but the main sight you can’t miss out on while visiting Padua is the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua, the symbol of the city. The church was built between 1238 and 1310 in Gothic style, but it contains elements from both the Renaissance and the Baroque periods. The brick façade of the building and its orthodox-style cupolas are quite particular. You must visit the interior of the church where Saint Anthony is buried. Every year thousands of pilgrims come to honor him.Tip: When you visit Padua, spend some time in one of the historical coffee houses, which have really authentic atmosphere. My recommendation is Cafe Pedrocchi in a beautiful neoclassical building. Although it always has been a meeting place of the intellectual elite, it’s also popular amongst students, and prices are quite reasonable.VeniceKelly from wanderlustbykelleyy.com writes:Dreamy vibes, magical views and spectacular architecture, Venice is a poetic location and a must-see destination for anyone who is visiting Italy. Venice is the capital city of the Veneto region in Italy’s north. The city is built on 118 small islands, in a lagoon located in the Adriatic Sea. This enclosed bay lies between the mouths of the Po and Piave rivers. These islands are separated by canal’s and are linked via bridges. Venice looks like a city out of a fairytale. It is no wonder that the lagoon and part of the city is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.In addition to wandering around and getting lost among the gorgeous canals, a must-see location for any trip to Venice would be the gorgeous Piazza San Marco (St Mark’s square). The public square of Venice, and also the cities prime attraction. It is a public square full of life with the most breathtaking architecture. Piazza San Marco has also been referred to as “the drawing room of Europe” by Napoleon. A visit to this square is a great way to absorb the city’s unique atmosphere and to also view the other major attractions of the city.The Piazza San Marco is surrounded on three sides by state buildings, including the Doge’s Palace – a gothic masterpiece looking out to the Venetian lagoon. The fourth side of the square contains the magnificent St Mark’s Basilica, a beautiful church, with a mixture of eastern and western architecture. Piazza San Marco is also home to coffee shops, restaurants, street performers and of course the infamous pigeons, please note Venice has passed a law where you cannot feed the pigeons.To make the most out of a visit to Venice, head to the outer Islands of Burano and Murano, to see a glass blowing demonstration and to eat delicious local food.From the romantic canals, the renaissance structures, gothic palaces and dreamy vibes Venice is a very unique and breathtaking place to visit. A definite must-see location for anybody visiting Italy.VeronaHannah from eatsleepbreathetravel.com writes:Verona may not be the first city that comes to mind when you think of Italy, but it absolutely deserves a spot on your must-see list. This Italian city is famous for being the setting of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. While this makes it an especially popular destination for bibliophiles and lovers, Verona has plenty to offer to all. Juliet’s balcony and the surrounding courtyard and home is probably the biggest attraction in the city. Even if you aren’t a fan of the tragic love story, you should definitely stop by. Legend says that if you rub the breasts on the statue of Juliet, you will have good fortune. Or, if that’s not your style, you can ask Juliet for advice on love by writing a message on the walls. While Juliet’s balcony is the highlight for many, visitors shouldn’t miss the Arena di Verona, Castelvecchio and the Ponte di Castelvecchio, Piazza del Erbe, or the Torre dei Lamberi. Winding medieval streets, busy piazzas lined with cafes, and the stunning architecture also add a lot of charm to this historic city and are worth wandering, even if just to get lost in. Verona can easily be visited as a day trip from both Venice and Lake Garda, but if you have the time I suggest spending at least one night. Verona is a popular destination for school trips for Italian children, and during the late morning and midday hours the main attractions are swarming with not only tourists, but students as well. If you spend the night you can enjoy quieter times in the evening or early morning.If you are traveling with kids check out the best places to visit in Italy with kids. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/visiting-ostia-antica-romes-ancient-seaport-context-travel-italy/,"Visiting Ostia Antica, Rome’s Ancient Seaport with Context Travel – Italy",Italy,"While the Roman ruins in the heart of Rome like the Colosseum and the Forum may be packed with tourists, a ride out of the city can lead you to some of the best-preserved ruins in the area, the ancient port of Ostia Antica.I was fortunate enough to get invited on an Ostia Antica Tour with a guide from Context Travel. Context Travel is a small group tour company (no more than 6 people) that focuses on travel for curious people. They specialize in tours with experts.I met my guide, Janet Cavallero, at the Pyramid Metro station where we hopped on a train to ride the 30 minutes it would take to get out to Ostia Antica.Along the way we passed the Exposition grounds and model city that Mussolini had built for the 1942 world’s fair (Esposizione Universale di Roma) which never happened because of the outbreak of WWII. It was also Mussolini who started the excavations at Ostia Antica. His aim was to tie his regime to the glory of ancient Rome.It is a short walk from the train station in Ostia to the archeological site.  You enter the town as in ancient times on the road to Rome. The Roman road you see today is just the underlying stone foundation. It would have been covered with gravel to make it smoother. The Roman’s connected their far-flung domains with these well-engineered roads.Outside the gates of the city, you will find a necropolis because it was not legal to bury people inside the city.Ostia was a working city, the port of Rome. So while it had its share of rich merchants, it also had a great share of working people. It is a city of brick not a city of stone. Most of the residences in Ostia are apartment buildings just as they would have been in Rome itself. It is ironic that to get a glimpse of what Ancient Rome would have looked like, you need to leave it and come to Ostia.You will see two distinct levels in the excavations of Ostia. In the days of the Roman republic, the street level was about 3 feet lower but it was raised in the time of the emperor Claudius. When you excavate an ancient city, there is often a question of how deep do you dig. In the case of Ostia Antica, most of the digging ended in the time of the empire, which fit better with the story that Mussolini was trying to tell.One of the spots that it is easiest to spot the difference in levels is in the old cardio (an area of shops) where it appears that each shop has a very big first step. The shops were from the imperial age but the street is excavated to the older age of the republic.There are still a number of mosaic floors in situ in the buildings at Ostia. Most of these are black and white tiles like the wonderful scenes of Neptune that decorated one of the bathhouses.Among the aspects of Roman life that would not have suited me are the well-preserved toilets in the old fireman’s compound. The Romans turned this into a way too communal experience for my preference.The theatre has been restored to an extent that it is used again for public performances. When I visited, the stage we set with a large movie screen. Wouldn’t this be about the best place to see the movie, Gladiator?One area still has a large number of well preserved mosaic floors from various small shops. Each of the floors indicates what could be purchased there. One shop, for example, shows fish and large stone amphora which would indicate the fermented fish sauce that Romans loved.In another area, you can see a number of these same amphora buried in the ground where this fermented fish sauce was produced.One of the shops shows a picture of the large lighthouse that was built north of Ostia Antica when Claudius and later Titus expanded built a new port area that was better protected. This area has not yet been excavated. The foundation for the lighthouse depicted was the large ship that was used to deliver an Egyptian monolith that can still be seen in one of Rome’s public square. The ship was filled with rock and sunk offshore to begin construction of the lighthouse.A bakery shows the rock grinding wheels that were used to turn the wheat shipped in from Egypt into the bread part of bread and circuses, the bread ration for the general populace of Rome. Much of that bread was baked in Ostia.A local bar still has a sign (fresco) on the wall showing what you can purchase with your drink.If you love history, I highly recommend both Ostia Antica which has a rich history and the guides of Context Travel who can help that history unfold.My photographs of Ostia AnticaShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/rome-walking-tour/,"Rome Walking Tour – A VIP tour of the Roman Colosseum, Palatine Hill and Forum with LivItaly",Italy,"On my recent trip to Rome, I wanted to get back to some of the popular sites that I had previously seen such as the Roman Colosseum and Forum, but since I had been there before I leaped at the opportunity to take a special VIP tour of the underground of the Colosseum with LivItaly Tours, their Colosseum Underground & Ancient Rome Tour (save 10% on this a LivItaly tour using the code “chris”).ColosseumThe Roman Colosseum is one of the most popular sites to see in the city. The original design of the Colosseum had 80 entrances but modern security concerns mean that they only use one now. Even on a holiday, like when I visited, there are crowds and lines waiting in the hot sun, but there is a different shorter faster line for holders of a VIP pass. That alone might make a VIP tour worth the cost for some travelers.The Colosseum was started by the emperor Vespasian and completed by his son Titus in 80 AD. The formula for managing the public in the days of the empire was “bread and circuses”, keep the people fed and entertained. Not having reality TV available, they had to satisfy themselves with gladiatorial combat, fighting wild animals and the odd execution.The ~65,000 seat Colosseum held surprises for the audiences including trap doors that would open up to disgorge a wild animal or some other surprise. The VIP tour lets you visit the area under the Colosseum that acted as the backstage for the spectacle. Archeologists have built a replica of what they think the mechanisms would have been for lifting up a cage with a wild animal to a trap door in the floor. All of this was powered by slaves working in the dark tunnels below the arena floor.The VIP tour also takes you to the top floor of the arena where the slaves and women would have to watch the festivities. The rich Roman men would have stayed close to the action where they might get some blood on themselves. But these cheap seats now offer some of the best views of the Colosseum and the surrounding forum.Palatine HillAfter visiting the Colosseum we climbed the nearby Palatine Hill where Rome started. This important hill later became the site of the palace of the Caesars and the source for the English word “palace”. One of the odd things in Rome is that they have so many ruins and so many people old things that you can find yourself still walking on the ancient floors where emperors once trod. Elsewhere some of these artifacts would certainly be behind plexiglass.The walking tours from LivItaly never have more than 6 people so the guides can customize their spiel based on the audience. My tour included a couple from Moscow and one from Toronto. Although I am a big history buff, I was not the biggest history buff of the group. That honor went to the woman from Canada who had read all of Plutarch (the ancient Roman biographer). So our tour had a lot of dates and names of specific emperors, but our guide Rachel said when the tour has more kids her presentation has much more about getting the kids to give a thumbs up or thumbs down for the gladiator than the intricacies of ancient Roman life.The Palatine Hill also holds the Palatine Museum which is in a palace built by Mussolini, who fancied himself as a modern-day Caesar.In the 16th century, the Roman forum was just a cow pasture with some old pillars and ruins sticking out of it. In those days Cardinal Alessandro Farnese built an estate and gardens on the Palatine Hill. Some of the best views of the forum are now from this vantage point.You can also see some of the more recent buildings on nearby Capitoline Hill like the monument to Victor Emmanuel or a very Roman building which is the Palazzo Senatorio designed by Michelangelo that is built on top of the old Roman Tabularium (where records were tabulated and stored). This building is now Rome’s City Hall.ForumThe tour descended again into the old Roman forum, past the arch of Titus which celebrates his sack of Jerusalem. Look at the depiction on the inside which shows Roman soldiers carrying the treasures of the temple. You can easily recognize the large gold menorah. Apparently Israel still sends Italy a letter once a year to ask if they have found this menorah as this is the last place it was seen.We heard stories about some of the buildings like the Curia which housed the Roman senate, the Rostrum where Mark Antony made his famous speech after the death of Julius Caesar, the temple of the vestal virgins, and the temple to Julius Caesar. For many years the Forum was a free admission park, but now you will have to pay an entrance fee of €12 for the combination of the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, and Forum.All of this history my sound pretty geeky, but I know my kids enjoyed it when they were in 5th and 6th grade even though they are generally not history buffs. As evidence, I present my son’s 6th-grade report to his class on the Roman forum.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-27072-05-21-2006.m4vAll along our route, we saw large groups of tourists following their tour guides in groups of 40 or so. The LivItaly Colosseum Underground & Ancient Rome Tour costs €99 for adults and €69 for kids(save 10% on this a LivItaly tour using the code “chris”). If it is in your budget, I highly recommend this interesting tour and the wonderful LivItaly tour guides. Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/archeology-museum-in-palestrina-italy-treasures/,"Archeology Museum in Palestrina, Italy – A Historical Treasure",Italy,"Storytelling of the Nile River all in mosaicsIf you stood still and listened closely while standing on the mosaic-tiled floor outlined with colorful fish, you might hear future predictions from the mythological orator in the cave of fates or Antro delle Sorti.    The grotto structure, likely dedicated to the Egyptian Goddess Isis, was located in what was once a thriving city in Palestrina, Italy.  Archeologists have pinpointed the era to 120-80 BC and I saw many artifacts on the original site, stacked and abandoned in an eerie sense.  Greek columns that had held together connecting buildings with an entertaining hall and sanctuary laid in pieces and were strewn about the garden.PalestrinaPalestrina has an intriguing history, situated in a prime location high on a hillside with a cool breeze from the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Originally named Praeneste, the name was changed to Palestrina after the famous sacred music composer, Giovanni Palestrina who was born in the town in 1525.  Wars with invading armies, emperors and political Popes caused the town to change hands many times over hundreds of years. Destroyed and rebuilt depending who was in power, it has evolved from the Phoenicians, Etruscans and Sulla massacre.Temple of FortunaA stone’s throw away from the grotto, the immense Temple of Fortuna dominated the area as trade built with Greece, Egypt, and Rome.   The temple and its terrace houses were discovered after the bombings of World War II. Layers of a community with walkways, coffins, and amber were uncovered and are now presented in the National Archeology Museum, Palestrina which is the former Barberini Colonna palace.  When the Italian Government excavated the temple after the war, evidence from the Hellenistic, Imperial and Republican eras were uncovered giving insight into past civilizations.Clay figurines of human body parts were routinely brought to the temple by those seeking healing and fertility blessings.  These objects along with coins from the 2nd century, 7th century hand mirrors, funeral votives and hand-carved marble statues are on display in the immaculately kept museum.  The statues give insight as to who the rulers were. The hairstyles told of their ranking class in society.   One of the oldest objects is a headless statue of Goddess Fortuna wearing a gracefully draped and layered gown.MosaicsThe stunning object which people marvel at in the museum is the extremely large mosaic prominently exhibited on an entire wall, in a room all to itself.  Meticulously completed in 2BC, the intricate mosaic had been embedded on the floor in the hall of the forum and has workmanship similar to other mosaic works completed during that time period in Pompeii.  Over time, as the area fell into despair, the laborious piece of artwork was removed and placed in a museum in Rome.  Eventually, it was brought back to Palestrina and placed on display in the archeology museum.This 20 foot wide colorful piece follows expressive characters and their society on the upper Nile River and becomes alive with many flowing stories from Ethiopia to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.  Most likely made by Alexandrian artists, it’s easy to watch ship’s activities with the wide-eyed toll taker, relaxing party with wine and fish swimming nearby and those casting their nets.  Other scenes along the water are a burial ceremony with gold adornments on the hand-carried coffin, animals hunting and battle warriors in headdress and body armor. The style and design of buildings, boats, clothing, and hair changed with the different cultures by using white, brown and muted green and red-colored tiles. Life, death, celebrations, and taxes are a central theme throughout time.  And the aged old mystery with conflicts about the Nile River water usage between Ethiopia and Egypt continues today.Funeral procession with adornmentsPalestrina Valley25 miles southeast of Rome, the museum sits high above the lush Palestrina Valley with a stunning view looking onto the valley.  No wonder legendary leaders such as Emperor Augustus, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius stayed there to get away from daily life in Rome.The museum is not well known compared to archeology museums in Rome, Athens, and other major cities, but the quiet town of Palestrina and a look at marvelous artifacts is well worth the visit.  Transportation from Rome is about an hour on a Cotral bus from Anagnina metro station in Rome, train from Rome to Zagarolo and then the Cotral bus or highway A24 or A1 if driving.I’m usually searching for the best gelato in Italy, but this time I found history of old civilizations well preserved and an explanation to the past.There are many B&B’s and hotels in Palestrina plus numerous restaurants for a day trip or longer visit.Museo Archeologico Nazionale Di Palestrina, ItalyPhone 06.95381005 euro entrance feeOpen daily 9 am to 8 pmPalestrina Tourism Office 06/95302318www.Palestrina.roma.lazio.itHigh on a hill, Palestrina overlooks the valley Read more about Italian Travel  at www.Italythisway.com Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/staying-in-a-tuscany-villa-italy/,Staying in a  Villa in Tuscany – Italy,Italy,"It never occurred to us to go to Italy. That strikes me as particularly odd considering how much we have discovered we love the place. We certainly were aware how much we loved the food. As a history buff I knew the history. But for some reason, it hadn’t been on our roadmap of places to see… until we got the call.A friend of ours, Chris, was planning on celebrating his 40th birthday and had decided to do it at a villa in Tuscany. With the proceeds of a recent bonus he had rented out a villa in Tuscany near the mountain top town of Maltalcino and was now putting out the word to come and join him. That’s the sort of offer that does not happen that often so even though we didn’t know a Vino Nobile from a Brunello, even though we hadn’t read “Under the Tuscan Sun”, we booked our tickets nearly immediately.The villa itself was out in the country. Our friend Chris had chosen this villa from a number of villas available for rent and because of its larger size (it slept 25). And while one could easily have rented a single room in the Villa there was something about the experience of having the entire villa to ourselves that made us feel like Italian nobility. Our kids had the run of the property with my daughter running here and there to take pictures of the small lizards lounging in the sun.As part of Chris’s birthday celebration he hired a local chef to prepare a wonderful meal. The chef, as is the way in Tuscany, turned whatever was fresh in the market, whatever was in season into a feast accompanied, of course, by more than a few bottles of Tuscan wine.MontalcinoWe explored the hill town of Montalcino which can easily be done in a single afternoon. The town still retains its medieval wall and small fortezza, a duomo (cathedral) and the main plaza the Piazza della Principessa Margherita. We also explored the region taking day trips as far as Florence to see the Uffizi Gallery and the statue of David, the duomo and the Ponte Vecchio (old bridge). Closer to Montalcino is my favorite of the Tuscan cities, the walled city of Siena. Unlike bustling Florence Siena is traffic-free so you can stroll its cobblestone streets or eat at a cafe in its main square in relative calm. Relative that is if you are not there for the annual Palio di Siena which is a bareback horserace around the main piazza. Take the time to climb to the top of Sienna’s signature clock tower for a great view of the city.To hear more about Tuscany, listen to Travel to Tuscany, The Hill Towns of Southern Tuscany – Amateur Traveler podcast episode 350In Europe we have stayed in hostels and hotels, pensions and apartments, castles and villas and many as those stays have been enjoyable. But don’t be too surprised if you mentioned villas or Tuscany if it elicits from me a wistful look and a satisfied sigh.Renting Your Own VillaThe trip I recounted here happened before the web when it was harder to find your own villa to rent. Now sites like Airbnb (get a $40 credit) will help you find anything from a room in someone’s house to a whole villa. There are also specialty sites like VRBO.com (Vacation Rental by Owner) and Villas International where you can find houses (and villas) to rent.This article first appeared on the tuscany-villas.it website Amateur Traveler Villa ExperienceShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-the-espresso-break-by-barbara-zaragoza/,Book Review: “The Espresso Break” by Barbara Zaragoza,Italy,"My wife and I visited Naples in the spring of 2008, as members of a Rick Steves tour group. This tour did something no other Rick Steves group had ever done before, which was to stay a couple of nights in Naples itself. Steves did not recommend staying in Naples, but instead encouraged people to stay in Sorrento and day trip into Naples.  Why? He felt the city was too gritty and dangerous for regular tourists to stay there and have a good experience. But either he changed his mind or was talked into it by someone, because we were there.In 2008 hotel occupancy was near zero, on account of the garbage problems and the supposed problem with mozzarella cheese, which we didn’t even hear about until we got home. We could not have had a warmer welcome than we got in Naples. But, to be honest, the city reminded me a little of the lower east side of Manhattan in Godfather II; I kept looking up expecting to see Robert DiNiro on a rooftop or fire escape. And so many cars and so little traffic control! A good thing we had already been in southern Italy for ten days or we might have been afraid to leave the hotel.But I would not have had any concern at all had I read Barbara Zaragoza’s new book, The Espresso Break.  This is an amazing piece of work. It wears the label of a Travel book, but it is so much more – there is Italian history, Roman history, Greek history, archeology, art history, Italian culture, WWII history, several very interesting looking recipes, restaurant recommendations, hotel recommendations, and a fairly cogent explanation of current Italian politics.  And, oh, yes, an incredible amount of information about Naples and surrounding areas.Barbara lived in Naples for three years, 2008-2010, and she must have been taking notes just about the whole time. This book is an accumulation of information she posted on her blog, The Espresso Break while she was living there. It can be used for longer-term visitors, expats or military based in Naples, as a guide to weekend tours of various aspects of Naples. She has seven distinct tours outlined, focusing on a topic or an area, and several additional holiday-oriented tours (even Halloween is starting to catch on in Naples).  Additionally, she has many ‘nooks’ or basically points of interest that you can check into in a shorter period of time.Barbara also seems to have found every English-language book about this area and peppers her descriptions with suggestions as to where to go to get more information on specific topics, which include some bilingual Italian websites.I definitely learned some things from this book. I did not realize that many of the ruins we see in Pompeii are actually modern reconstructions of what archeologists think the ruins should look like.  I did not know that Marie Antoinette’s sister became queen of Naples, nor did I know that St. Thomas Aquinas lived in Naples, nor, for that matter, that Virgil lived there, and some passages from the Aeneid can still be used as a guide to parts of the area. So I would recommend this book for anyone planning to go to Naples, especially if for more than a day or two. It is also enjoyable for someone who is interested in Italian history and the culture of the area. Also for someone who has already visited Naples and hopes to go back again some day.If someone is visiting Naples for a day or two – I would hope your guide knows as much as Barbara. I hope Rick Steves reads it!Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/ischia-island-italy/,"Ischia Island, Italy – The Search for Ischia’s Wild Seaside Spa",Italy,"The steam spirals into the sky, pirouetting beneath the delicate winter sun, as the blistering spring water trickles, lathers, into the salty sea. A seagull swoops from the frosted cliff top, soaking up the unseasonable warmth of the open bay, and we follow its lead; shedding our heavy winter clothes and easing our shivering bodies into the ocean’s warming embrace.Amalfi Coast and Italian IslandIt’s fair to say it hadn’t been easy to get to Ischia: in fact, our holiday along the Amalfi Coast wasn’t even supposed to include the volcanic Italian Island. We had heard, of course, that Ischia was world-renowned for its magnificent coastline, quaint fishing villages and glistening fig and lemon trees, but we had also been told it had little to offer in the colder months – so we hadn’t put it on the agenda. Even our Neapolitan hotel owner advised us to give it a miss.But then he mentioned the hot springs. Offering the olive-branch of English while severely testing my high school Italian, he talked of “the island’s bellissime terme” (beautiful thermal springs), divvied up between several “expensive, esclusivo spa resorts”. There was just oneproblem: they were all closed for winter. After a gentle jab in the ribs from my girlfriend, I enquired as to whether there were any free – gratuito – hot springs to enjoy on the island… and the hint of a smile creased his face. “Sì…” he ventured, hesitantly, as though sharing a secret forbidden to foreigners. “Sì, c’è un: there is one. Un molto speciale terme. Il Sorgeto.”Within the hour my girlfriend and I were stepping off the cross-island ferry and onto Ischia’s deserted jetty. Pulling our jackets tight, my girlfriend took the carrier bag given to her by the hotel owner and placed it carefully in her backpack, while I pocketed the map. Now, all we needed was a bike rental shop… one that was open in December. My carefully-considered plan? To knock relentlessly on the door of every scooter shop until they opened their doors.Even I was amazed when it actually worked.Exploring By ScooterI feel my girlfriend trembling in the seat behind, firmly gripping onto my waist, as we speed along the hillside road on our newly-rented scooter.Winter-weathered agave plants blur at the roadside, and our buttocks freeze to our seats, as we hurtle towards the tropical target that lay tantalizingly close ahead: one of Europe’s wildest – and warmest – thermal spas.If only it was that simple. “It’s this damn map,” I complain, scrutinizing the soggy pulp as my girlfriend jogs frantically on the spot. She gives me a look. “But we’re definitely close,” I insist. “We must be close. Er, I think we’re close.” Another look. “Let’s just drive around until we find it, shall we?” I gesture for her to get back on the bike as I fire up the engine. But just two minutes later, we’re back in the same place.I, however, grit my teeth. To the soundtrack of my girlfriend’s protestations, I propel the bike onwards – around villages, up mountains, across bridges, and through tunnels – in an increasingly desperate bid for a hot bath. Yet it’s to no avail. The hotelier’s heartily-recommended hot spring is nowhere to be seen. The trail for our wild winter warmer has gone stone-cold. And the sun is beginning to set.Hot SpringsEventually… reluctantly… dejectedly, I accept that there’s nowhere else to go. I pull up at the side of the cliff-top road, click off the engine and kick down the bike stand. Then, after taking a moment to arrange my puppy-dog expression, I turn contritely to face my girlfriend in the seat behind. But she’s gone. As I spring up off my seat, I just catch a glimpse of her shoulders vanishing over the cliff edge… so I drop my helmet tothe ground in a panic and sprint over.As I get right to the edge I see a path cut from the rock, leading down to a steam-smothered bay. The elusive Il Sorgeto. I look on as my girlfriend strides across the narrow stony beach and stops short at the water’s edge, holding out a shivering palm to gauge the heat. Then, without warning, she starts to tear off layer after layer of clothing. I grin a chapped-lip grin as I hurry down the cliff-side path to join her, mindlessly kicking off my new Italian brogues.Our bones sigh as we sink, together, into the boundless bathtub: the scorching freshwater spring and the icy sea tide blending together to create the perfect temperature for a winter soak. And, as our hotel owner had suggested, to create the ideal “Casa gastronomia” too…I carefully twist the last rock in place, creating an enclosed pool – a primal cooking pot – at the mouth of the gushing spring, and my girlfriend takes the carrier bag from her backpack. She tips in the contents – eels, mullet, potatoes – and then sinks back into the soothing sea.We realize dinner will cook slowly in the not-quite-boiling water. But as we float in the warm ocean, watching the sunset over the horizon of the Mediterranean, we also realize we don’t care. Having spent so long discovering this secret winter spa, we’re not going anywhere yet.PodcastHere more about the region by listening to Travel to Naples and the Amalfi Coast, Italy – Amateur Traveler Episode 514Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-places-to-kiss-in-italy/,7 Places to Kiss in Italy,Italy,"If I had to pick the most romantic country off the top of my head I would say Italy. It might just be the inexpensive wine or a side effect of the pasta. It might be the soft light reflecting off ancient terracotta buildings. It might just be my imagination. But if you are looking for the most romantic spots in Italy consider this list of top 7 places to kiss in Italy:1) Verona, Italy – Balcony of Romeo and JulietSure Romeo and Juliet are fictitious and Shakespeare may or may not have ever been to Verona, but this particular balcony has become associated with the star-cross lovers. If you and your intended come from rival families you may want to skip this venue.2) Venice, Italy – On a GondolaIs it hokey and touristy? Of course, it is! But take a gondola ride through the smaller back canals of Venice in the waning light of dusk anyway. There is something very different about the Venice on the Grand Canal or the Venice of St Mark’s square than the quiet face she shows to those who wander the smaller canals. And if your gondolier can sing, so much the better.3) Rome – The Spanish StepsPlan your passeggiata to end up at the Spanish Steps in the evening. Someone will have a guitar and will be singing. Claim a small spot and watch the crowds go by. What, you thought I was going to suggest the Vatican?4) Siena – Mangia Tower on Piazza del CampoThis spot is one for the young or young at heart. Climb the steps to the top of the tower on Siena’s main square, Piazza del Campo. With 505 steps the view is not the only thing breathtaking. But as you and your sweetie take in some of the most beautiful views in Tuscany a kiss to celebrate your success will seem appropriate.5) Amalfi CoastNothing quite kindles your love for life than a near-death experience. And nothing has the reputation for inducing a near-death experience in Italy quite like the drive along the Amalfi Coast. When you and your loved one find that you have not gone off the narrow road in your tour bus, how can you keep from kissing?6) Vernazza, Italy (Cinque Terre)After the crowds go home, the evening belongs to lovers on the shores of the sea at Vernazza. Mad with hikers at noon but quiet and romantic in the evening as the heat of a Summer’s day relaxes into the night. 7) Verenna, ItalyAnother sunset, another glass of wine, another toast to romantic Italy. Listen as the waves gently lap against the shore and watch as the ferries ply their trade across this beautiful lake. The Italians have been retreating to Lake Como for generations, and they know something about romance.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/wwoofing-in-sicily/,WWOOFing in Sicily,Italy,"The working day doesn’t start too early at La Casa delle Acque, a small organic orange farm at the foot of Mount Etna in Sicily. It’s around 8 O’clock. The sun has lit up the snow on the dome of the great volcano and the first pools of light have highlighted the yellow flowers that dot the orange groves. The first of the 12 WWOOFers, volunteer farmers, are trickling into the spacious kitchen of the pastel red farmhouse. The hoods of their sweatshirts are pulled up, a weapon against the cold they’ve accumulated in their bones after another night in the drafty outbuildings of the farm. They are from Austria, Spain, Belgium, Germany, Scotland, and even the US. And there’s me, escaping from the world of heated offices and flat-screen computers for that of soil and rough working gloves. We huddle closely around a long wooden table hugging cups of steaming coffee and chatting in a mixture of English and Italian.The rather arcane acronym WWOOF stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, a concept that first evolved in the UK in the 1970s but has seen a real boom in popularity in recent years. As a wwoofer you toil unpaid in the fields for a number of hours a day and in return, you get food and board at the farmhouse.SicilyThis farm in Sicily belongs to a squat farmer called Nirav who is sitting at the head of the long wooden table. His face is lined by 30 years of work as a sailor and by the faint hint of childhood acne. His kindly sparkling eyes suggest, even at this hour, a permanent state of semi-amusement. On his head he is wearing, like a crown, a red skull cap embroidered with elephants. Nirav was born and raised in Sicily, but his love of India is evident not just from his adopted name, but also from his passionate interest in ecology and communal living. Over the course of a year, he shares his home with over a hundred young people who immerse themselves for a few weeks, or even a few months, in a sustainable world where the energy is solar-powered, everything is recycled and the fields are irrigated by a homemade natural waste recycling system purified by stalks of bamboo.The drive to the farm, up from the concrete jungle, of Catania, shows just how unique Nirav’s farm really is. Everywhere rubbish lies rotting by the roadside. The streets leading to the farm from the nearest town of Paterno are piled high with torn black-sacks, leaking their putrefying waste on the asphalt where it is picked over at night by packs of mangy dogs. Packaging is thrown out of the windows of passing cars and the road down by the river under the farm is blocked by dismantled kitchen parts and discarded nappies. Sicily, away from the tourist brochure glamour, is the island that the ecological movement seems to have largely passed by. “Sicilians are always the slowest to accept new ideas” complains Nirav, “We are ten or fifteen years behind Tuscany.”Today at breakfast in the oasis of La Casa delle Acque, Nirav is complaining that Sicily hasn’t had a proper winter for five years. December was warm and the WWOOFers swam in the sea in mid-January and now the type of blood orange called sanguinelli, which traditionally ripe for picking in April are already falling off the trees in February.WWOOFersIn the short term at least, that unseasonable weather suits the WWOOFers just fine. Despite the frigid nights, daytime temperatures reach a balmy 20 degrees – T-shirt weather. “That’s why we can’t leave,” says Martin, a Scottish graphic designer who has been here since early December. “What’s not to love here?” He and his girlfriend Fran, have quit well-paid jobs in London to travel the world. They started WWOOFing down Italy since the early Autumn, but they got stuck here in Sicily, where life plods by in snail-paced chaos. “It’s perfect here,” smiles Martin. Week after week the couple postpones their onward journey as the rural rhythm saps them of ambition. And because WWOOFing costs next to nothing, they have already extended their career break plans from 18 months to two full years. Martin says he was never a great disciple of organic food but was interested in seeing where the food that ends up on our plates comes from. “I mean it’s just so much work, isn’t it? From the planting to the picking to the transportation. And then it’s there in our supermarkets as if by magic; and we don’t even think about it.”Working on a farm is not everyone’s idea of an escapist holiday. It has its picturesque moments such as in standing in terraced groves picking tarochi oranges, famed to be the color of the lava from Etna, with that great volcano peering over your shoulder as you snip away with the secateurs. It’s fun too collecting fresh eggs in the crisp mornings from the cackling poultry, geese, chickens and guinea fowl and it’s charming to shepherd the two languid donkeys, Heidi and Peter, back to their stables. But agricultural life has its less romantic side too. Organic irrigation systems smell of sewage, which is essentially what they are, and crowding around a table in the barn for hours on end sorting the oranges by size and quality – (“Questa buona. Questa non!”) is monotonous drudgery. After long afternoons of sorting, I dreamed at night of drowning under an avalanche of misshapen citrus fruit. Other tasks can be muscle-sapping like hauling the full crates of oranges on to a pickup truck, lugging stones around to build a new terrace or clearing a seemingly never-ending forest of bamboo sticks and shredding them in an angry machine.Communal LivingBut, as a break from your everyday life, the attractions of WWOOFing go far beyond the mere toiling of the soil. The experiment of communal living is a welcome and refreshing jolt out of our social comfort zones. Meeting people from different countries and different backgrounds and living at close quarters with them requires a series of painless compromises and minor tolerances and little moments of patience. The farming, the cooking and the cleaning all demand teamwork, volunteering impulsively to lessen a new friend’s workload. The process makes you feel better about yourself as you begin to feel more generous towards others.And then, of course, there is the crowning moment of communal living: sitting outside in the warm lunchtime sunshine, squashed elbow to elbow around a giant wooden table while you share a home-cooked lunch made from ingredients freshly plucked from the garden. It’s a pleasure that you can’t buy at any hotel. Each lunchtime, cooked by a different chef, we feasted on vegetarian dishes based on giant green broccoli, delicious fennel, and the Sicilian red cauliflowers; all of these whisked from the soil to the plate in under an hour and with a taste that is incomparable to anything you might find in a supermarket. “We may be poor,” goes the old farmers’ proverb, “but at the table, we’re rich.”Around that communal lunch table of WWOOFers, it’s likely you’ll find some colorful characters. WWOOFing, which inherently involves veering away from the mainstream and sometimes feels a bit like “dropping out lite”, attracts the eccentric minded. I met conspiracy theorists, idealists, doubters of modern medicine, seekers of yogic enlightenment, I met some dedicated foodies and many more WWOOFers who just want to get away from the rush of modern life and, on limited funds, spend winter in the sun-kissed countryside of a faintly exotic foreign country. Martin, one of the latter, was worried that La Casa delle Acque, with its solar panels and meditation room, might be too idealistic for him. But he need not have worried:“No-one preaches and no-one tries to convert anyone. You’re a vegetarian? That’s cool. You’re not? That’s cool too.”PatrickThen there are the truly eccentric like Patrick, from Ireland, a firm believer in ghosts who says he has ‘retired’ from the IT industry. Cheerful and generous he has a winning chuckle and he has been at Casa delle Acque for almost half a year now. He has no plans to leave and finally, he has finally determined to pick up some Italian by taking advantage of an EU sponsored language course in Paterno. Every afternoon he drives the few kilometers there and back to take beginner’s lessons with a well-meaning but disorganized middle-aged teacher who seems to have a crush on him. Her lesson plans range from understanding the menu to discussing gay adoption and the pair of them spend much the time arguing in his broken and mispronounced Italian and her atrocious English about the best way to cook the organic broccoli.Patrick drives back in the dark in a beat-up old wreck of a car that he has driven down from London. Only one of its lights work and then only works on full-beam so he considerately switches it off when a car comes from the other direction, driving along in the pitch blackness, the flanks perilously close to the wall, as he coughs out of the window. His main dream in Italy is the quixotic quest to find some porridge oats, which, in a bark of a voice, he pronounces ‘parridge’ to the local Sicilian shop-keepers who, deeply alarmed, direct him to the nearest pharmacy. When, over another sunny lunch, he announced dead-pan to the assembled company that he was planning to start up an orange farm in Ireland, no-one knew whether or not he was joking.PaternoPaterno is a gritty, blue-collar sprawl of concrete tenements and grim-looking streets; the side of Sicily you won’t find in the tourist brochures. In the rain, its rubbish-strewn outskirts look almost apocalyptical with pot-holed crumbling walls of half-derelict factories. If it looks like the set of a gangster film, that’s probably no coincidence. Paterno was once an axis of the infamous Mafia ‘triangle of death’ of the 1970s. Even in the rural idyllic of the orange groves the shadowy presence of organized thuggery is palpable. Near certain groves, you’ll see grim-looking men parked by the side of the road who, it’s said, offer their services, for a fee, to “watch over” the local farmers’ oranges, an offer that few dares to refuse. The main occupation of these grizzled and scruffy looking men seems to be to sit there smoking and looking grumpy while others work. On Sundays, unimpeded by the local police, illegal horse races are held. Dozens of cars are parked along the road, bets are exchanged, and petrified horses attached to carts are whipped into gallops against the clock on the hard, unforgiving asphalt.Yet even those tawdry and pitiful spectacle’s make up the fascination of WWOOFing. With the farms away from the well-trodden path of tourism (you’ll rarely see a tripper in Paterno) you can see a country with its heart out and sometimes its pants down. I arrived back from Sicily without seeing a single touristic point of interest. Instead of sipping cappuccinos in Renaissance squares, I found myself, on my way to chop down a tree, downing espressos in petrol stations. I was exhorted to try local sweet-cakes by the woman behind the till while discussing fuel prices and bunga-bunga with a diminutive Sicilian farmer. It’s far from glamorous, but somehow priceless.Perhaps WWOOFing is the perfect 21st-century break for my post-backpacking generation, a generation that has seen (and photographed) so much and understood so little. It’s micro-tourism – getting to know a small patch of the world intimately – and during your stay, it’s easy to forget the rest of the world exists. I’ll come back with course hands and tired muscles but still refreshed.Will I continue to eat better, live more ecologically and be more patient and tolerant? Well, that’s an entirely different story.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-the-venice-experiment-by-barry-frangipane-with-ben-robbins/,Book Review – The Venice Experiment by Barry Frangipane with Ben Robbins,Italy,"The Venice Experiment is almost my idea of a dream trip. I would love to spend a year living somewhere, and really exploring the culture. I feel like when you live in a culture you have such a different travel experience. That kind of travel experience leads to a wonderful book.Ben Robbins opens the book with a forward that gives a brief history of Venice and a brief history of Barry Frangipane. The forward, a part of the book I regularly skip, I don’t usually care for forwards, especially when they are written by someone other than the author. I read it, honestly, because I was writing this review. Reading it was important. It gives you the insight that you need to understand the author of the upcoming book.Barry Frangipane takes over as the main author in the first chapter. Barry reminds me of that friend we all have that can pick up and “run away” for a week, a weekend, or a month, and has the best time, and comes back with a million new friends, and six million amazing stories that make you want to come away with him on the next adventure.Barry starts out with an introduction to the major players in the book, himself and his wife. Importantly, Barry includes a bit of their courtship, which is important in understanding the later stories. Barry is self described as both well off and impulsive.Both Barry and Debbie’s impulsiveness make the book enjoyable. From Barry suffering his family’s wrath for Debbie’s impulsive decision, to hunting down the best foccacia and gelato on the islands of Venice, during his break from Italian school, he is a tour guide who would find adventure even in the most terrible situations.While some situations I am sure were frustrating in the moment, having to go to the hospital, getting the phone and internet hooked up, Barry puts a spin on them, so that they feel like adventures. They aren’t rants on Italian inefficiency, but a joy to experience with Barry at your side.The adventures continue, with trips to the mountains to get out of the humid Venice summers, to the daily trip to the bar for espresso. Even the homeless turn into an adventure for Barry, who learns that there is a community, and in Venice, they are truly grateful for food, and not just looking for money to get drunk on.The one thing that bothers me about the book is the classic Thanksgiving story. Why is it as a culture, we have to celebrate Thanksgiving in other countries. I don’t want to. I don’t like it. It always works out the same, the main characters have trouble finding all the ingredients and it works out in the end and everyone loves it, and the common language at the feast is whatever the local language is, Italian, French, etc. Although it was a slightly less than typical story, with Barry describing the ingredient location process as a scavenger hunt, and a sign to both of them about how far they had come in the learning of Italian, I still feel like it’s a plot device, or an expected experience. I would rather just have authors skip over it. Or so I say. I would probably read the same book with that section missing, and then bitch in my review that the traditional thanksgiving section is missing. Oh well, can’t win them all, but I’d like to see one fail spectacularly. I think that would make me feel better.Overall on a rating scale of 5 stars I would give the book a solid 4 stars, possibly 4 and 1/3 stars.Sit down with a cup of something hot, Debbie’s choice drink of caffe corretto con grappa, or Barry’s choice espresso, and enjoy.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/expat-life-finding-a-home-in-italy-and-france/,Expat Life: Finding a Home in Italy and France,Italy,"I’ve been an expat since 2002 when, armed with a year of self-taught Italian, I moved from New York to Rome, Italy – alone – two days after breaking up with my boyfriend of seven years. When I arrived I knew exactly one person: an Italian guy named Marco who ran the Internet café I had decided to work from. And when I say “knew,” I mean I had met him while on a trip there the previous year, asked about a monthly rate, and written him a letter in broken Italian to say I’d be returning soon as a regular customer.For whatever reason, Marco decided to become my friend and in the easy, generous way it seems Italians have honed to an art form, so did all of his friends. Within a year of living in Rome I was dreaming in Italian and spent days on end never speaking, or hearing, a word of English. But more importantly, 4,000 miles from “home,” I had found a real sense of belonging – not only to my group of friends, but to the Italian culture as a whole. In short, when in Rome I most certainly do what the Romans do.Understandably, this assimilation defined my experience. On a personal level, let me just say this – if you ever break up with someone, immediately move to a foreign country alone. The sheer effort it took for me to get through each day left me with little time or energy to think about the breakup. What I remember most from those initial months was not heartache or sorrow, but figuring out how the washing machine worked and winning over the cheese lady at the weekly market and hundreds of other small victories that made me feel like a combination of MacGyver and Rosie the Riveter.On a cultural level, nothing is better for assimilation than being surrounded by really cool people you’re dying to get to know better. I could have reached out to the expat community in Rome, but the thrill of understanding, and being understood by, my amazing friends was addictive. I gladly let them teach me not only their language, but their culture, customs and cooking tips as well.Then in 2005 I moved from Rome to Montpellier, France. This time I had three years of high school French kicking around in the back of my brain somewhere, and again I knew only one person: my boyfriend of one year, Cal, an American expat who’d lived in Montpellier for five years.In theory, I would hardly consider Cal to be an exotic character; we’re both freelance writers, we both grew up in New Jersey, and we both possess the expat gene that made us move away from the comforts of home. And, my life in France is largely the same as it was in Italy – I work on my laptop, I spend my spare time with a small group of wonderful, generous friends, and I travel as much as my schedule and budget allow.Cal’s friends even took me under their wing in much the same way Marco’s did – but the personal community I’ve created here has produced a rare kind of culture shock that has turned Montpellier into a funhouse mirror version of Rome for me.That’s because not a single one of my friends is French – and Cal and I are the only full-time American expats (i.e., not nomads or students) in our circle of friends. They hail from England, Lebanon, Reunion, Australia, the Netherlands. Our common language is English; our meeting place is an English-run pub that serves burgers and jalapeno poppers; we trade books bought at an English bookshop; we keep each other informed on what movies are playing in English at the movie theater.Just as assimilation defined my time in Rome, so has isolation defined my life in Montpellier – in some ways for the better, and some for the worse.On the negative side, even after all these years I’m still not fluent in French – for a variety of reasons, but mostly because I don’t have to be when I can always turn to someone who can help me get through a conversational tough spot. Unlike in Rome, I’ve never been the only English speaker in the room. Not by a long shot. And, by insulating myself with a wall of familiarity, I haven’t gotten to know the intricacies of the culture the way I was able to in Italy, relying instead on others’ observations of a given situation.Interestingly, I have become quite well versed in British slang, culture and comfort foods. Go figure.What I’ve found to be a positive, though, is something that has actually affected me more deeply, and which I did not realize was missing from an otherwise idyllic period of my life. It’s the ability to take a breather from the culture when, sometimes, it all gets to be too much. Whether it’s a night in with Cal eating Domino’s pizza and watching old American movies or meeting my girlfriends at our favorite wine bar, I have to admit it’s relaxing after so many years of trying to blend in to embrace my outsider status, even flaunt it sometimes, and share this otherness with people who are in the same boat.Even simply being able to turn to someone and say, “Jesus, how French was that!” and have them understand and agree is uniquely satisfying. It validates the experience in a way that emails to my mom or a blog post cannot.Finally, I believe the real reason I’ve not assimilated here is that I’m fortunate enough to return to Rome several times a year for several weeks at a time. So, in a way I feel like I have retained an assimilated expat life. That may seem like a flimsy rationale to some, particularly those who dream of living in France; but for me, it’s the best of both expat worlds.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/my-favorite-souvenirs/,My Favorite Souvenirs From Italy,Italy,"I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard how “souvenir” is the French word for “memory,” and how memories are the best kinds of keepsakes we can bring home from our travels. On one level, I know that’s true, and I have many precious travel memories of vistas, people, and foods. But let’s face it, it’s nice to bring home something tangible, too.Of course, one person’s cherished souvenir is another person’s tacky piece of plastic. While I do have one of those mini-Eiffel Towers I bought near the base of the life-sized monument in Paris during a college trip, however, the souvenirs that are nearest and dearest to my heart are things that don’t look much like travel souvenirs at all.BowlsI’ve never been compelled to collect decorative spoons or shot glasses (although the latter are decidedly more useful in certain circumstances), but I do like to add to my kitchen cupboards when I travel. Specifically, I’ve brought home pottery bowls from several places.I have a wide cream-colored bowl with big dark olives crudely painted in the basin and cracks in the glaze – and distinct memories of buying it from the woman who made it in Nîmes. Her shop was barely big enough for the two of us, my French was bad and my math was worse, and I ended up inadvertently haggling with her on the price of all the items I wanted. I only had so many French francs, and although it was less than the cost of the pieces I was buying, it was close enough and she let me have them.Another bowl in my mis-matched cupboard came from the rust-colored hilltop town of Rousillon. Everything in and around the town is informed by the color of the rocks (and therefore the dust) that surrounds them, and many of the trinkets on sale in the shops lining the narrow streets are equally vibrant. Whether they feel like they have to compete against the rich red hills for your attention, I don’t know – but in one shop, a brightly-painted bowl caught my eye. It’s festooned with stripes of various colors both inside and out, it lacks in anything remotely close to subtlety, it’s the perfect size for ice cream, and each time I use it I recall how tenacious that red dust was when I tried to clean my shoes that night.LinensOne of my very favorite things to bring home from a trip is linen – it has the enormous benefit of not being breakable, so it’s easy to squeeze and squish into any bag (or use as padding for any fragile purchases). As a result, my linen collection is, like my bowl cupboard, a hodge-podge of designs, colors, and memories.From Provence I brought home my own set of the ubiquitous bright yellow and blue tablecloths and napkins that were on the table at our B&B every morning. I’d seen them in pretty shops in town, but I waited until I found the outdoor market and bought them for a fraction of the fancy shop’s asking price.Another Provençal acquisition from another trip was made possible only by the fact that a fabric shop happened to be on one of the main streets in Arles leading away from the magnificent arena. I thought I was walking into a store where I could buy yet another bright tablecloth, but found myself surrounded instead by huge bolts of raw fabric. I ended up buying enough (based on some rough metric-to-imperial measurements math by my husband) to make a duvet cover, which is on my bed every night.When I first went to the northeast corner of Italy and went up into the Dolomites, I felt like I’d crossed some unseen border into Austria – the little ski town I visited looked utterly non-Italian. The tablecloth I bought there doesn’t look Italian, either – there’s no flourish to it at all. It’s a utilitarian white-and-light-green check with a decorative (but not dainty) white scalloped border. The napkins, on the other hand, are antique-colored in green, red, and yellow and depict the contents of some Italian pantry. Jars of olives and tiny onions, cans of tomatoes and sardines, boxes of candy and tins of coffee. All the labels on those napkins are in Italian, reminding me I hadn’t left the country to buy them.CoffeeI’m lucky to live in a coffee-centric city in the U.S., so I’m not forced to bring home coffee from my travels in order to make a good cup. But one of my favorite souvenirs that I’ve ever brought home is a coffee accessory.When I housesat for some friends in Milan a few years ago, I had to stop my host mid-sentence as she was giving me the run-through of her kitchen. She’d absently pointed to a cylindrical metal container on the shelf saying, “And there’s the dosacaffè” and I had absolutely no idea what she meant. As it turned out, this clever device not only stores coffee grounds, it also doses them out (via a small hole in its base and a lever that rotates to open and close it) into the metal strainers used in Italian stovetop mokapots (like Bialetti makes).At that moment, I knew I couldn’t leave Italy without one of my own. I found a tiny shop around the corner from her apartment selling everything from electric tea kettles to screwdrivers (from a space the size of a walk-in closet) and asked if she knew what a dosacaffè was. She did, and she had one – right next to the dosazucchero (sugar doser). Me and my sweet tooth took a pass on that, but I use my dosacaffè every single morning at home.MemoriesIf any one of the things I’ve talked about here had been given to me as a gift by someone else rather than found by me in a place I visited, I’m sure I wouldn’t care about it quite so much. Yes, I’d like it, and I’d use it – but it would be impossible for me to be swept back to a dusty red hilltop town in southern France just because I decide to use a particular ice cream bowl if I hadn’t been there to buy it.The things we bring home from our travels are important for the places they take us when we’re back in our own homes surrounded by the everyday, and for this reason I believe the best souvenirs are the ones you’ll use over and over again – not the things you protect in glass-fronted display cases that never get held or even noticed.Souvenirs, it turns out, are quite a bit like memories – they’re forgotten if they’re too long ignored.photos, top to bottom, by: Cameron Nordholm, basykes, _Zeta_Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/the-4-best-hiking-destinations-in-jamaica/,The 4 Best Hiking Destinations in Jamaica,Jamaica,"Most people book a trip to the Caribbean seeking white sandy beaches, a warm turquoise ocean and great rum. But there’s a growing market of active travelers, people who want to do more than simply listen to Bob Marley and lay on the beach for seven consecutive days (not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s your vacation!). If you’re one of these active travelers, this is one blog post you’ll enjoy.If you’ve never been to Jamaica before it’s important to note that this is one of the larger Caribbean islands. To give you a rough idea, it takes about two hours to drive from Montego Bay to Ochos Rios and that’s just the northern part of the island. But size does have its advantages, and Jamaica offers would-be travelers some of the best hiking in the Caribbean.Blue Mountain Peak TrailAscending from the Portland Gap, the Blue Mountain Peak Trail should take you approximately 2.5 hours as it’s a 5.6 km (3.5 mile) hike. You’ll get to enjoy Jamaica’s highest peak but and the beautiful, natural landscape on your way up. Coffee lovers take note: this is home to Jamaica’s famous Blue Mountain Coffee! Active travelers can choose to hike with or without a guide; it’ll depend on your comfort level and experience hiking.Cockpit Country TrailsLocated on the north western part of the island, Cockpit Country is a challenging area as it features steeper hills. Make your way to the Barbecue Bottom Road which runs north-south and from there you’ll find two old historic trails: The Troy Trail and The Quick Step Trail. These trails are not easy to find and are seldom used, so a knowledgeable local guide is absolutely essential on these routes.Mount Zion Hill WalkThis is not a traditional hike but rather an interesting 2-mile walk from Montego Bay, to an authentic rural community on Mount Zion. At a leisurely pace you’ll reach Mount Zion in 2 hours (you can run it in 40 minutes!) along a well worn path that winds upward through pastures, farms and orchards. Mount Zion boasts a church built in 1861, a primary school that serves the hill communities and a rum shop where the Red Stripe beer is always ice cold.Mayfield FallsNestled in the Dolphin Head Mountains near Westmoreland, Mayfield Falls offers one of the most refreshing hikes in Jamaica! With 2 waterfalls, natural pools, and plenty of tropical plants, birds and butterflies, it’s far enough off the beaten path so as not to be an overly commercial destination. The climb takes anywhere from 45 minutes to several hours, all dependent on how long you want to splash around in the many pools – the “Washing Machine” falls are the most fun. A delicious jerk chicken lunch awaits at the end of the waterfall climb.This article was written by Susanne Richards for Luxury Retreats http://www.luxuryretreats.com/, a great place to find villas in Jamaica to rent.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/day-papal-paparazzi/,My Day as Papal Paparazzi,Jordan,"I stood in the shade from the hot Jordanian sun near the Jordan river at the site where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist. I had claimed a spot under a small tree in the line of photographers. To my left was a photographer from Oregon who had been hired by the Tourism Board. To the right was an AP photographer and past that another U.S. film crew that normally shoots Amazing Race who had been hired by the Royal family. The area bristled with tripods and large telephoto lenses. Mine was easily the least impressive of any of the gear being used, since these were professional photographers and videographers. But around my neck was a press pass that bore the name of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Papal seal. We were waiting for the pope.Travel blogging has occasionally led me into interesting circumstances. The original plan, when the Jordan Tourism board invited me to their country, was to see the sites and report on why people should visit this middle eastern jewel of a country. Those plans changed a bit when the pope decided to visit Jordan for his first time. A portion of the Jordanian population is Christian although the percentage is debated since Jordanian law does not allow asking the question “what is your religion?” The country’s population has grown with refugees over the years from Palestine, Iraq, and Syrian. Some of these refugees are also Christian.The first I heard of the papal visit was that the Tourism Board wanted to know if I was willing to attend a mass at Amman stadium but that was later changed to this more private affair. The pope would travel to the baptism site with the Royal Family and then would meet with refugees in an unfinished Russian Orthodox church nearby.In my new role as a photojournalist I wore my photo id which allowed me to walk past the guards into the government building where the press gathered and then boarded buses for Bethany (“House of John [the Baptist]”), Jordan. We arrived a little before 3:30pm and boarded the buses about a half hour later. It is a 45 minute drive down into the rift valley where the Jordan river flows into the Dead Sea. As you descend into the rift valley below sea level the temperature rises 1 degree C for every 100 meters and the Mediterranean climate turns much warmer.We arrived. We claimed a spot. We waited.The process reminded me of the times that I have had a chance to watch a movie being made. It all looks more glamorous from the outside. Most of the journalists were carrying equipment that weighed 2-10 times as much as my small camera (Canon T5i with a 28-200mm Tamron zoom lens).  No one quite new what was happening. I heard rumors that one of the other of the 3 spots where the pope would stop had food and water for journalists. Many plans had been kept secret for security reasons.We waited an hour and a half for the golf carts with the pope and royal family to show up. They had a brief conversation. The pope, who is not a young man, was helped down the steps to the small spring which had been cleaned and refilled with water as we waited. He took a few minutes to pray at the site and they were off again. The stop took about 5 minutes. As the VIPs headed to their next stop at the current site of the Jordan river, the press trekked to the 3rd site, a church full of expectant pilgrims.The pilgrims, mostly refugees, sang hymns and waved banners and waited for the pope to come. When he arrived they greeted him with shouts of “Viva Papa!” The pope spoke in Italian, a bishop translated a shorter version of his speech into Arabic. Some pilgrims were allowed to make short statements in a variety of languages. Gifts were presented. Children choirs sang. Representatives received a papal blessing. After about an hour of this, almost all of it in languages that I did not understand, there was the “Holy Scrum” where the pope walked into the audience and people pushed forward to be blessed. I was worried for him as this same frail man who had need help walking down the steps was now the center of a frightening amount of attention. Strong men tried to lend some order to the chaos.On the bus back to Amman the journalists who do this regularly broke out their food that they had had the foresight to pack. Their opened up their laptops and started writing stories, editing videos and photographs. One journalist from Madrid said he would love to catch the soccer finals tonight featuring Real Madrid but he would still have more work to do. He hoped to catch the second quarter. Another journalist from Washington D.C. planned to get up at 5:30am to cover the pope’s flight, then he would follow him to Israel.I have a renewed appreciation for journalists and photo journalists after a day of working alongside them. I also now have no desire to be one.My photos of the Pope’s visitShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/jordan-travel/,Jordan Travel – More Than Just Petra,Jordan," baking Bedouin breadUnexpected JordanMy local guide Mohammed tossed the dough he had been kneading into the fire and covered it carefully with the hot coals. Nearby the blackened bedouin teapot brewed the sweet mixture of black tea and sage tea. Behind us lay an archeological dig of a village from 10,000 years ago. This may not have been the Jordan I asked for, but it definitely was the Jordan I desired.When the Jordan Tourism Board asked where I wanted to go in their country I told them Petra and Amman and where ever else they wanted me to see. I was on the third day of my trip, had not been to either Petra or Amman and was having the time of my life.Many visitors to Jordan are day-trippers. They cross the border from Israel long enough to see the ancient Nabatean city of Petra or even fly in from Russia to make a quick stop at Bethany, the site of the baptism of Jesus, with maybe a quick stop at Mt Nebo where Moses glimpsed the promised land before he died. I suggest a deeper look is worth the effort.Ma’in Hot SpringsMa’in Hot SpringsMy first night in Jordan was spent at Ma’in Hot Springs. In the desolate area that leads down to the Dead Sea, this hidden valley provides an oasis of green. I ate my dinner listening to the sound of the nearby waterfall.Wadi Mujib – JordanWadi Mujib Nature ReserveIn terms of hidden valleys, our next stop at the Wadi Mujib Nature Preserve provided an adventure that rivals any hike I have taken. My guide Waleed and I hiked up the narrow wadi or gorge which was just barely wide enough to hold a small river. I have hiked to the narrows in Zion National Park and this hike reminded me of that experience. Towering sandstone cliffs on either side had been carved by the water. You hike, not next to a river but in it.In Wadi Mujib, you occasionally need to pull yourself up against the current on ropes or metal ladders that have been strategically placed in the canyon. There were one or two moments that I was not sure I was going to be able to tackle a particular bolder or cataract, but with more than a few scrapes and shoes full of pebbles, we made it to the waterfall an hour up the wadi. Those who are more adventurous than me, and probably in better shape, can arrange to do a technical climb of the waterfall.Crown Plaza Dead SeaDead SeaI had heard how easy it is to float in the Dead Sea but was still surprised by the experience. The expansive and impressive Crown Plaza Dead Sea has a small beach with sandbags laid down on the rocky bottom to make getting into the sea easier. I had been told that any small cut would sting in the very salty water. I had even taken precautions not to shave with a blade that day, but perhaps next time I would not hike up to a waterfall before swimming in the Dead Sea as I felt every scrape I had given myself in that experience.The sign at the shore declared “proper bathing attire” was required. It was fairly clear that that sign had a different meaning to the international guests. A Spanish woman interpreted that as not requiring a top (which is not what I think they meant), two German women wore rather attractive bikinis, Japanese women wore what I would call fairly conservative one-piece swimsuits. But some Saudi women stretched my definition of conservative as they wore lycra suits that stretched from ankle to hood to wrist and included a sort of dress that kept the outfit from being too form-fitting. Those who had exposed skin were covering it with black Dead Sea mud which is supposed to be good for your skin.Because the Dead Sea is below sea level, the atmosphere is thicker and it is more difficult to get a sunburn, so it can be an ideal spot to work on your tan.Lot’s WifeMany people seemed to prefer the hotel’s massive pool over the beach. My guide told me that some strict Muslims won’t even look at the Dead Sea as this was the site of Sodom and Gomorra. A local formation is known as “Lot’s wife”, and is purported to be the pillar of salt that she became when she turned back to see those cities contrary to the instructions of God.Archeological DigDana Nature PreserveWhich leads me back to my Bedouin fire, with the baking bread in the sand and teapot. I was staying at the Feynan Ecolodge in one of the dry wadis near the small Bedouin camp where my local guide Mohammed had grown up. We hopped on mountain bikes and biked down the dirt road to the camp where large enclosures prepared for 400 guests at a wedding the next day. One tent was for the men and the other for the women. We biked past a ruined castle and Byzantine church to a nearby dry riverbed, and up that river bed which had been the site of a flash flood just a week or two previous.Above the riverbed, archeologists had spotted signs of this village. Digging out the village was not complete but already the shape of rooms were clear and a collection of stone implements was growing. Nearby am even older village was being excavated that has been dated back 12,000 years.Activities from the Eco Lodge include hikes up the wadi through the Dana Nature Preserve to a guest house at the other end of the trail. Waleed told me that the hike takes 8 hours uphill but only 5 downhill. You can also hike 2 hours to nearby ancient copper mine shafts where many Christians were sent during Roman times to work themselves to death. You can also spend the day as a goat shepherd.Bedouin bread and teaMohammad took the bread from the fire and knocked off the coals. He poured the sweet tea. As I sat there sweaty from the ride, still with my sore muscles,  eating bedouin bread it seemed a bit like a metaphor. If you are willing to get a little dirty (muddy, sweaty or sore) you might end up discovering more in this country of Jordan.This article is sponsored by Gatwick Parking.

https://amateurtraveler.com/discover-the-lost-city-of-petra/,Discover the Lost City of Petra,Jordan,"If you are heading to Jordan, you are probably already planning to visit the beautiful ancient city of Petra. If not you should. This article will give you some more information about what to see there.Who Built Petra?Petra is old, very old. It’s so old that evidence has been found that indicates a settlement in the area since prehistoric times. The UNESCO World Heritage Site that we see today is a much more recent addition to this ancient place having been built by the Nabateans, who were Arab traders, in the 4th century BC. While the Petra we see today was being founded the Romans were ominously starting to conquer their neighbors (we all know how that ended up) and Alexander the Great had finished conquering the biggest empire the world had ever seen.In the last 1300 years, it has changed hands multiple times being ruled by the Romans, Byzantines, and Crusaders at various times (evidence suggests that by the time the Crusaders occupied Petra it was already deserted). It was lost to the Western World after it fell out of the Crusader’s hands in the 12th century.  It appears after the departure of the Crusaders the cit fell into further disrepair and was again left to the local nomadic tribes.  The main reasons for its abandonment seem to lie first in an earthquake that shook the area in 365AD which destroyed the intricate water system and weakened many buildings. Secondly, it appears that after the collapse of the Roman Empire the trade routes, which the Nabateans had relied on, no longer passed through Petra which resulted in a huge loss of wealth.Where is Petra?Petra is located in the Ma’an Governorate, Jordan and is a good 3-hour drive away from the capital city of Amman.AdmissionFull admission for the city of Petra is 50 Jordanian Dinar or £55/$70 a day. You really want a few days to explore it fully.Motor vehicles aren’t allowed into the site but for those who hate the idea of walking in the burning sun, you can hire a horse and/or a carriage to make getting around a little more comfortable. It is at least 1 km from the entrance gate to the city itself.Getting ThereThe walk from the entrance to Petra to the Treasury is 1.2 kilometers or at least 20 minutes but getting there is half the fun. For the first half of that journey, you will see some tombs and other structures.But the second half of the walk is the more memorable part as you walk through the slot canyon that many of us saw for the first time in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. In many places, there are channels for water carved into the stone wall.You can get a ride on a cart from one of the many vendors if you are not interested in walking the distance. I would recommend a  donkey ride. Although I have to warn tourists here, specifically female tourists, that you should be alert especially when traveling alone. There have been rare cases of tourists being assaulted by their donkey tour guide; although this is very rare I would urge caution.Notable SitesThe TreasuryThe most recognizable part of the ‘Lost City’ is probably the Treasury building. There are few things that will prepare you for this site; a 30m wide and over 40m high facade intricately carved right out of the red rock. To a layman’s eyes e.g. mine, the effort, skill and time that must have gone into that are truly astounding; like an ancient Mount Rushmore. The interesting thing about the “treasury building” is that archaeologists aren’t entirely sure what its purpose was. In fact, it has been touted as a tomb, treasury or bandits’ hideout. Unlike in the Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, there is no interior so tomb is the most widely accepted explanation.Tomb of AaronNext up has to be the fascinating Tomb of Aaron which is perched on top of the aptly named Jabal Harun or Aaron’s Mountain. A fairly simple structure compare to the wonders of Petra it is supposedly the burial place of Moses’ brother Aaron. This idea resulted in a 14th-century mosque being built near the site.The MonasteryUnfortunately, for those who don’t fancy a fairly rigorous 800 hand-cut step climb up the side of the valley, you’ll miss out on my favorite site in Petra. The fabulous Ad-Deir “Monastery” is built in the Greek style so common to Petra. It was built in the 1st century BC when Nabatean prosperity was at its peak; as they generated vast amounts of wealth due to their strategic position along the trade routes from Asia, Egypt and the Roman Empire. It is 50 meters wide and 45 meters high so you can’t miss it.These are just some of the spectacular sites you can expect to be faced with if you visit this ancient and deserted city. It is recommended that you set aside a few days so you can explore the wonders of Petra at your leisure. There are Roman ruins including a 3,000 seat theatre, Egyptian style obelisks as well as other temples and alters along the winding streets.Petra at NightIt is worth returning to Petra at night to see the evening show. During the evenings they light the Treasury lit up with luminarias and have musicians who play local music. It is a separate ticket, but that also keeps the size of the crowd smaller. ShoppingIf you’re one of those people who has to know everything about what they see then why not amuse yourself in one of the two on-site museums, whilst your partner browses one of the many stalls set up by locals where you can buy hand-made crafts.  As wonderful as Petra is in the day, I highly recommend enjoying the city at night either on a walking tour or a donkey ride. This is a great option for those seeking a bit of romance out of the hot sun. ConclusionAll-in-all by the end of your trip, you’ll know why Petra is frequently referred to as the Eighth Wonder of the Ancient World. Even if you are backpacking Jordan and don’t have a big budget, this is a destination you should splurge and see!This article is provided by No.1 Traveller, a luxury travel company, who run http://www.no1traveller.com/heathrow-airport-lounge-terminal-3.htm as well as an http://www.no1traveller.com/gatwick-airport-lounges.htmShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/tokyo-itinerary-3-days/,Tokyo Itinerary – 3 Days (with 4 Day and 5 Day options),Japan,"Tokyo is a large city so you can save some money on getting around and some of your precious vacation time by organizing your trip before you go. Let me suggest a Tokyo Itinerary in 3 days (or 4 or 5 days) based on our last family trip to Tokyo.We start by splitting the city into east and west and started by tackling the western part of the Yamanote Line which is the railroad loop line in central Tokyo.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Day 1 – Shibuya, Harajuku, ShinjukuShibuya CrossingMeiji Jingu Shrine – HarajukuTakeshita Street – HarajukuOmotesandō Street – ShibuyaDay 2 – Asakusa, AkihabaraNakamise Shopping Street – AsakusaSensoji Temple – AsakusaAsahi Beer Headquarters Building – SumidaAkihabaraUeno Park – TaitōDay 3 – OdaibaMori Building Digital Art MuseumOdaiba MuseumsOdaiba SightsDay 4 OptionsMariCarTokyo Imperial Palace GardensDay 5 – Day Trip – KamakuraRainy Day ActivitiesDay 1 – Shibuya, Harajuku, ShinjukuShibuya CrossingWe started our trip with a private guided tour with Maddy from CityUnscripted. CityUnscripted had offered us a tour and we find that when we start our trip by spending time with a local we can get more out of it. This can be a great way to get oriented to a country, especially a country like Japan where some of the customs, language, and religion can seem quite foreign.We met Maddy outside the Shibuya subway station at the famous Shibuya Crossing, which I first saw in the movie “Lost In Translation”. It does seem odd that a busy crosswalk would be a popular tourist destination. One thing that has changed since my last visit here is that there is now an observation platform on the roof of the 109 Men’s store. The platform was free during our visit but the expectation is that there will be a fee sometime in the future.Right outside the subway is another photo spot which is the Hachikō Statue. This is the famous dog who always waited faithfully for his master to come home via the subway that was made into the American movie “Hachi: A Dog’s Tale”.We took a quick walk through Omoide Yokocho (aka Piss Alley) which is a couple of blocks of small bars and food stalls near the west gate of Shinjuku station. When I say small I mean like 6 people at a time small. The area is lively at night but deserted in the morning.What is open and worth a stop is the basement of the Tokyu Food Show and its amazing collection of food counters. You can pick up something for lunch or grab a late breakfast here. Also worth noting is in the Japanese food culture you can pay an amazing amount of money for food of exceptional quality. One stall, for instance, had a cantaloupe suitable for giving as a gift that cost 14,040 yen or around $129.Meiji Jingu Shrine – HarajukuFrom Shibuya get on the JR train to Harajuku station (2min ¥140) for a visit to the Meiji Jingu Shrine. This shrine is dedicated to Emperor Meiji who wrested control back from the Shogun in 1868 after over 2 and a half centuries of Shogun rule of Japan. Emperor Meiji then led the modernization of Japan. Japan would be a very different country without this ruler.Visiting your first Shinto shrine is one of those times when it is particularly helpful to have a local guide. Maddy told us about the history of the shrine and explained what was going on. She showed us, for example, how to use the water at the entrance of the shrine to ceremonially wash: wash the left hand, then the right, then your lips and then the handle of the water dipper itself.Another protocol thing to know include don’t walk through the middle of a tori gate which is reserved for deity… which you are not.There happened to be a wedding going on at the shrine when we were there. This is an active place of worship, so behave accordingly. Although “accordingly” took on a strange twist when Maddy pointed out a great number of small dents in the wood of the front of the temple. On the Hatsumode holiday (the first 3 days of the new year) the crowd at the temple sometimes got so deep that people throw offerings of money from the back of the crowd. Huh. Nowadays they put a giant swimming pool-like place in front of the main hall as a money offertory box for Hatsumode.Takeshita Street – HarajukuOpposite the Harajuku station is one of the prototypical Japanese pedestrian streets. Takeshita Street has a number of small shops carrying different clothing styles as well as chain stores, touristy shops and places selling imaginative ice cream or crepes. Maddy grew up outside of Tokyo and when she could come into the city as a teenager, this is where she came.Nonbei Yokocho – ShibuyaIf you are interested in shopping Nonbei Yokocho street is nearby and is a treelined street with high-end shops.Metropolitan Government BuildingFor a great view of Tokyo, you can go up Tokyo Tower or the Sky Tree or you can get a view for free from the Metropolitan Government Building which is near the Shinjuku station north of Harajuku. There are two observation decks on the 45th floor, one in the north tower and one in the south. The north tower also has a restaurant on the 45th floor.There is a government workers cafeteria on the 32nd floor of the north tower where you can go for a good inexpensive meal if you are willing to deal with choosing your meal from a vending machine in Japanese.Day 2 – Asakusa, Sumida, AkihabaraOn day 2 we focused on the more western side of the main loop, starting in Asakusa.Nakamise Shopping Street – AsakusaOur destination was the Sensoji Temple, but on the way, we wound our way through the Nakamise shopping street in front of it. This is an interesting area for shopping, enough so that we came back again later in our trip to spend more time in the various stores as well as the shopping from here to the Asakusa subways station.This is a pretty good area for buying souvenirs but also trying some street food, sampling some good Ramen, or finding some bargains. It feels like every time we looked up some spot in a guidebook it recommended that in front you could find a shopping/dining street, but this was one of our favorites.We came back to this area for lunch at Ippudo ramen which is a chain, but one of the top-rated Ramen places in Tokyo on TripAdvisor. Add my vote as well. Ramen on a day threatening rain is just about perfection.Sensoji Temple – AsakusaMuch of ancient Tokyo was destroyed by fire over the years, including fires started by the USA when it was bombed in WWII, so you won’t find a lot of ancient buildings from the ancient Edo period. The original Sensoji Temple was built starting in 645 AD but the current one is a re-creation built after WWII.This is a busy place. It is filled with the smell of incense, tourists and a surprising number of people in kimonos. I was going to write that if you don’t appreciate crowds then Sensoji is not the right place for you, but perhaps Tokyo itself is not the right place for you.Many visitors will donate 100 yen to get guidance from the divine oracle for their future, but we knew that our future held ramen so we had no need.Riverfront walk – AsakusaIf you head from Sensoji to the west you will come to the Sumida River. There is a small park along the banks of the river on the east side including a monument to the Great Tokyo Air Raid that destroyed the Sensoji Temple.Right by the red bridge on the Sumida River are the ferries that can take you to Odaiba later in your trip.Asahi Beer Headquarters Building – SumidaIf you have time, there are nice views of the river back towards Asakusa from the Asahi Beer Headquarters Building on the west side of the river. You can recognize the building by its stylized gold flame on the top. There is a bar on the 22nd floor of the building with some good views. Non-smokers should visit before 5:30 pm because smoking is permitted after that time.Also in Sumida and a 14-minute walk from the Asahi Beer Headquarters Building is the Tokyo Sky Tower. There is a cost to go up in the Sky Tower but it will offer greater views. AkihabaraNo visit to Tokyo is complete without at least a peek at Akihabara. You can hop on a subway or walk. It is only a 40-minute walk from Sensoji temple. This is the center of anime, manga, and electronics. It is busy and bright. Expect to be offered a flyer for a maid cafe or an owl cafe on almost every corner. If you want to be called “master” you can grab a coffee in a maid cafe. I guess you would go to an owl cafe if you want to feel like Harry Potter?We spent our time browsing for electronics and people watching. A great place to shop at least once while you are in Tokyo is a Don Quijote chain store for a Japanese shopping experience. This is a massive store that sells almost everything. The one in Akihabara also has a movie theatre.Ueno Park – TaitōJust a 15-minute walk north of Akihabara is Ueno Park. This is a large open park that will give you a break from the crowds and is also the home to the Kaneiji Temple as well as a number of museums. You can find the Tokyo National Museum, the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, the National Museum for Western Art, and the National Science Museum in the park as well as the Ueno Zoo which is Japan’s oldest zoo.Day 3 – OdaibaIn Tokyo’s s harbor there are a number of man-made islands. One of them, Odaiba, has the feel of a permanent world’s fair. You can get to Odaiba by train or via a ferry from a spot on the river near Sensoji Temple.Mori Building Digital Art MuseumThis museum was one of the best things we did in Tokyo. It is an interactive museum where artwork is being displayed on the walls but the artwork will change based on your presence or your touch. Waterfalls will flow around you, the kanji character for fire will burst into flame upon your touch. Kids (of all ages) can color in sea creatures and then watch them come to life and swim along the walls.Read more about the Mori Building Digital Art Museum and see a video.Odaiba MuseumsIn Odaiba, you will also find other hands-on, non-stuffy museums like the Miraikan – The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, the Tokyo Trick Art Museum, the Sony ExploraScience, and the Museum of Maritime Science. There is also a showcase for Toyota where you can test drive a car or see concept cars.Odaiba Sights Odaiba also has a number of shopping malls, arcades and some great public art like this statue of a Gundam (giant fighting robot) and a scale model of the Statue of Liberty.Read more Things to do in Odaiba (Tokyo) – Japan (Video #105)Day 4 OptionsFor additional days in Tokyo, there are some optional activities and sites I would consider depending on your interest.MariCarThe silliest thing we did by far in Tokyo was dressing in costume and riding go-karts through Tokyo traffic. You need an International Drivers Permit and you need to be able to follow the instructions of your guide, but it was a surprisingly great activity. We did it on a Sunday when traffic was lighter and lots of people were out who would wave at us or take pictures as we drove by.﻿﻿I have a video of the whole thing from when we were in Tokyo in December.Tokyo Imperial Palace GardensIt should be a bit of a clue that I left the Imperial Palace for a 4th day in Tokyo. You may want to skip it altogether. Except for January 2 (New Year’s Greeting) and December 23 (Emperor’s Birthday), most of the palace is closed to the public.You can take a guided tour of the palace most days but you won’t enter any of the buildings so you might save your visit to a royal palace for Kyoto if you are going there later in your trip.Another option for your 4th day would be to do a deep dive into Tokyo culture with a food tour or a cooking class.Day 5 – Day Trip – KamakuraIronically, If I had 5 days in Tokyo I would spend one day out of town. For me, that would be a day trip to Kamakura which is easily accessible via local train, about an hour from the Tokyo station. Kamakura is small today but was the countries largest city from 1200 to 1300 A.D. Here you will find some of the ancient history and UNESCO sites that Tokyo does not have including a giant Buddha dating back to 1252 A.D.You can also find beaches, a shrine where people was money to make more of it as well as, surprise surprise, some shopping/dining streets.Read more Day Trip From Tokyo – The Temples and Shrines of Kamakura, JapanRainy Day ActivitiesI would change the above schedule based on the weather. You could save Odaiba for a rainy day or the museums in Ueno Park (except the zoo), but history buffs might also consider a visit to the Edo Tokyo Museum to learn about the history of Tokyo from the Shogun time to the present. The museum is in Ryogoku next to Ryogoku station. I highly recommend taking a free tour with one of their docents. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-odaiba/,Things to do in Odaiba (Tokyo) – Japan (Video #105),Japan,"Odaiba is an island in Tokyo harbor which seems just a little bit in the future. Here are some of the amazing things to do in Odaiba.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Mori Building Digital Art MuseumMegaweb Toyota City ShowcaseOdiaba Statue of LibertyUnicorn Gundam Statue OdaibaMiraikan – The National Museum of Emerging Science and InnovationTokyo Trick Art MuseumOedo Onsen MonogatariShopping at Venus FortGetting to OdaibaTokyo Water BusMori Building Digital Art Museum﻿﻿The Mori Building Digital Art Museum is difficult to describe. Imagine if you will large rooms filled with music and with artwork projected on the walls. Now imagine that the artwork on the walls will react and change depending on your presence or touch.We started in a room where digital butterflies come to life on the walls and then fly through the rest of the 1st floor of the museum. But be careful because if you touch one of the butterflies it will drop to the ground. Or if you touch one of the flowers in the next room it will lose its pedals.The next big room had digital waterfalls coming down the walls. If you put your hand on the wall or stand nearby you can watch as the water redirects around you. Streams running down an area of raise “rock” on the floors also will redirect based on where you are.Dropping down from the ceiling were a series of Kanji characters for fire or fireworks or rainbow, etc. When someone would touch one of these characters it would explode into the appropriate display. Kids were particularly fascinated and you could watch them patiently wait for one of these characters to drop into their reach or eagerly jump to reach it as it dropped.One room would have strands of lights hanging from the ceiling that would pulse in different patterns that one of the guests was choosing from a console. Other rooms would have rays of light streaming out like a giant disco or hanging glowing lamps that would change color as you walk through.The hallways would have spectral soldiers or bunny rabbits marching along. The rabbits would stop and turn towards you if you touch them.The second floor turns up the level of interactivity to 11. There are places where big kids of all ages can bounce or climb or little kids can push balls that change color. Under your feet, there are colorful wales or hand-drawn alligators that would squish if you stepped on one.One of the areas on the second floor that was extremely popular with kids was an area where you could color in one of a series of sea creatures. You could then take your art to one of the staff who would scan it in and add it to the virtual aquarium on the walls of the room. To complete the tableau you have to add kids running to the wall to point out and follow their creatures.This amazing museum can get quite crowded on weekends and on holidays. I suggest getting tickets ahead of time and preferably visiting during a weekday. Allow at least 3 hours.Megaweb Toyota City ShowcaseToyota shows off some of its latest cars as well as some of their ideas for future vehicles in the Megaweb Toyota City Showcase in Palette Town right next to the Mori Building. This is a large area that car buffs should not miss. There are displays of historic cars, concept cars and even the chance to test drive cars. To take part in a test drive you must show a Japanese Driver’s License or International Driving Permit.Odaiba Statue of LibertyNo, you are not seeing things. Odaiba has a scaled-down replica of the Statue of Liberty that sits just off a walkway in front of the Rainbow Bridge. If you look at some of the tourist pictures it appears to be massive, but it is only 40 feet tall, 1/7 the size of the one in New York Harbor. But your friends at home don’t need to know that. This statue was built in 1998 as a temporary art installation to celebrate relations with the country of France. It was taken down again about a year later but was returned in 2000 because of public outcry about the loss of the popular photo spot.Unicorn Gundam Statue OdaibaThe other popular statue in Odaiba is the Unicorn Gundam statue in front of Diver City. I called it a transformer but that just shows how little I know of Japanese anime. This 65 foot (19.7 meters) tall statue is from an entirely different franchise of fighting robots.Miraikan – The National Museum of Emerging Science and InnovationKaty from untoldmorsels.com writes:If you are looking for things to do in Japan with kids, you can step into the future at Miraikan, a museum devoted to innovation and science where you can talk to a robot and enter a space station. Opened in 2001, you can spend a few hours at the museum enjoying its interactive exhibits designed to engage kids, young and old. Miraikan is organized into 3 sections – Discover Your Earth, Create Your Future and Explore the Frontiers – and all the exhibits have descriptions in English as well as Japanese. Weave your way through a physical representation of the internet, map out scenarios showing the impact of climate change and even check out an astronaut’s bathroom. The highlight of your visit is watching one of the regular shows by Asimo, a humanoid and eerily lifelike robot who explains how machines like him will be a huge part of our future. A huge globe known as Geo-Cosmos spins slowly overhead displaying near real time events of global weather patterns and ocean temperatures. Keep an eye out for their temporary exhibitions. When we visited you could help solve a virtual crime with a Manga character.Tokyo Trick Art MuseumEmily from kidsandcompass.com writes:If you want to do something lighthearted that’s just good, silly fun then you need to go to Tokyo Trick Art Museum in Odaiba.Head to DECKS Tokyo Beach mall, out by Tokyo Bay and the Rainbow Bridge, and you’ll find the Trick Art Museum on the 4th Floor of the Seaside Mall, through a fantastic street set out as 1950s Tokyo.You’re going to want to go with a group – the more people, the better – and definitely don’t forget your camera, or a sense of humor.Inside the museum you’ll find often comic pictures on the walls for you to pose and interact with (there’s a helpful guide to show you what to do by each picture). The “trick” part of the museum’s name comes from the differences in perspective in the scenes which make you become part of the action. You can then, of course, capture the visual trick on camera!The first part of the museum is based around the Edo period, so there are traditional scenes being played out. The next section is more fantastical with monsters, dinosaurs and characters from Japanese myths and legends represented.You need to play around with the angles to get the photos to look just right, but this museum is great fun for families or groups of friends, as you can make yourselves look as silly as you like.Tickets for the Tokyo Trick Art Museum cost 1000Y for adults and 600Y for kids aged 4+.Oedo Onsen MonogatariHelen from differentville.com writes:Visiting an onsen (a hot spring bath) is on the must-do list of many visitors to Japan and, Oedo Onsen Monogatari on Odaiba is Tokyo’s biggest and, probably most tourist-friendly, one to visit.Arrive, pay the entrance fee (from Y2720 for an adult) and choose the pretty yukata robe you’ll wear as you wander around the outside foot baths and the eating and entertainment areas. Be warned though when you get into the bath area proper (which are segregated by gender), you’re going in naked with only a towel slightly bigger than a face flannel to spare your blushes.This is where you ‘ll further appreciate Oedo Onsen as the types of minerals in some of the baths change the water color and, slipping nonchalantly in the milky white Bath of Silk (after a soapy scrub in the washroom first) partially hides you as you soak.You’ll soon realize no-one but you cares that you’re naked; now stride confidently out to the outdoor bath and get on with the more important business of soaking your cares away.Oedo Onsen opens from 11am-9am the next morning making it a great thing to do in Tokyo in the early morning.Note, like many onsens in Japan, Oedo Onsen doesn’t allow in people with tattoos.Danila from travellingdany.com writes:Odaiba island has so much to offer, but there’s one thing you should add to your Japan itinerary if you want to grasp a feel of the area. Enjoy a cappuccino with Hello Kitty! Café de Miki with Hello Kitty, an official Sanrio-themed café, is located in Diver City, one of the large shopping centers in Odaiba. Many people head over to Hello Kitty’s theme park, so this small café is never overly crowded.They do have a tasty range of Hello Kitty themed pancakes and treats, that you can enjoy sitting next to a huge “life-size” Hello Kitty plush doll. It’s absolute paradise for lots of instagrammers who come here to take pictures of the British decor. Why British? Well, actually according to the local stories, Hello Kitty is English and was born as a Brit in a suburb near London. So at Café de Miki you’ll find scones in the menu, as well as posters of London red buses and British royal soldiers everywhere.Prices are average, and the place is quiet enough to allow you to enjoy a late breakfast or a light lunch without having to push through the crowds.Taking photos is perfectly acceptable, but if you’re planning to take pictures of the staff, it’s always polite to ask them first.Shopping at Venus FortLena from socialtravelexperiment.com writesIf you happen to be in Odaiba on a rainy day or if you are looking for a place to escape the heat for a few hours a visit to Venus Fort might be just right for you.This shopping mall looks like a Renaissance Italian city square with fountains, statues and white marble columns. The sky changes regularly from bright blue to an afternoon pink with clouds moving over your head, so you really feel as if you time traveled from Japan today to Italy a hundred years ago.You can find a wide variety of Japanese clothing and accessories brands as well as restaurants.But don’t worry, if you are not so much into shopping the Venus Fort has more to offer. You can, for example, visit History Garage a free exhibition of vintage cars. Walking around this area will transport you back into the beginning of the 20th century in Japan with a lot of love for detail including old cameras, coca cola bottles, and plastic dishes in the fake restaurant windows.I would add that while you are there check out the pancakes at Shounan Pancakes. Yum.Getting to OdaibaTokyo Water BusYou can easily get to Odaiba via train but can also reach the island via ferry service. I recommend taking the subway there because you will have great views of the Rainbow Bridge and of the Tokyo harbor but then take the ferry back because especially the sleek modern ferry looks just a bit in the future.Tickets can be purchase from the waterfront on the north end of the island facing the Rainbow Bridge. You can take the ferry as far as Asakusa near the Sensoji Temple.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/what-to-do-in-tokyo-in-december/,What to do in Tokyo in December (Video #104),Japan,"We were at the Senso-ji Temple in Tokyo and I was miserable. It was raining but not just a gentle summer rain, it was freezing rain and I was definitely not dressed for it. But then something surprising happened. The temperature dropped just a few more degrees and the freezing rain turned into snow and the scene went from miserable to magical just that quickly.Visiting the city in the winter has some challenges, but also has some rewards, particularly visiting Tokyo in December when the city dresses up for a holiday that it doesn’t celebrate.WeatherMy experience with freezing rain is not a typical winter day in Tokyo which has a mild climate. The average highs are 53°F / 12°C and the average lows only 39°F / 3°C. The typical snowfall in Tokyo in December… is nothing. The city gets less than 2 inches of snow a year and most of that in February.In the snowstorm I saw in February, Tokyo got an inch of snow and the city shut down. The trains that are above ground stopped running and the highways snarled. They just are not used to snow.Christmas MarketsJason Jenkins from AnEpicEducation.com writes:With only 1% of the Japanese population professing to be Christians, you’d think that there would be little interest in the Christmas holiday. Visit Tokyo in December, however, and you’ll see a city in full holiday mode. There are numerous Christmas markets across the city, replete with carolers, German pastries and mulled wine.Christmas IlluminationsCorinne Vail from Reflections Enroute writes:Tokyo has a cure for the winter darkness, and it’s bright and beautiful. By December the city decorates with lights, and even Christmas trees, with a gusto. These illuminations have become events to take your dates, your kids, your elders for a night on the town. The light shows are often accompanied by music, Christmas market vendors, and have become something everyone looks forward to each and every year.Businesses have invested time, money, and lots of energy into hiring technical wizards who match the lights to the music. At the Caretta Shiodome, the show begins again every 15 minutes highlighting the theme, which last December was Disney princess songs. The crowds ooh and awe, snapping away photos for their Instagram. There are full tours to take you around to the various illuminations so you don’t have to drive and try and find a parking spot, but taking the metro is quick and easy as well.Illumination shows are advertised in all online magazines, and the tourist information center can recommend some favorites. Also, every hotel concierge will tell you which ones they prefer. Hang out in Tokyo this December to brighten your wintry spirits.Jason Jenkins from AnEpicEducation.com writes:Where Japan excels most in the Christmas spirit is in illuminations. All across the city, various neighborhoods, shopping malls, and urban centers have decked their halls with millions of LED lights. Sure, there are Christmas trees, ice-skating and the occasional Santa Claus here and there, but one of our family’s favorite things to do each December is to check out the Christmas illuminations. Roppongi Hills usually has great lights, as does the riverside near Naka-Meguro, which in years past went electric blue. The Shiodome area near the Caretta Building usually goes all-out, with light shows every 15 minutes set to musical accompaniment. Our favorite, however, are the lights around Tokyo Dome City, next to the stadium. They’re a little less modern in years past, but bright enough for great nighttime pics, and then we can ride the carousel in the amusement area next door.MariCarWith MariCar you can dress up in costume and drive through the streets of Tokyo like you were in Super Mario Kart (except you can’t through banana peels and there is real traffic). If this sounds like a silly thing to do you are right. But it was also laugh out loud fun and the favorite activity that my family did. People wave at you like you are a celebrity. It is a 2-hour drive. Watch this (sped up) video for more info:﻿﻿We did this in early December and it was not too cold to do, but I do have these suggestions:Drive on a Sunday. Traffic will be lighter and there will be more kids and tourists on the streets who will delight in seeing you and wave.Wear an extra layer like a sweatshirt below your costume to stay warm.Bring your smartphone as you will want to take photos when you are stopped safely at a traffic light. There is a pouch where you can store your phone.Wear gloves that let you operate a smartphone. Your hands will get cold.Consider wearing goggles. They will also help your costume hood stay on.Consider renting a Go Pro or bringing your own if you want to have videos of your drive. See my video for what you will get.Mori Digital Art MuseumThe Mori Digital Art Museum is fun at any time of year but it is definitely something to keep in mind if you have a day when you need an indoor activity, especially a weekday when the lines are shorter.The museum is located on Odaiba, an island in Tokyo’s harbor. It is difficult to describe what the museum is because it is not like any art museum I have ever seen. If the museum has it a motto it is “please touch”. You walk through room-size art displays where you can interact with the art. You can stand in a digital waterfall and watch it redirect around you. If you step on the projection of a salamander on the ground you will squish it. You can even draw your own fish and then watch it come to life and swim along the walls.Edo Tokyo MuseumIf you have a day where the weather is not great for outdoor activities and you are a fan of history then I recommend a visit to the Ed Tokyo Museum next to Ryogoku station that shows what Tokyo was like in the time of the Shogunate and how it has changed over time. There are models of what the old palace looked like as well as recreations of the Nihonbashi Bridge, a kabuki theatre and the first western-style houses which were built in the heart of the city.We took advantage of a free tour given by one of the docents and it was amazing. We got much more out of our visit following our knowledgable guide around the place.CostI have found deals as much as 50% off hotel rooms in Tokyo in winter. They get more crowds in the summer and frankly I will take the December weather over the August weather. On our latest trip we have hotel rooms in December for around $115 for a double and in late November a 5 person room at a hostel for about $43 a person. That’s not cheap, but it is cheaper than a lot of major metropolitan cities. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-tokyo-at-night/,Things To Do in Tokyo at Night,Japan,"On a grey day in November Tokyo like our most recent trip to Tokyo, the sun sets at 4:30 pm so even people who are not night owls will want to know things to do in Tokyo at night. As we prepared for our trip my wife laughed that every neighborhood seemed to be described as a cute shopping street with restaurants. Many of the suggestions that fellow travel bloggers gave me were eating, drinking and shopping and tall places where you could look down on the places to eat and drink and shop.Things To Do in Tokyo at NightTable of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Places to Eat and Drink and ShopYurakucho ShimbashiShinjukuTokyo’s Robot Restaurant (Shinjuku)Takeshita Street (Harajuku)Places to get a Great ViewMetropolitan Government BuildingTokyo TowerRoppongi Hills Mori TowerShibuya CrossingHelicopter RideSensoji TempleOther Things to Do at NightTeamlab Borderless Mori Digital Art MuseumYakatabune River CruiseTokyo Disney SeaMariCarBaseballPlaces to Eat and Drink and ShopWhile places like Pissing Alley next to Shibuya with its tiny bars and restaurants (some of which will only hold 5 people) are well known, many different neighborhoods around the city have small restaurant filled back alleys. We stayed close to the Edo Museum and ate our first night at one of these local restaurants which specialized in gyoza. It didn’t have English menus and didn’t have a table large enough for 5 people. So try the well-known places below but also check the neighborhood around where you are staying for small cheap good restaurants and bars.Yurakucho ShimbashiJason Jenkins from AnEpicEducation.com writes:When most people visit Tokyo, they don’t think of the Yurakucho/Shimbashi area for sightseeing. True, during daylight hours, this business district is not action-packed. Once the sun sets, however, the streets and alleyways around the office towers light up with neon and the glow of fires from outdoor grills. Here you’ll find a wide variety of cuisine: from exquisite kaiseki and shabu shabu to greasy-spoon ramen and gyoza joints. Thousands of office workers leave their desks and head straight to tables set up on the sidewalks.My favorite strip of eateries and watering holes follows one of Tokyo’s most well-known train lines. The JR Yamanote Line runs a circular route through downtown Tokyo on elevated tracks about three to five meters above street level. Thanks to lower real estate values, loads of restaurants and bars have opened shops underneath the tracks. Simply follow the trains from Yurakucho to Shimbashi Stations (or vice versa) and you’ll encounter all manner of interesting establishments. You’ll find high-end Korean cuisine next to a hole-in-the-wall Thai place with a line out the door. Not far away you’ll find top-shelf sushi next to a dusty alley of family-run six-seater izakaya. Turnover is high, and with so many places to choose from you’ll be able to find good grub fast. Or just go for a cocktail and the people watching. Either way, you’ll see a side of Japan few visitors experience.ShinjukuPari Alva from traveling-pari.com writes:Shinjuku, at night, is a treat for the eyes as all the buildings are brightly lit up. There’s an abundance of bars, restaurants, maid café and shops that will entertain you. However, you must keep your wits about you in the Kabukicho area. This area is a shadier part of Tokyo, so if you walk the streets late at night you may be hustled by people into their hostess bars that charge a lot of money. One of the famous draws for tourists in this area is the Robot Restaurant. In keeping with the seedy theme of Kabukicho, this restaurant has stage shows featuring robots and semi-clad girls. Also, don’t miss Godzilla peeping over the tower of Hotel Gracery at Godzilla street. The statue lights up and moves every few minutes and smoke bellows out of its mouth to mimic fire. A better area to visit in Shinjuku is Golden Gai, known for its traditional bars and restaurants. However, the catch is that some, not all, of these bars and restaurants are only open to local Japanese people. A good sign that the bar is open to visitors is to look if they have posted an English menu outside the restaurant.Tokyo’s Robot Restaurant (Shinjuku)Allan Wilson from live-less-ordinary.com writes:Found within the bright neon and flashing lights of Shinjuku, Tokyo’s Robot Restaurant is a must for Tokyo Nightlife, and for me, it has to be one of the most marvelous shows in the world. And while Tokyo is well known for its themed cafes, the sheer extravagance and expense (it’s rumored to have cost near 10 billion yen – $90,000,000), makes you wonder why they even risked such a thing in the first place. But I can’t think of a better way to spend a night in Tokyo, and while the show does seem geared somewhat towards the Otaku subcultures (Tokyo’s Nerds), it no doubt captures a wider audience with its outlandishness and fun of it all.﻿The show itself follows epic battles pitting robots versus beasts, often with scantily clad cosplay girls, lots of flashing lights, and just a lot of madcap goings-on in between. Like pandas riding cows. Although the performances do change quite regularly, so you can just expect anything really. Anyway, it is something you must see for yourself to understand, and tickets are easily found online, but best bought in advance (around 6,000 Yen). Food-wise then, while it is known as a restaurant, there’s really only bento boxes on the menu, as well as alcohol. And alcohol would probably best suit the occasion.I will admit that when my family was just in Tokyo we skipped the Robot Cafe. as a lot of the reviews made it sound like Chuck E. Cheese’s on steroids (or on LSD as Allan wrote). Allan’s video does make it seem a bit more interesting but still loud.Takeshita Street (Harajuku)Sally Lucas from our3kidsvtheworld.com writes:Takeshita Street, Harajuku in Tokyo is a pedestrian shopping street lined with fashion boutiques, cafes, and restaurants. Takeshita Street comes alive at night time, the street is only about 400m long but has over 100 different and funky little stores. If you’re not keen on crowds, I suggest you visit during the daytime. Harajuku is a very popular district with international tourists and with Japanese tourists visiting Tokyo on school trips. It’s located close to Shibuya and Shinjuku and is famous for Japan’s most extreme teenage cultures and fashion icons, however, there is something for everyone on Takeshita St.Located directly across the street from the JR East Harajuku Station, you can’t miss it right next to the multi-level GAP store. Harajuku is popular for all things ‘kawaii’ meaning cute in Japanese. Make sure you sample a crepe at one of the window front stores and the kids will enjoy the lolly and cotton candy store. We did much of our souvenir shopping here, with many vendors lining the street with reasonably priced souvenirs. After you have finished in Takeshita Street the Meiji Shrine or the Oriental Bazaar is only a short walk away.Places to Get a Great ViewMetropolitan Government BuildingSylvia Van Overvelt from wapititravel.com writes:There are several observation platforms in Tokyo. One can argue about which one has the best views on Tokyo’s impressive skyline but one thing is for sure, the views from the Metropolitan Government Building are the cheapest. Both observation decks, one located in the Northern tower of the building, the other located in the Southern tower, can be visited for free. Both of them are located at a height of 202 meters and offer similar views. On a clear day, you will be able to spot famous landmarks such as Mt. Fuji and the Tokyo Skytree. At night the views over the city are just as spectacular. It’s one of the best places to visit in Tokyo if you want to see the city from above.The Southern observatory deck houses a café and the Northern observatory houses a restaurant open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.It’s easy to reach the Metropolitan Government Building with the metro or the train. The Tochomae stop of the Oedo Subway Line (Toei) is located directly underneath the building. From Tokyo’s central Shinjuku station, it is a 10-minute walk to the Metropolitan Government Building. Shinjuku station is served by several JR lines and both Tokyo Metro and Toei lines. To get to the building take the West exit of the station.Tokyo TowerNancy from ensquaredaired.com wrote:The Tokyo Tower is a prominent landmark in Tokyo and is a place that is worth visiting at night. This tower was built in the 1950s as a way to symbolize its growth as a global economic power postwar and is mainly for tourism and communication purposes. Indeed, it was inspired by the Eiffel tower in Paris and is often used as a backdrop in anime and movies. In fact, at 333 meters high, the Tokyo Tower is actually 13 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  Once there, you can pay to visit the main deck of the Tower, which offers a great view of the city. There are also many souvenir shops and cafes for visitors. If you’re lucky and you’re visiting the Tokyo Tower on a clear day, you might be able to catch a glimpse of Mount Fuji from afar. Another great way to see the Tokyo Tower is by Mario Kart or by foot at night. Walking (or driving) towards the structure is just as entertaining and will not cost you a dime.  Roppongi Hills Mori TowerChristopher Mitchell from travelingmitch.com writes: Tokyo at night is a real feast for the senses, but I’d argue that to truly experience Tokyo at night, you need get some perspective, and, in my humble opinion, that means getting some elevation.  Enter the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, a fifty-four story skyscraper in Roppongi which happens to be the sixth tallest building in the city, and Tokyo is a city full of skyscrapers. At night in particular, it has a particular allure which suggests that it could quite easily be used as the set for Gotham City.  While the Roppongi Hills Tower is predominantly what amounts to beautiful office space, there is a considerable area that serves as a tourist beacon. Firstly, the Mori Arts Centre and Arts Museum, located on the 53rd floor, was surprisingly good. When I was there, some five years ago, they had an exhibit on by the Japanese the 18th and 19th century artist Utagawa Kuniyoshi, and it changed the way that I conceptualized Japanese art and anime art in general.  The real experience that Roppongi Hills Mori Tower offers are the lookouts. There are bars, restaurants, and areas to take in the view on both the 52nd floor and the 54th floor, and it’s well worth it. It’s hard to conceptualize the real size of Tokyo unless you’ve got a view like this. Whether you go to the museum or not, it’s still worth it to come up to wither of these floors for a drink.  It’s one thing to see Tokyo at night from street level, and another thing altogether to take in the whole city with one glance.Shibuya CrossingKristin Addis from bemytravelmuse.com writes:Shibuya Crossing is one of those touristy things in Tokyo that truly is worth doing. The crossing is exactly what it sounds like – a crosswalk. However, this is no ordinary crosswalk. It swells with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people all crossing an intersection at the same time. It looks amazing from above and it’s a fun experience when you’re in the thick of it. I also like that it’s free, easy to reach, is located right outside Shibuya station, and is a great photo op. It’s bright, it’s energetic, and it’s a true Tokyo experience. I recommend going at dusk and watching as the lights come on, particularly around rush hour when it’s likely to be full of people. You can watch from the sidelines, then jump into the action and ask a friend to take a long exposure photo of you while the crowd walks by. Don’t worry about being in the way – simply step to the side of the major crosswalks – all lanes of traffic stop so it’s safe – and hold still while people pass by. Don’t worry, you won’t be the only one doing it. You can also enjoy the view from the deck of Fatburger restaurant’s observation deck, or from the windows of the famous Starbucks right on the crossing.Helicopter RideMichael Turtle from timetravelturtle.com writes:There are some great viewpoints in Tokyo where you can see the city at night – but none of them is nearly as high as the view you get from a helicopter.One of the most thrilling experiences in Tokyo at night is to take off in a chopper and circle the center of the city. As you fly over the skyscrapers, you’ll see the neon lights flashing and the headlights of the cars moving across the city. The main Tokyo station glows with shinkansen coming in and out, Shinjuku is a ball of color, and Tokyo Skytree stands out against everything else.It’s a very special perspective that most people will never experience. It’s also really interesting to see how Tokyo is laid out and how close to the water the downtown actually is! It gives you a new way to look at such an incredible city.Doing a helicopter ride above Tokyo at night is also more affordable than you might expect. The price will depend on exactly how many people are in your group, but it’s about US$200 a person for a 15-minute ride. All the helicopter companies leave from the Tokyo Heliport which is near Shin-Kiba station.Sensoji TempleAlex Waltner from swedishnomad.com writes:“Sensoji Temple is one of the most famous temples in Japan, and one of the most visited attractions in Tokyo. Next to it you also have Nakamise Dori, which is a vibrant shopping street filled with great souvenirs and sweets. This shopping street is said to have been around since the early 1700s.Sensoji Temple is located in the historic district of Asakusa, and it’s the oldest temple in Tokyo. It was founded already in 645 AD. Next to the temple, you can also see the impressive five-story pagoda, also known as the Asakusa Shrine.At night, you can see the temple and pagoda being illuminated, which shouldn’t be missed while visiting. It’s easy to get here as well, just go to Asakusa station via subway or train, and walk 5 minutes. In the surroundings, you will find lots of restaurants, ranging from budget to more exquisite dining options.The best time to visit is somewhere before sunset so that you can see the temple and pagoda in daylight as well. It’s truly stunning, so allow some 30 minutes or so before sunset to see the temple and pagoda. Nakamise Dori really comes to live in the evening, so I would suggest walking around the shopping street afterward.If you need to buy souvenirs, this is a great place to do so, even though it’s a bit touristy. However, you will find everything about Japan here, and there are some stalls providing quality products as well.”Other Things to Do at NightTeamlab Borderless Mori Digital Art MuseumCorinne Vail at ReflectionsEnroute.com writes:One of the hottest things to do in Tokyo is to visit the Teamlab Borderless Mori Digital Art Museum in Odaiba. Using digital animation, you walk through galleries utilizing top technological systems to create scenes, worlds, animals, growth, many different worlds. These worlds, through movement, are able to shift from one place to another, as humans do. The vibrant colors, animations, and sounds provide continual entertainment and a sense of awe and imagination.Each room provides a completely different sense of interaction, a conglomeration of sight, sound, and touch. Moving on from being mainly a spectator, the top floor is reserved for the Athletic Forest, where children and adults alike, take off their shoes and run, slide, push balloons, climb metal trees, color sheets, and other hands-on interactions.It’s easy to reach the Mori Digital Art Museum by subway, and it’s much better to go first thing in the morning or during dinner time until closing as it is such a popular event that it is difficult to get in or if you do get in, you want to go when the crowds are smaller. Tickets can be purchased online here.Don’t miss this fantastic Tokyo activity, and experience the joy of digital animation with all your senses.Yakatabune RiverAbigail King from insidethetravellab.com writes:Ever since Japan’s 17th century Edo period, civilized patrons would relax of an evening by gliding along the Sumida River in a traditional Yakatabune Boat.Today, you can follow in their footsteps – or add a distinctly more modern vibe by joining a karaoke version filled to the brim with vocal locals or “salarymen.”The Sumida River has enough landmarks to keep you entertained, but not so many that you feel torn between looking outside and getting your groove on. There’s the aptly named Rainbow Bridge, dripping in blue, yellow and red, and you’ll also pass the SkyTree Observatory.The Yakatabune are low, slow boats, with lines upon lines of windows, so there’s no need to jostle for the view. They come with traditional tatami mats and a range of dining options organized in advance. Along with tempura and sashimi, expect the alcohol to flow freely. Sake, shochu, and beer slosh freely, which does at least help with the social expectation to join in the karaoke. Get ready to get barefoot and dine cross-legged, too, as that’s all part of the experience.I was the sole foreign traveler on mine, and the sole woman, at that, but ended up with some of the warmest, funniest memories of my trip.Tokyo Disney SeaThais Saito from worldtripdiaries.com writes:One of the best things about Tokyo Disney is that they offer the Twilight Pass. It’s a more affordable entry ticket that allows people to enter the park after 3 pm.Tokyo Disney is pretty great, and you’ll definitely need more than 2 days to see both parks but if you only want a taste of it, take some pretty photos, or you’re on a tight budget, this is the perfect ticket. Disney at night, when the sky darkens but all the lights turn on, is magical. It becomes a different place. The evening parades (like the Electrical Parade) are astonishing, and the projections on the castle and the fireworks also only happen at night.During the last hour of the park, the lines for most rides are shorter, but be quick because they close up the lines around 30 minutes before the park closing time. It’s worth it even during winter when park opening hours are shorter, but during summer, when the heat is unbearable in the afternoon, it’s perfect for everyone and a great thing to do in Tokyo with kids!MariCarBen McLaughlin from horizonunknown.com writes:Tokyo at night is full of busy streets and colorful, bright lights. There’s no better way of exploring this illuminated city than driving a motorized go-kart. Taking the wheel of an automatic kart is an exciting experience, anyone searching for an adrenaline boost in Tokyo – this is for you!Just like the computer game Mario Kart, there are multiple courses to choose from, with most starting from the main shop in Akihabara. Visiting Tokyo Tower by driving there is an unforgettable memory from Tokyo!You even get to choose your character. Throw on the onesie of your favorite Mario Kart character (or choose from many more to pick from) and zip around the streets of Tokyo!While these karts get up to speeds of 60 km/hr, safety is a huge point and every vehicle is maintained and complies with all laws. All you need is a valid driver’s license and an international driver’s permit (you do need both to be able to drive). While it is safe, you are driving on the main roads with real cars, so take your time and observe regular traffic laws.If you’re after a thrilling and unique way to experience Tokyo at night, check out MariCar!Night BaseballMy college friend Dave writes:I went to a Yomiuri Giants game while in Tokyo. The Tokyo Dome was rocking, with fans continually cheering and singing, very similar to supporters sections at big soccer matches. Every seat was full and plenty of standing room spots were available right when the doors opened, but fifteen minutes later, many spots were taken or “reserved” by placing a newspaper on the floor.https://photos.smugmug.com/Asia/Japan/Tokyo-Japan/i-ThxjCxL/0/7bf32304/1280/IMG_1222-1280.mp4The food was a variety of Japanese snacks, bento boxes, candy, and popcorn. There are cheerleaders and mascots on the field, and people waving giant flags everywhere. During batting practice, foul balls and home runs are retrieved, and not kept by the fans, so no need to bring a glove. I would advise getting there early to enjoy the amusement park next to the Dome, stopping at the Shake Shack on the outside of the Dome, and going to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum near Shake Shack. If you have a reserved seat, there is no need to go in right when the Dome opens, but a SRO ticket will get you a better spot if you go in very early, and bring a newspaper.  Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/10-points-interest-osaka-not-missed/,"10 Points of Interest In Osaka, Japan Not To Be Missed",Japan,"Osaka is the third biggest city in Japan. However, unlike other travel destinations located in Japan, there are not as many points of interest in Osaka, which is why it is not as popular as Tokyo or Kyoto. This place is more known as a business city. It is also known for its food.However, in this post I will try to change your idea about this city, tell about the best, unknown ways to explore Osaka and show you that this place is clearly undervalued by tourists!1. Osaka Castle and Osaka Castle ParkOsaka Castle is one of the main sights in Osaka and, in my opinion, is a majestic and beautiful building. It is a classical representative of Japanese architecture. Inside the castle, there is a museum and observation deck. Inside, you can see clothes and military armor of samurai from different eras, and explore the history of the empire and the imperial family. The view from the observation deck is impressive. I advise you to go up there.The Osaka Castle Park is located right next to the castle and it is another good destination for tourists. it is big, calm, and very beautiful. Here you can admire many beautiful trees and sculptures. There are many cherry and plum trees in the park, so it is especially impressive in spring. There is a moat with water around the castle where you can ride on a boat.2. Kaiyukan AquariumThe Kaiyukan Aquarium is one of the largest aquariums in the world. It has lots to show you and is an exciting place to visit. The aquarium impresses with its size (8 floors) and proximity to its inhabitants – the penguins stroll almost at arm’s length. Families with kids should not miss the outdoor pool where skates and young sharks swim and  where visitors can pet them.3. Umeda Sky BuildingThe best place to view this large city is from its famous 173-meter tower – The Umeda Sky Building. This is a beautiful building that has a stunning view of the whole city. Visit around the time of sunset or a bit later. You will be amazed by the view of the city at night.4. National Bunraku TheaterIf you plan to visit some cultural sights during your Osaka tour, the National Bunraku Theater is definitely a good choice. You will not regret attending one of their plays. This theater is something odd. Here you will see many 1-meter puppets that are equipped with a mechanism that moves their eyes and mouth, and even bends their fingers. What is also interesting is that the puppeteers are not hidden behind the stage, but control the puppets right on the stage.5. Universal Studios JapanTalking about the best of Osaka, there was no way for me to avoid mentioning this stunning park that will be interesting not only for kids but also for adults. At Universal Studios Japan you can find many thematic rides, cafes, and the most famous locations and scenery from all the favorite films and cartoons created at this studio. No one will regret attending this park.6. Universal City WalkOne the road from the park itself to the JR station is  Universal City Walk. With its many hotels, stores, and cafes, City Walk gives tourists one more opportunity to plunge into the world of the favorite films and heroes. Of course, everything here is a bit pricey but it is beautiful place to spend an evening.7. DotonboriSome people say that Dotonbori is a must-visit while others claim that there is nothing to do here. My opinion is – you should visit it at least once to see it with your own eyes. It is a street in the heart of the city with lots of shops, clubs, and food, where you can have lots of fun, try unusual dishes, and just dive into the modern culture of Japan.8. Sumiyoshi Taisha ShrineSumiyoshi Taisha Shrine is a Shinto sanctuary in Osaka that is an island of silence and peace. It is located in the heart of this huge city. It fills me with peace and happiness when I visit. This is one of those places that I all love about Japan – a small and peaceful corner of paradise with nice ponds, bridges, a beautiful park, and temple that make you forget about the fast pace of life, stop for a second, and just enjoy the moment.9. Tempozan Ferris WheelThe view from Tempozan Ferris Wheel is just breathtaking. This wheel is located in a very interesting location – on one side from you are lots of tall buildings, bridges, and roads, while on the other side you can see the river and the sea.10. Ebisu BridgeEbisu is a special bridge as it is round. It connects two popular shopping streets on opposite banks of the canal and offers a great view of the river and city. It is especially beautiful in the evening when the city is full of lights.If you only have 24 hours then check out this One Day in Osaka Itinerary.PodcastFor more about what to do in Osaka and the area listen to Travel to Kyoto and the Kansai Region of Japan – Episode 540.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/5-spots-tourists-miss-kyoto/,6 Spots Tourists Miss In Kyoto,Japan,"The ancient capital of Japan, Kyoto, has a stunning number of sites to visit. There are 2,000 temple and shrines alone. Sadly most visitors miss these 6 great sites. It is also an educational hub of different western Japan universities. This is one of the few major cities in Japan that managed to escape the devastation that came with the Second World War, and its legacy when it comes to the preservation of tradition and history cannot be rivaled. Basically, you might have been all along missing great opportunities to see and learn about amazing things in the city.Here are five spots you need to make time for to enjoy the amazing sightseeing opportunities.The Kyomizu-dera TempleThe Kyomizu-dera Temple, which is located in eastern Kyoto, is a UNESCO heritage site that overlooks the city from the Otowa Mountain. As a visitor, you are able to enjoy a graceful stroll within the temple through the quaint Tea-pot Lane, which hosts small shops and craft stores. This is a good site for someone who loves keeping souvenirs and you will find awesome pieces crafted with focus on the ancient tradition of the region.At the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy, which was founded in 790 AD, you will see existing buildings that have stood since 1633 during the times of the third Tokugawa Shogun. Some of the highlights you might want to learn about include huge terrace of the Main Hall, which stands on 30-meter-tall pillars that are reinforced with five rows of beams. The venue is used to host temple dances and you will be amazed to be among the audience during such an event.Katsura Imperial VillaConstructed in 1624, the Katsura Imperial Villa was made for Prince Hachijo Toshihito, the brother of Goyozei, the emperor of the region. The design was crafted by Kobori Enshu and it was to offer a beautiful and well secured home, with the exterior and interior trims getting detailed touch that you will notice at the first arrival. It is a complete manifestation of creativity and the connection between man and architecture making it feel more like a wonder than an architectural masterpiece.There are different gardens around the villa that present a picture of the way the ancient home was decorated. It makes a perfect spot for lovers of photography and while there you will also get a chance to learn about the history of the region. This is one of the places in Kyoto that you need to consider visiting even if it does not feature among most popular destinations in the city.The Kyoto Municipal Museum of ArtApart from its various temples that are littered with imperial artworks, the Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art boasts of many awesome collections that many seldom visit. It contains some of the largest galleries and since it was established in 1928, it has helped keep some of the most important historical artifacts in the country. Its renovation in 2014 came as a rejuvenation measure that helps reflect in the past to show the historic elements that have helped shape the history of Japan as a whole.If you would like to query history, this would be an ideal location to feed with knowledge from the past, and there are experts to guide you through the various pieces of information. This is an experience that many miss but upon keen review it is one that should never be omitted in one’s travel itinerary to Kyoto.Gion’s Geishas and TemplesGion is famously known as an entertainment district and is one of the areas in Kyoto that is suited perfectly for foot exploration. Across the eastern banks of the Kamogawa River is the interesting mix of historical purity and modern architecture. You are fed both popular Japanese traditions and modern cultural pursuits that you could as well borrow if you love exploration and learning.Some of these traditions have been preserved and date as far back as the 17th century, so visiting the area marks an important stage in your life where you will get to understand the rich diversity that makes the world. That’s not all as there are also many temples each with a unique representation of culture, and these are temples drawn from different eras, which again gives you an opportunity to explore in depth the rich history the Japanese people have enjoyed for centuries.Kyoto Imperial PalaceOriginally Kyoto-gosho, which was built in AD 794, the Kyoto Imperial Palace is among sites in Kyoto that you want to see. Although the temple has undergone several rounds of renovation following destruction, the work was done carefully to ensure it retains its initial glory and beauty.While at the temple, you are given an opportunity to see some of the most important rooms within and you can ask for assistance from tour guides who help you learn about the different rooms and their significance in history and ancient Japanese governance. This is also a site that few have considered giving a try and once you make your first trip you are triggered to explore deeper into the country to understand more about its people and cultural practices, both from the past and today.Fox ShrineIf you visit the Fox Shrine in Kyoto, leave yourself some time to wander the paths around the shrine. The shrine is known for its many torii gates which you can only experience by doing some climbing up the hill.Editor: Our thanks to D. Scott Carruthers for this article.

https://amateurtraveler.com/kamakura-day-trip/,Kamakura Day Trip from Tokyo – The Great Buddha and Other Great Sites,Japan,"Tokyo is a large and busy city and if, while you are visiting it, you desire a break from its crowds and skyscrapers then I would recommend a day trip to the nearby seaside city of Kamakura. Kamakura was the political center of Japan for 150 years centered around the 1200s when the country was ruled by a Shogun who resided here. Because of its historic significance, the city is home to numerous Buddhist temples and Shinto Shrines that have been collectively declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Getting to KamakuraTsurugaoka Hachiman-gūHokokuji TempleHase-dera TempleGreat BuddhaZeniarai Benten ShrineBeachConclusionPodcastGetting to KamakuraKamakura can be reached via a local JapanRail train from Tokyo station in about an hour. Take the JR Yokosuka line which passes through Yokohama on the way to Kamakura. The cost is 920 yen one way.When you arrive at the Kamakura train station stop at the local tourism office in the train station for one of the better tourism brochures I saw in Japan. The brochure will describe all the main temples, shrines and other sites of Kamakura and locate them on a helpful map.Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gūOur first stop is Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū which is the most important Shinto Shrine in Kamakura and the heart of the city. Exit the train station and walk straight to the main street of Kamakura until you can see the large orange Tori gate of the shine in the distance off to your left. For 1000 years a ginkgo tree stood to the left of the main staircase of the shrine but fell during a storm in 2010. Many of the town festivals happen in the open area in front of the shrine. You can find numerous food stalls there.There is a small museum inside and to the left through the entrance of the shrine with items that date back to the 1200s and the Kamakura Shogunate. The entire museum can be visited in 5-10 minutes but is worth exploring.Hokokuji TempleMy recommendation for your next stop is the Hokokuji Temple and its famous and peaceful bamboo grove. The temple is located a ways to the north of the Tsurugaoka shrine and for those who don’t love walking, you might consider taking an Uber or bus to get there. If you have time, I recommend a stop for tea at the tea house on the temple grounds. The number one question people asked me when they heard I had been to this temple was “did you stop for tea?”Hase-dera TempleThere are numerous other shrines and temples near the Hokokuji Temple but for a one day trip, I am going to recommend your next stop be on the other side of town. Return to the main train station and then get on the Enoden Line train and take it 3 stations to the Hase station. As you exit the station on a sunny day you can turn left to walk to the beach or turn right to get to the Hase-dera Temple. The Hase-dera Temple has a beautiful view of Kamakura and would make a lovely picnic spot.On the grounds of the temple, one of the more unusual features is a cave that winds under the temple. The cave is filled with statues dedicated to Benzaiten, the sea goddess. The cave should be avoided by people with claustrophobia and its low ceilings were a bit challenging to someone as tall as I am.The many tiny Jizō statues on the temple grounds mourn children lost to miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion.Great BuddhaOur next stop is the Great Buddha at the Kōtoku-in Temple. This large bronze Buddha (probably) dates back to 1252. The statue used to be housed in a large building but three different buildings were destroyed by storms in 1334, 1369 and finally in the tsunami of 1498. The statue has been outside since 1498. It used to be cover with gold. The statue was featured in the poem “The Buddha at Kamakura” by Rudyard Kipling.For around 5 yen you can climb inside the giant statue. No, there is not a particularly great view but how often can you say that you patted the inside of Buddha’s belly. I have to say that as a tall person this was a bit more challenging to do.Zeniarai Benten ShrineThe last shrine I recommend visiting is the Zeniarai Benten. Up the hill from the Great Buddha is this shrine which is built around a mountain spring. Tradition holds that money washed in the spring will multiply. The name zeniarai means “coin washing”. The shrine is filled with the smell of incense and with Japanese people washing their coins and paper money in the spring.Most of Japan’s population believe in Shinto with its many shrines to a million gods and in Buddhism with the many faces of Buddha. Buddhism Temples tends to be reserved for funerals and for dealing with death. Shinto shrines tend to be where you pray for practical things like next exam or for, in this case, your money to double.BeachEven if none of the history and culture that Kamakura has will attract you, this is also a beach town. You can just go down to the beach and watch the surfers try and catch a wave.ConclusionThis is just a taste of Kamakura. You can’t possibly visit its many shrines and temples in a single day, but in a day, with a fair amount of walking, you can visit some of the more remarkable ones before you take a train back to Tokyo and your next adventure.PodcastHear more of Kamakura and my first trip there in Travel to Japan – Amateur Traveler Episode 364Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/japan-vending-machines/,Japan Vending Machines,Japan,"One of the things that I had heard about Japan before I visited there was the ubiquity of the vending machine culture, but even knowing that I was surmised by the ubiquity of vending machines and the lack of diversity at the same time.hot and cold items – japanese vending machinesHot and ColdThis picture shows one of the most common vending machines that I saw in Japan. Everything in this vending machine is a liquid but it is a combination of water, green tea, coffee drinks, juices and sodas. It is also a combination of hot drinks (labeled in red) and cold drinks (labeled in blue). I would estimate that 70% of the vending machines that I saw were of this general type. Some vending machines would also mix in soups into the. Where were all the weird and wonderful ones I had heard about?A rare vending machineVending Machines EverywhereIn Nikko, Japan I stayed at a Ryokan at the edge of town, the second to last building on the road… and there was a vending machine outside. If you stood at that machine you could see another one just like it a few houses down. But of all the vending machines I saw about 80% of them sold liquids, maybe 15% of them sold cigarettes and two sold snacks. Had I realized how relatively rare the ice cream vending machine was at the side of this picture I would have taken a picture of it. It seemed odd to me that with so many vending machines I could never get a snickers bar or a bag of Doritos, but if you are in Japan you need never die of thirst if you have enough coins and small bills.hot items – Japanese vending machinesMy FavoritesI visited Japan in the Winter so while I enjoyed the occasional cold green tea, I was more partial to the warmer drinks as I was hiking through the snow. The chocolate drinks were fine, the hot lemonade was only so-so but the hot milk tea was a favorite. Some drinks are labeled in Japanese only so you may be left guessing at the contents from the picture.hot lemonade(Speaking of guessing at the contents, many noodle bars have a vending machine outside where you would choose your type of soup, but you had better be able to read some Japanese as I never saw any with English nor even pictures I could decipher. You might be better going to one of the many places with plastic food displays instead.)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/hotel-review-capitol-hotel-tokyu-tokyo-japan/,"Hotel Review – Capitol Hotel Tokyu – Tokyo, Japan",Japan,"Japan is known for its service culture. Spend a week in the country and you will find yourself returning the bows of doormen, clerks, waiters and strangers. In that culture creating a hotel that stands out for its service seems like a daunting challenge, but that is just what the Capitol Hotel Tokyu is doing. I admit my experience at Japanese hotels is limited but, even though I was decidedly underdressed compared to the business men who frequent this 5 star hotel, the service was consistently respectful, attentive and pleasant.I should point out that I am not misspelling “Tokyo” in the name of the hotel. The hotel is not named after the city but after the railroad company “Tokyu” that owns this and over 50 other hotels and resorts in Japan. The Capitol Hotel is the flagship property of the company. The company has had a hotel at this location, near the residence of the Prime Minister of Japan and south of the Imperial Palace, since the 1963. The Beatles stayed in the Capitol Hotel when they visited Japan. But in 2006 the original hotel was torn down and this newer larger hotel was constructed. The new hotel opened in 2010.While the Beatles had to be content with a penthouse on the 10th floor, the current hotel offers a penthouse suite on the 29th floor that is fit for visiting rock stars and royalty alike. If you have to ask what the suite costs… you are not the demographic they are targeting. The penthouse has a bedroom, office, kitchen and large living and dining areas. With only the one bedroom you will probably want to book a few other rooms for your retinue, entourage or posse.For those of us with fewer gold records, or simply less gold, a regular room is impressive enough. In a country known for its small hotel rooms these rooms are spacious, comfortable and stylish. A typical room is divided into an entry way, bathroom and bedroom by sliding screens.The bath room has a smaller room for the toilet and a Rockingham Glass walled stone shower and bath area. The glass wall between the large shower and bath area and the bedroom can be screened off but probably indicate that this room would be better for a romantic stay (or a business trip) than a family outing. I do miss the spacious shower / tub area and a large shower head that made me feel like I was standing under a waterfall.The toilet has more controls than were needed to put men on the moon. After your business is completed the toilet can wash, massage, dry and “power deorderize” your nether regions. The best feature in the middle of the night is that the toilet seat is heated. This should not surprise me as I find many buildings in Japan in Winter are also kept a few degrees warmer that what I am used to.Since the Capitol Hotel Tokyu is a five star hotel I was not surprised that my room came with bathrobes. Since it is a Japanese hotel it also has slippers. I must say that the pajamas were a bit of a surprise. The bathroom also contained a supply kit with a toothbrush, hair brush and many other items you might have forgotten. If you don’t use any of the items they ask you to turn in the green “coin” in the kit to indicate you are saving the resources of Japan. Don’t do what I did and put the coin in your pocket only to discover it in the next city on your trip.The hotel includes 3 restaurants and a bar. I was most impressed with the sushi bar. I should preface this that I don’t tend to like fish so I don’t eat sushi at home. I joined the rest of the group for a sushi dinner more out of politeness than preference, but I was quite surprised how good the meal was. Our group included a few other non-sushi fans but also one woman whose husband is a sushi chef and all were impressed. The sushi I ate cost 5000 yen (almost $60) so the hotel restaurants are not for budget travelers but then neither is a 5 star hotel.I visited the hotel as part of a press trip sponsored by ANA (All Nippon Airways) to celebrate and publicize their new route from San Jose, California to Tokyo, Japan.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/flying-the-boeing-787-dreamliner-on-ana-from-san-jose-to-tokyo/,Flying the Boeing 787 Dreamliner on ANA from San Jose to Tokyo,Japan,"I just heard the news that ANA had an incident with a domestic 787 flight and has grounded all 787s until they get a chance to inspect all 17 of the aircraft in their fleet. This is singularly odd timing because I am on a press trip sponsored by ANA to celebrate and to promote their new route from San Jose, California to Tokyo, Japan. This is a route where they are flying the 787.ANA Press Trip Clearly ANA did the right thing of grounding their planes if they suspect there might be a problem, but my reaction when I heard the news was “I sure hope they get that all checked out so I can fly back on the 787 on Monday”. So while some may be shying away from the new 787 because of news stories I personally will be looking for chances to fly on one again, particularly one flown by ANA, and let me tell you why.I love to fly but compared to some of the more seasoned press members on my tour I am just an amateur plane geek. ANA flew us to Tokyo in their new business class on the 787 and I was amused to see how giddy some of these seasoned travel and aviation writers got over the plane, the ANA business class and the service.Boeing 787 DreamlinerThe Boeing 787 Dreamliner is a revolutionary design from Boeing. In common airline parlance a plane can sometimes be referred to as the “metal”. For example, ANA has a partnership with United airlines to cross sell each other’s products in a way that is “metal neutral”, that is to say not caring if the passenger is flying on a plane painted with a United logo or painted with an ANA logo. But the 787 is the first commercial jet that is not actually made out of metal. The structural elements of the 787 Dreamliner are carbon fiber composite.Having a plane that is not metal has a number of advantages. The plane is lighter and therefore uses 20% less fuel than a similar sized conventional jet. Metal corrodes and welds crack overtime so the expectation is that the 787 will need less maintenance over time. Roughly every 5 years ANA, for example, will rotate a jet out of service to perform and extensive inspection of all the welds and structural components that they do not anticipate needing for the Dreamliner.ANA Maintenance Facility – Haneta Airport What passengers will notice first may be the larger windows. I am not exactly sure why bigger windows seemed to make such a big difference to me psychologically but I was not the only one who had that reaction. It felt less like being trapped in a big metal tube. The windows dim using an electrical system rather than using the clunky windows shades of traditional jets. Even the bathroom has a window.The humidity on the 787 is also higher than that of a traditional jet because of a new recirculating air filtration system. This is enabled to some degree because there is not a concern with corrosion.  The idea is that after a long flight you won’t feel as dehydrated on the 787. Of our group of 8 writers and bloggers I may have been the only one who could not tell the difference. We toured the ANA maintenance facility and got to ask questions about some of the glitches that ANA has had with the 787 and so far, they told us, they feel they are pretty similar to those they have with any new aircraft design. When they started flying the 787 they had longer layovers and more time built into schedules for inspections. This was in part to deal with any issues that might come up in the plane and in part because they were training their maintenance crew on the new aircraft.At least before yesterday, ANA felt that the 787 had improved in aircraft availability over the year and a half they have been flying it to the 99% availability they see with the rest of their fleet of aircraft. I suspect it will soon return to service. I hope it will return to service by next Monday.Boeing 787 Dreamliner – Business Class on ANAANA Business ClassI usually fly coach so having any sort of lie flat seat would be a huge improvement but having space to stretch out all 6’ 3” of my frame was just awesome. Being able to recline without guilt because reclining did not take space away from anyone else was also wonderful.The business class configuration gives everyone their own space so this is not the sort of service for you if you want to spend the duration of the flight talking to a seat mate. However, for someone like me who wants to retreat into my own space it was ideal. The plane was noticeably quiet, such that I never pulled out my noise canceling headphones but simply used the headphones provided. The headphone jack is a two prong configuration so they probably would not have worked in any case.The video entertainment system gave plenty of options in a variety of languages. I watched four and half movies and slept for 2 hours on my trip from San Jose to Tokyo.The restrooms on the plane, at least in the business class had the Japanese style toilet with an array of controls that combine your usual routine with a good power wash if so desired. Frankly I don’t know why these have not caught on in the U.S.I almost always use carry-on luggage and was surprised how large the overhead bins were. My carry-on is large enough that I sometimes have to gate check it on some flights where the aircraft bin is too small to hold it. By contrast these bins were cavernous.Business Class service on ANAANA ServiceEven if I don’t get to fly on the Dreamliner on the way home to California I still should be able to enjoy the level of service that was provided by ANA. The menu for the flight had 24 pages with a mixture of Japanese and international cuisines. The presentation was attractive, the flavors were far above the oxymoron that is usually “airline food” and the white table cloth service was impeccable. I ate two meals on the flight over but that was limited only by my appetite, not by the availability of food service.There is a culture of polite service in Japan that I am only now starting to comprehend on this my first visit to the country. I have never been bowed to so many times nor returned so many bows in kind. This culture is infused in the ANA service and I swear it made me more well-mannered in response.ConclusionTwo thirds of the aircraft in the ANA international configuration of the 787 is dedicated to business class. Clearly ANA intends to cater to business travelers between Silicon Valley and Tokyo (and other connections in Asia). They intend to compete with the ease of San Jose airport, the better on-time record of San Jose airport, a wonderful new business lounge located just above the departure gate and a superior flight experience. I think they have a good chance of succeeding in this market and I offer 8 giddy travel and aviation writers as proof.Also read:Inflight: ANA’s Boeing 787 from San Jose to Tokyo [PHOTOS] by Chris McGinnis  Share this: "

What would you suggest?Tsukiji Fish MarketGary ArndtEverything Everywhere Visit the Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. If you have ever eaten seafood, there is a good chance you’ve eaten something that has been in Tsukiji.OnsenDavid ThompsonDave’s Travel Corner I love the Japanese Onsens – these are hot springs. Japan literally has thousands of these. They can be either indoor or outdoor and often contain special pools at different temperatures. Whenever I fly into Tokyo (NRT) I head for the countryside surrounding Narita and some of the outlying Onsens. Sexes are separated and clothing is often not worn. Like massage, the Onsens are a fabulous way to to deal with and soak away the tiredness of jet lag upon arrival!Otagi Nenbutsu-ji TempleErin McNeaney & Simon FairbairnNever Ending Voyage There are many amazing temples in Kyoto but the coolest one is a temple that most people don’t know about so it makes the perfect break from the crowds. Otagi Nenbutsu-ji features 1200 stone sculptures of the Buddha’s disciples scattered throughout a shady temple complex, all with different facial expressions and poses: scary, serene, cheerful, cute and just plain bizarre. You can spend hours exploring the quirky figures.FoodAndy HayesSharing Travel Experiences My favorite thing to do in Japan.. is eat! They have such a great representation of many different cuisines, from Indian to Thai to, of course, their own home-grown creations. My favorite are all the snacks, which range from shave ice to deep fried dough.Capsule HotelsJames ClarkNomadic Notes Stay in a capsule hotel. I recall seeing a documentary about them when I was young and it seemed to represent to me the futuristic and quirky side of Japan.

If visiting Kyoto be sure to enjoy an evening with the Geiko – the Kyoto-style and ‘higher quality’ geisha of Japan. Whilst there is chances to see the Geiko or Maiko (trainee Geiko) on the streets of Kyoto or at Gion corner, to have the chance to really appreciate the art you should book a Kyoto Cuisine and Maiko Evening which will give you a chance to see these beautiful performers up close and the opportunity to play traditional drinking games and talk to the girls (through a translator for the most part as they are encouraged to speak Kyoto-dialect.)SubwayLillie Marshall“Around the World “”L”” Travel Blog” The best things are Kyoto, of course, and eating, and the people.

https://amateurtraveler.com/3-things-i-learned-about-americans-by-not-living-with-them/,3 Things I Learned About Americans By Not Living With Them,Japan,"If you take a short, two-week trip out of your home country, you’ll most likely come back with many photos and stories about how differently people do things “over there.” You’ll notice the different body language, how the Japanese bow instead of shake hands, or, how Italians have wine with lunch on a work day. Indeed, I had the same experience myself the first few weeks I started living in Tokyo. Over time, however, I began to assimilate, and all the little cultural idiosyncrasies that were uniquely Japanese suddenly became my own.I lived in Japan for five years and returned to the states just a year ago. One thing that really surprised me was that after coming back, I became attuned to how differently people do things “over here” as opposed to Japan. I had been away for so long, that I hadn’t realized that cultural differences were all relative, and that we’re just as weird to the rest of the world as the rest of the world is to us. This knowledge was a wonderful gift, because it was only then that I began to realize just how unique we Americans are and learn to appreciate that uniqueness.When I came back from Japan I realized that Americans are:StraightforwardWhen gift-giving in Japan a common phrase that one should say is: Tsumaranai mono desu ga, dozo. This phrase, roughly translated, means: “This is a boring/insignificant item, but here you go.” The idea behind this phrase is that one should be self-effacing when one gives. Also, by saying that the gift isn’t very good (even if it is indeed very good) it releases the receiver from having to give a “thank you for your gift, gift” in return.One thing I’ve noticed about Americans is that we are often very straightforward, and prefer telling the truth than couching our language in niceties. When giving a very good gift, we’d feel no hesitation about saying that gift was indeed very good. One plus of this American-style candor is we have to worry about other people’s ulterior motives less because the language is less ambiguous. One drawback to this deal is that we get more braggarts than normal.CasualThe moment you meet someone in Japan the second or third question you’ll get is “How old are you?” Age is a big determining factor about how people address each other when they talk. If someone is older than me, for example, I will use more honorifics in my speech. If they’re younger, I wouldn’t use any.Although we used to address people as Mr. Ms. and Mrs. in the US, that custom has gradually faded away–to the point where these titles are used only to address our teachers in grade school. Although there are probably a myriad reasons for this, my guess is that Americans are a very casual people, and whatever formality they may have carried over from the old world is quickly being shed. Plus side: Americans are more friendly and open. Minus side: Americans are Crude.“Big”If there’s one thing that I heard Japanese folks say about the US, was how “big” everything was. The houses are big! The roads are big! The cars are big! The meals are big! And the people are…well, they’re big too. Japan is such a densely populated place, and because they’ve had to squeeze a bathroom and bedroom in a space that would be little more than half the average US studio apartment, I can see where this whole “Americans are big” thing comes from.America is such a huge country geographically that it’s no wonder everything started getting “big”. I’m not sure what the deeper implications of this are but I believe it has made Americans “think” big, and thus the disproportionate number of entrepreneurs out there taking risks. The downside to this bigness, however, is that Americans consume more resources per capita than any other country on the planet.I wouldn’t make these observations without seeing the same qualities of frankness, informality, and “big”ness in myself. It’s a part of my culture and is thus a part of me. I just needed to be outside of my own culture long enough to really see it.What about you, what are some things you’ve noticed about your own culture when traveling?Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/top-five-places-to-visit-in-nairobi-kenya/,"Top Five Places to Visit in Nairobi, Kenya",Kenya,"Nairobi is the biggest city of Kenya and the city is well known for how densely populated the city is. But there are many places of interest to visit while in Nairobi.Nairobi National ParkNairobi National Park is one of the most visited tourist destinations near Nairobi. The park is located seven kilometers away from the city of Nairobi. The park had been established back in 1945 and it is the oldest park in Kenya. Wildlife is abundantly found in Nairobi National Park which covers over 117 square kilometers. Wild animals commonly found in the park include zebras, lions, baboons, cheetahs, and lions. The park also has an animal orphanage that raises orphaned elephants and rhinos for later release back into the wild.Nairobi National MuseumThe Nairobi National Museum which reopened in 2007 holds an impressive collection of early man fossils in no small part because of its association with former museum director  Richard Leakey. This collection alone makes the museum worth your time, but the grounds are also home to Snake Park and Botanical Gardens. It is best to avoid Fridays at the museum when it can be overrun with school groups. The museum also hosts exhibits on Kenya’s history and culture.The Railway MuseumThe Railway Museum of Nairobi reflects the long history of railways in Kenya. All the different locomotives and steam engines placed in the museum belong to the colonial period of Kenya. Tourists who have a particular interest in the history or trains will find this a must stop.The Snake ParkThere are very few parks in the world dedicated to snakes only. The Snake Park is one such place to visit. You will find the deadliest and most poisonous snakes of all bound in grass cages. Some of the snakes are kept in deep and open pits. The Snake Park of Kenya is also home to some of the rarest crocodile species found in Africa. As mentioned before, the Snake Park is in the same compound as the  Nairobi National Museum.Uhuru ParkUhuru Park is amongst the ideally located tourist destinations within the center of the city. This park’s name has been derived from the word Uhuru which means freedom. The local residents of Nairobi use Uhuru Park for speeches and public rallies. Tourists can also find many monuments about the independence of Kenya. The park is not only a great place for public gatherings but people also find it a great place to relax under lush green trees with green grass.PodcastHear more about what to do in Nairobi and the rest of Kenya in Travel to Kenya – Amateur Traveler Episode 673.This article was written for Reliance Travel, a great source of cheap flights to Nairobi http://www.reliancetravels.co.uk/nairobi-flights.htmlShare this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/26-things-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-in-central-asia/,26 Things You Need to Know About Traveling in Central Asia,Kyrgyzstan,"Asia – the name of this particular continent likely brings to mind the images of the Far East – lush greenery, temples and perhaps sushi. While this is certainly one picture of Asia, the continent extends far from the Pacific Ocean and encompasses a vast array of landscapes, languages and cultures.Among the less traveled, but perhaps most intriguing areas of Asia are the countries located in the center of the continent. Central Asia includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan.These countries offer serious travelers amazing experiences unlike any they will find in any other region on Earth for many reasons:Central Asia has only been opened to travelers recently thanks to the dismantling of the Soviet Union. While all countries of Central Asia are now independent, many retain the Soviet-style government.The huge stretches of steppe and open plains of Central Asia are considered one of the world’s last great frontiers and more tourists travel to this region to experience the truly wide open spaces every year.Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked nation but has a sparse population. What it lacks in population, it more than makes up for in amazing natural appeal.Much of Central Asia is covered in steppe, cold and dry grassland, that stretches on for miles in any direction – allowing for amazing views into the distance.The most stunning natural site in the entire region is possibly Issyk Kul. This alpine lake is truly stunning and the peaceful nature of its surroundings is especially notable – especially on the least populated, South Shore.There are some areas inside Central Asia that have rarely had tourists or travelers from outside the region. Expect some curiosity and interesting accommodations as you explore deeper into this region.Due to the long history of domination by Russian Imperialism and then the Soviet Union, many of the nations in Central Asia are still struggling to build strong, independent governments. One of the most obvious symptoms of this struggle is the lack of infrastructure throughout the regions.There are a variety of languages spoken throughout Central Asia. While Russian would be useful as it is well-known throughout the countries, the native and more common languages include Turkic languages, Mongolic languages and Iranic languages as well. English is not a commonly spoken language in this region.The Ferghana Valley extends into Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and is strikingly beautiful with rivers, farmlands, and nearby mountains. This lovely, rich land is also prone to violence, however, and should be approached with caution.The mountains of Kyrgyzstan are lovely year-round and make an excellent destination for those looking to avoid the congested Ferghana Valley and experience peaceful, natural surroundings.Ancient ruins of Persian societies are easy to find in Tajikistan. Look for the remains of ancient cities nestled between far-reaching landscapes.The Silk Road, a major path for traveling over the last millennia left intriguing reminders in Uzbekistan. Look for old citadels in cities like Samarkand, Khiva, and Tashkent.The people of Uzbekistan are, perhaps, the most receptive of travelers with warm, generous personalities. While the people are friendly, the government of the country does make things a bit more complicated with paperwork.The largest, most populated city in Central Asia is Tashkent. The capital of Uzbekistan has a population of just over 3 million inhabitants and many modern trappings as well.The Aral Sea is fascinating, if depressing, to visit. This dead sea is the site of an ecological disaster and is littered with rusting boats and empty seashells.Those willing to travel into Afghanistan can see the Band-e Amir. These five lakes are stunningly blue and bright and connected by waterfalls. To reach the lakes, however, you must be willing to travel through the wilderness of the countryside.Central Asia offers skiing resorts and towns in several places. Among the most popular and accessible of these towns are Almaty and Chimbulak.• The food in Central Asia becomes more flavorful as you travel south. Expect meals to be very heavy on meat dishes and light on vegetables – it is challenging, although not impossible, to eat a vegetarian diet in this region.The drinks of choice in Central Asia include the vodka introduced to the region by the Soviets as well as the ancient choice of kumis, or fermented mare’s milk. (This is especially popular with tourists). Tea is common during mealtimes as well.Nightlife is not what you’d find in larger cities, but there are clubs and fun to be had in larger cities like Bishkek, Almaty, and Tashkent.While large-scale violence has happened in recent memory in virtually all of the Central Asian countries, most tourists are far more likely to have their things pick-pocketed than facing kidnapping, riots or bloodshed. Regardless, it is an area to approach with awareness of current events.Most Central Asian countries require a “letter of invitation” for tourists traveling to the region. These letters may be submitted on your behalf by a specialist travel agency or perhaps a hotel. Some tourists aren’t required to have a letter depending primarily on nationality.All Central Asia counties, excluding Kyrgyzstan, require a visa from travelers. Visas may be simple to get through arranged tours and specialized travel agencies or next to impossible – it all depends on the country and the mood of the government. Arrange as many visas as possible before leaving for a trip and plan time to deal with the embassies in each nation prior to leaving.The best airport to fly into the region is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Many flights also land in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but this airport can be a bit seedy and even dangerous after dark.Trains provide a popular way into the countries of Central Asia. Trains regularly arrive in Almaty, Bishkek, and Tashkent from Moscow and cities in China. Travel by boat and car is irregular and not highly recommended.Samarkand in Uzbekistan is one of the most famous of the Silk Road cities and is a testament to the Islamic style of building and architecture with domes and stunning tile work.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/intrepid-travel-cambodia/,Intrepid Travel Cambodia – Review: Cambodian Traveler,Cambodia,"Giant stone heads in jungle temples, like something out of tomb raider.

We rode around the city for a few hours as the day turned into evening. We sat in front and took pictures while our driver and cyclist sat behind us and pedaled us through the city traffic. We were passed by cars, motorbikes, and tuk-tuks.When we got off the bikes, Sarah, one of the younger of the Amateur Traveler listeners that had come with me on this trip declared that she was coming back on an Amateur Traveler trip. Not a bad start for day one.We were on a trip run by Intrepid Travel, on their “Cambodian Traveller” tour. We started in Saigon (or Ho Chi Minh City) with stops in Phnom Penh, Siem Reap (Angkor Wat), Battambang, finishing in Bangkok Thailand.Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City)A number of the people on my tour arranged to come in a day or two early to explore Saigon on their own or with some Urban Adventure day tours, but I arrived the same day as the tour started. I apparently didn’t learn anything from my experience the year before on the Amateur Traveler trip to Morocco.One thing we had been warned about but still left an impression was the traffic in Saigon. As Rob put it, it is not for the faint of heart. Honestly, it was not as intimidating as some of the videos I had seen. I had been told that you need to just keep walking at a constant pace and let all the motorcycles swerve to avoid you.The other thing you figure out quickly is that even though many of the meals on the tour are not included, these are not going to be expensive places to eat. We often ended up spending something like $3-4 for a good meal.In the morning we drove across the Vietnam country-side to the border with Cambodia.Cambodia BorderThe process of crossing the border was slow with a fair amount of waiting in lines, but it was interesting how much changed when we crossed the border. Cambodia is poorer than Vietnam and poorer still than Thailand we would learn later in the trip. The countryside had more trash piled up outside the houses. We came in the dry season so instead of verdant rice fields it was more dusty stubble. It seemed like every field was a rice field instead of a greater variety of crops. About every 1000 feet along the highway was a sign that said that this highway we brought to you by the Cambodian People’s Party.We also started to see more iron buffalos which are a 2 wheeled tractor with long wooden handles. People would use it to plow their fields or they would connect it to their cart to bring their goods to the city. We saw fewer cars.Phnom PenhDowntown Phnom Penh is a beautiful city laid out like a French colonial city with wide boulevards. We enjoyed our cyclo tour and we also enjoyed the restaurant scene in the city. Give me a good internet connection and I could picture living in Phnom Penh for a while.Cyclo TourOne of the interesting things about the cyclo tour is that unlike a tuk-tuk tour, you are alone with your guide and since your guide likely speaks no English, you are alone with your thoughts in the bustling city. I found it very peaceful and by all reports grinned like a fool the whole time.You sit in front so it is one of the best ways to get pictures of street scenes, locals or just the rest of your group. People would zip by us with a family of 4-5 on a motorbike. I even saw one person with a small washer on the back of their motorbike one time. Kids would smile shyly at us.Dinner Cruise on the Mekong RiverWe took a group dinner cruise along the Mekong with just the 10 of us on a boat that could have held many times that number.The river is busy not just with tourist boats but with ferries and locals with their small boats. A lot of the housing built along the river had an improvisational style.The Killing FieldsThe most sobering part of our trip was a visit to the Killing Fields. Near Phnom Penh is one of many different places in Cambodia where the Khmer Rouge would kill people who they considered enemies of the state. You could be labeled as an intellectual and therefore an enemy of the state just for wearing glasses. More than a million people were killed and buried in mass graves in these areas and despite the large numbers this was not an industrial process like Nazi concentration camps but people were killed with sticks and farm implements.If you are considering bringing school-age kids you should know that you will see things like the tree that the Khmer Rouge soldiers used to bash in the brains of infants. It was brutal. Many of the skulls from the victims were gathered together and are displayed in the Choeung Ek Memorial stupa.Tuol Sleng Genocide MuseumMany of the victims of the killing fields came directly from places like Tuol Sleng which was a high school that the Khmer Rouge turned into the notorious Security Prison 21 (S-21). Here prisoners were interrogated and tortured for around a month. When it was deemed that they could implicate no one else then they were transferred to the killing fields to be executed.It was one of around 150 such prisons across the country and from 1976 to 1979 probably 20,000 people passed through its gates as prisoners. 4 adults of these survived because they had some useful skill like being able to fix a typewriter. Much of the artwork inside is done by a couple of these survivors and depicts torture and other disturbing scenes. The day we were there one of the survivors was there signing his book. 4 children also survived.I did get to the point where I needed to stop looking at some of the photos and come outside. This is a lot to process.The greatest loss of life in the time of the Khmer Rouge happened not by execution but because the Khmer Rouge emptied out the cities and forced people into the countryside into some more “pure” form of communism. This led to mass starvation.The thing I did not understand was that with one of four people dying in the country at the time of the Kmer Rouge, everyone was affected. So we continued to hear echos of those days in everyone we met. The father of our guide Chanta was taken off by the Khmer Rouge when Chanta was a young child. and he never saw his father again.Royal PalaceSome of us visited the Royal Palace during some of our free time in the city. We hired an English guide at the front gate which was very affordable and had an impromptu private tour.Other ToursAmong the things we did not try was firing a rocket launcher… but apparently that was a possibility according to the menu of tours we saw at a local coffee shop.Spider MarketHow much the Cambodian people just like to eat icky things like spiders or how much they had to eat icky things like spiders to keep from starving in the time of the Khmer Rouge I was never clear. But they do like to take tourists to markets like the spider market to see if they can get you to eat a fried tarantula or two.I did try the tarantula but have no need to do so again. I have eaten crickets before and bamboo worms. I would rather have pizza.Silk MakingWe made a stop to see the local production of silk. They showed us how they raise the silkworms and then boil the cocoon to extra the silk. They also showed us the making of thread and weaving process.Floating VillageThe highlight of the road to Siem Reap for me was a visit by boat to the floating village on Tonlé Sap Lake. Tonlé Sap is the largest lake in Cambodia but gets 5 times larger and much deeper in the rainy season. For that reason where we started the houses were built high above the lake on stilts. Here in the dry season, we drove in on a dirt road and much of the landscape was covered with dust from the red clay soil.﻿﻿We hopped in a couple of the narrow colorful boats with outboard motors and a long prop sticking out the back. We had to stop periodically on the long ride out to the lake when the prop would become tangled in some bit of trash or old clothes and our boatman would pull out a hacksaw to free the prop before we could continue our journey.The “village” itself was a series of brightly pained buildings on pontoons floating in the middle of the lake. This is definitely one experience that getting there is half the fun. Siem ReapThe main city for visiting Angkor Wat and the other temples in the area is Siem Reap. Siem Reap is a very comfortable tourist city these days. A couple of decades ago there were 5 hotels in town but now there are more than 100. Siem Reap is big business, but that makes sense because this area is one of the largest temple complexes on the planet. Within a 20×20 kilometer region, there are over 300 temples dating from the 800s to the 1400s.With lots of great restaurants and street vendors selling $1 fresh fruit smoothies, Siem Reap is an easy city to love.Angkor WatAngkor Wat was built as a Hindu temple complex but changed to Buddhist at the end of the 12th century. Angkor Wat is huge. The name means “City of Temples”. There is an exterior square moat that is 3 miles (5 km) by 3 miles (5 km). The outer wall is 3.6 miles long. We came in the back way and I was surprised how uncrowded it was. This is the best known of the temple complexes although not my favorite.Angkor Wat was sacked in 1177 A.D. by the Cham people of what is now Vietnam. It was never completely abandoned by it was largely neglected after the 1600s.You can climb up the interior part of the temple to get views of the area.We visited twice. The first time in the morning but the second time at sunrise. There is a lot of waiting around at sunrise with hundreds of your closest friends all trying to get the same picture of the temple reflected in the pool in the front of the complex. A few of the people in our group got bored with the waiting and found that the complex was open so they had it mostly to themselves in the pre-dawn light.Angkor ThomThe Angkor Thom (“Great City”) temple complex is 3km x 3km. The most famous of its temples is the Bayon temple which is the one with the giant faces.It was built after Angkor Wat and shows some of the scenes of the victory over the Cham people as the Khmer kingdom was restored. Ta ProhmTa Prohm is also informally called the Tomb Raider temple as it was featured in the movie of the same name. All of the temples in the area had this overgrown look at one time, but Ta Prohm is the only one where they retained some of the trees growing over and through the temple complex. This temple or the Bayon temple was my favorite, but I am not sure which one.Village VisitI overslept and missed a trip that much of the group went on with Chanta our guide who sponsors a charity where they are digging wells in rural villages. They visited one of these villages and it was a highlight of the trip for some of the group.Banteay SreiThe 4th and final temple complex we visited was Banteay Srei which is known for its red sandstone and elaborate carvings that are better preserved than most of the temples.BattambangAfter we left Siem Reap we made a stop at a roadside restaurant where one could try the roasted rat or snake. One could… I didn’t. Chanta said it very well. he said, “In Cambodia, everything is on the menu.”Honestly, the people who tried the rat said it wasn’t bad, but I could not get over the idea. As Roger ate rat the look on his wife’s face I told her was, “I could have gone to Europe”. I was close.Battambang was where I was having problems getting money out of an ATM. While Siem Reap and even Phnom Penh are well connected to the world, Battambang is a little less so and I had to try 4 different banks before I found one where I could use my ATM card.Bamboo TrainOne of the highlights of Battambang was the bamboo train. It is a kind of Rube Goldberg mechanism where locals took train wheels, a bamboo platform, and an outboard motor and created a train ride on these old warped train tracks. The train goes nowhere and the cars head in both directions so occasionally you have to get off, disassembled your car to get it off the tracks so a train can pass. When you get to the far side they reassemble it heading back the way you came. It is a silly contraption… and fun.Bat CaveWe went out to one of the hills near the town by tuk-tuk to a cave that disgorges thousands of bats at sunset.We also watched a collection of small monkeys that think they own the neighborhood.Thailand BorderThings changed again the next day as we drove into Thailand. Suddenly there was a great variety of crops instead of just rice fields. The road quickly gained a lane and the iron buffalo were replaced with trucks carrying goods to market.We stopped for a treat of sticky rice cooked in bamboo which is a treat on both sides of the border in the area. But on the Cambodian side, it comes with the story that they would cook these under their fire to hide from the Khmer Rouge that they were eating more food than their meager rations.Bangkok ThailandThe tour officially ended the morning after our group arrived in Bangkok but nearly the whole group stayed in Bangkok for a day or so to explore that wonderfully chaotic and delicious city. Much of the group went together to the Damnoen Saduak Floating Market our first day in Bangkok which is one of the Urban Adventures tours in Bangkok.ConclusionsCambodia is hot. Plan accordingly. Bring lightweight clothes that you can rinse out in the sink at night to save time getting your laundry done. I did have my laundry done cheaply in Siem Reap. Also, heat kills batteries so you might need one more camera battery that you would think. There are a lot of things to take pictures of in Cambodia, see my photos.Cambodia is delicious… assuming you skip the spiders. Food, including street food, was good and cheap. This was also true in Saigon and Bangkok.Cambodia is a fascinating country and frankly, it can use your tourism dollars. The “Cambodian Traveller” tour by Intrepid Travel  is a great introduction to the countryShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/visiting-killing-fields-cambodia/,Visiting The Killing Fields of Cambodia,Cambodia,"As part of the recent Amateur Traveler trip to Cambodia we visited the Choeung Ek Killing Fields Memorial and the Genocide Museum to learn more about the horrific time of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. In 1975 The (Chinese backed) communist Khmer Rouge soldiers marched into the capital of Phnom Penh and gained control of the country. Even civilians who may have welcomed the demise of a corrupt government were quickly given reason to regret the Khmer Rouge victory. The very day of their triumph soldiers told everyone in the cities of Cambodia that they needed to leave their homes and move to the countryside. Their excuse was that they were looking for CIA or KGB spies or that the Americans were going to bomb the city. Within 3 days Phnom Penh was a ghost town.This was the beginning of a 4-year nightmare of Khmer rule. They wanted to turn the country back into a purer agrarian economy where there was no difference between the rich and the poor. The assumed anyone who was an intellectual was an enemy. Even just wearing eyeglasses could get you killed.The Killing FieldsThe Choeung Ek Killing Fields Memorial outside of Phnom Penh is only one of 300 different execution and mass grave sites in the country, but this one has been turned into a memorial to the victims and a museum to explain what happened. Victims here were usually delivered by truck from the nearby S21 prison in long strings of manacled prisoners. They were made to dig their own shallow grave and then often were killed by having their heads bashed in with farm tools. At this site as many as 300 people a day would be killed in this fashion.One mass grave was filled with the bodies of children, babies and women (mostly naked) as the Khmer Rouge killed entire families so that no one would be left to avenge the murder.Another grave was filled with the skeletons of Khmer Rouge soldiers who had defected to the Vietnamese in Cambodia’s war with Vietnam. Cambodia claimed all of South Vietnam as part of traditional Cambodia. These soldiers were said to have a “Vietnamese head on a Cambodian body” so they were beheaded.Many of the mass graves in the area have been excavated and the bones have been interned in a large glass-walled stupa that displays piles of skulls and other bones. Each skull has a color-coded dot that indicates the method of execution.A small two-room museum and a short video expand on the history of the site and of the Khmer Rouge. We learn that its top leaders were intellectuals and even teachers. It is long on what and when, but how can you explain how someone who was a teacher could make being a teacher a crime punishable by death? How can you explain how soldiers could kill babies by bashing them against a tree?S21 / Tuol Sleng Genocide MuseumWe also visited the nearby Genocide museum which is housed in the old S21 prison. This converted high school became a place where prisoners were tortured for information before being killed. The museum is filled with photographs of the victims staring out at you through haunted eyes. There are also paintings of various ways that prisoners were tortured that were painted by 2 of the 7 adult survivors. One of the survivors was present that day, signing his book. He is alive today just because he was able to fix a broken typewriter so he was kept around like the other 6 survivors to perform administrative tasks. A large mural also shows Vietnamese soldiers with the 4 children who they found alive when Vietnamese soldiers liberated the prison.There was a point during the visit that it just all became too much. It is hard to understand the kind of hate that you need to so dehumanize other people that you can treat them like the prisoners were treated.Other StoriesMy misunderstanding with the story of the Khmer Rouge was to think that after we had seen the memorials and the museums that we were done with the story, but when a country loses a fourth of its population to executions, starvation and civil war, everyone lost someone. Everyone has a story. Our tour guide lost his father to the Khmer Rouge. The guide we had in the royal palace told us of the 22 members of the royal family that were buried alive and of his own uncle who was killed for being a teacher.I also misunderstood that when they talk about the time of the Khmer Rouge they talk of the 4 years that they were in power, but the suffering of the county continued for decades after the Vietnamese invaded in the time of the civil war. Cambodia is a country still haunted by its past. You can’t make being a teacher or an intellectual a crime and then expect to recover in a single generation.This was part of a larger tour done with listeners of the Amateur Traveler by Intrepid Travel, on their “Cambodian Traveller” tour.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/a-culinary-trip-to-southeast-asia/,Southeast Asian Food Culture,Cambodia,"I have always been a big fan of food. I admit it. But not just any type of food, I like exotic cuisine. Common burgers and pizza were never my thing. As far back as I can remember, I have always been into things that are out of the norm in terms of food and enjoyed experimenting. Maybe that is the reason why I love to do food travels. That is, traveling to different countries in order to have a taste of their unique cuisine. I even keep something like a diary in which I put the records of all my food-related impressions.The best destination in terms of exotic cuisine so far, in my opinion, has been Southeast Asia. Countries like Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand offered me amazing treats that managed to please my palate like no other meals before. Following is a brief description of my food travel to these distant and marvelous countries whose meals had the biggest culinary impact on me.CambodiaThe Cambodian cuisine, also known as Khmer cuisine, is one of the world’s oldest. Cambodians are known for their passion for rice. As a matter of fact, they are the nation that consumes the most rice.A distinctive ingredient in many Khmer dishes is prahok, which many Westerners might find a bit pungent, probably due to its nature, which is actually a type of fermented fish paste. As unusual as it may sound, it is an almost integral part of the Cambodian meals. It took me a while to get used to its taste but put in the proper meal, it is quite good.As for the meals themselves, my favorite one proved to be Amok trey, which is the most well-known amongst visitors. A freshwater fish fillet is prepared with a variety of aromatic spices (pounded lemongrass, shallots, garlic, etc.), egg, coconut milk and roasted peanuts. All of this is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. The dish is not spicy at all but is very fragrant and zesty.IndonesiaIndonesian cuisine is rather diverse, mainly because of the fact that Indonesia is composed of about six thousand islands. However, just like Cambodia (and all other Asian countries), rice is an inseparable part of their meals. I noticed that Indonesians serve it both as a savory and a sweet food. Other staple foods they prefer include sweet potato, yam, and breadfruit.What impressed me a lot was the wide application of peanuts in many signature dishes – whole, ground or in the form of peanut sauce. My favorite Indonesian meal turned out to be the satay. Although it is also known in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, it originated in Indonesia. It consists of seasoned and grilled skewered meat served with sauce. The meat can be pork, chicken, goat, mutton, fish, etc. A variation made of tofu is also served. The sauce is usually soy-based.ThailandThai cooking is known to blend elements of several Southeast traditions. What I put in my ‘cuisine diary’ was that I noticed that most Thai dishes emphasize food prepared with strong aromatic components. Also, I learned (the hard way) of the famous spiciness of the local cuisine. The dishes in Thailand are famous for their balance of three or four fundamental food taste senses: bitter, sour, sweet and salty. Probably, I need not even mention the importance of rice in Thai cuisine. Its usage is as wide as in every other Asian country.As for my favorite Thai food… this is a bit tough to decide. I really enjoyed Kaeng hang-le, Bami haeng pet, but the one that appealed to me the most is Kai yang. It is basically a halved and pounded flat marinated grilled chicken. I believe that what gives Kai yang its special flavor is the special marinade, which includes garlic, fish sauce, coriander root, turmeric, and white pepper and the fact that it is prepared for a long time over a charcoal flame.I wish I could have included more meals in my report, but to be honest, I failed to remember the names of some of them (being in the locals’ language). After all, I tried so many dishes that in order to memorize all of them and their ingredients I would have needed to write a whole book. Bottom line, whichever country of Southeast Asia you might decide to visit, you are bound to be amazed by their cuisine. A true paradise for every foodie like myself.You can read more from Grace at http://www.vacationhomes.net/.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/artist-in-cambodia/,An Artist in Cambodia – Cambodia through the Eyes of a Painter,Cambodia,"Carved Relief’s of Dancing Apsaras, Preah Khan, Angkor, CambodiaI am a professional artist and have been lucky enough to take several long painting-focused trips. Starting In early January 2010 I embarked on a four-month painting and travel tour of the Indochina region including Cambodia as well as Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar.As I traveled to Cambodia, I passed through the southern border crossing that is near Trat, Thailand and Koh Kong, Cambodia. It is a bit nerve-racking to cross the border, mainly because of bad reports about the constant hassle by hustlers that work the border crossing. Here it was fairly minor. A good rule is not to give your passport to anyone except the officials behind the glass. It cost about $15 to bribe the border guard to give me a visa. This is basically the set fee. Some people refuse to pay and they make you hang around for about an hour before they were let in. I did not know this at the time. The other hassle was a medical quarantine table where someone took your temperature (for a fee) to see if you have avian flu.SihanoukvilleDespite my trepidation, I arrived safely in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, which is a popular beach resort. At least half the people in this town are “falang” (foreign) tourists. It is pleasant and very cheap. Rooms are $5 to $10 and meals $3. Sunshine and beach are free. The water is like bathwater, warmer than the air at night. There was much less humidity here as well. I rented a scooter to tool around in for $4 a day.Fishing Boat, Otres Beach, CambodiaSihanoukville was very nice and I was able to paint quite a bit. The scenery isn’t that great here but it is paint-able. Lots of little kids gather around when I paint and until I packed everything away, they rifled through all my stuff. They stole my lunch one day, and while I could not get it back I insisted that the thieves at least share it with the whole gang. They probably needed it more than this well-fed American.At first, I was near Serendipity beach, which is a busy tourist center. After a few days, I found myself at Otres beach, where I discovered this French-run kind of south sea mini-resort (“Shanti-Shanti” with three huts, $10 night) run by a very nice couple, Matt and Sophie. They made me feel at home and suggested some nice places to paint. Matt and Sophie have a simple restaurant where the main dish was a daily Quiche. This was a nice western food break from the local fair.Fishing Boat, Otres Beach, CambodiaDuring my stay at Otres Beach, each morning I would wake before sunrise in my little grass and wood bungalow, crawl out from under the mosquito netting, walk the 20 ft. to the ocean and wade out in the loveliest blue water, at just the right temperature. After my swim, I wandered up to the small restaurant where I enjoyed a big cup of espresso, a brioche, and jam. I felt like I was in some exclusive Caribbean resort. Of course, the shower was a barrel and a pot, and sand got in everything, but it didn’t bother me a bit. After my morning routine, I went out and painted most days.KampotAfter I left Sihanoukville, I went to Kampot, a small almost sleepy town with much crumbling French architecture. Its relative quiet made it a nice place to paint. Gastronomically a highlight was these wonderful fruit shakes that are made on little tables set up on the side of a road with a kitchen blender. The Sisters cafe deserves a special mention for wonderful coffee and apple pie. The Blissful Guesthouse had a great bar and atmosphere. This town really had a pleasant ex-pat vibe. While there, I also visited some old Hindu temples in caves, and later I had the most extraordinary prawns with raw pepper at Kep beach.Colonial French Prison – Kampot, CambodiaPhnom PenhAfter Kampot, it was up to Phnom Penh, which is an OK but busy city, although much quieter than Bangkok. The main goal was to get some art supplies and clothes. Clothes I found, but no art supply store in Phnom Penh that I could locate. Highlights there were the wonderful people I met at my guesthouse “The Top Banana” and a sobering visit to the Toul Sleng Genocide Museum.  The rows of photographs of the inmates/victims taken by the jailers were heartbreaking. One thing that was really interesting to see was a group of stone carvers working outside near the Fine Arts Academy carving statuary for a Wat across the street. Whether these were students or workers I could not ascertain.Stone carvers In Phnom PenhAngkorAfter a few days in Phnom Penh, I took a bus ride up to Siem Reap town, which is about 12 KM from Angkor Wat. Angkor is one of the largest sets of ruins in Asia. Angkor Wat is the name for one of the central sites. I visited 5 different sites (there are dozens) and did a half dozen paintings and drawings. You are not able to rent scooters here so I ended up with a bicycle, which is relaxing although it was extremely hot.  Most visitors hire guides with either scooters or a car.Sunset, Angkor, CambodiaMy favorite site was Preah Khan and also some sandstone monuments just east of Angkor Thom. The relief work (carvings) was a special highlight of all these monuments. In Siem Reap town (the ‘base camp” for Angkor visitors) I visited Artisans D’ Angkor, an organization that teaches and supports the traditional arts of the region. Their showroom and workshops were tremendously interesting.Overall, Cambodia surprised me.  Sometimes I was nervous in Cambodia because of all the bad reports you hear, but the truth is it was absolutely wonderful, and my interactions with Khmers were always pleasant, or even enthusiastic. A big plus here, in a twisted sort of way, is the poverty, because there is a lot less traffic here than in Thailand. One day while I was out painting on a dusty red road near a town, someone came by to give me a can of soda, “in thanks for painting our village”. It made my day.The paintings I created are all small single session sketches around 6 x 9 in. in size. The drawings are a little larger. To see most of the work I did on this trip take a look at Painting On Location In Southeast Asia. If you’re interested in the logistics of my painting gear you can take a look at My Asian Painting Equipment.See also Intrepid Travel Cambodia – Review: Cambodian TravelerPodcastLearn more about Cambodia by listening to one of our Amateur Traveler podcast episodes about Cambodia. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/26-things-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-in-central-asia/,26 Things You Need to Know About Traveling in Central Asia,Kazakhstan,"Asia – the name of this particular continent likely brings to mind the images of the Far East – lush greenery, temples and perhaps sushi. While this is certainly one picture of Asia, the continent extends far from the Pacific Ocean and encompasses a vast array of landscapes, languages and cultures.Among the less traveled, but perhaps most intriguing areas of Asia are the countries located in the center of the continent. Central Asia includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan.These countries offer serious travelers amazing experiences unlike any they will find in any other region on Earth for many reasons:Central Asia has only been opened to travelers recently thanks to the dismantling of the Soviet Union. While all countries of Central Asia are now independent, many retain the Soviet-style government.The huge stretches of steppe and open plains of Central Asia are considered one of the world’s last great frontiers and more tourists travel to this region to experience the truly wide open spaces every year.Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked nation but has a sparse population. What it lacks in population, it more than makes up for in amazing natural appeal.Much of Central Asia is covered in steppe, cold and dry grassland, that stretches on for miles in any direction – allowing for amazing views into the distance.The most stunning natural site in the entire region is possibly Issyk Kul. This alpine lake is truly stunning and the peaceful nature of its surroundings is especially notable – especially on the least populated, South Shore.There are some areas inside Central Asia that have rarely had tourists or travelers from outside the region. Expect some curiosity and interesting accommodations as you explore deeper into this region.Due to the long history of domination by Russian Imperialism and then the Soviet Union, many of the nations in Central Asia are still struggling to build strong, independent governments. One of the most obvious symptoms of this struggle is the lack of infrastructure throughout the regions.There are a variety of languages spoken throughout Central Asia. While Russian would be useful as it is well-known throughout the countries, the native and more common languages include Turkic languages, Mongolic languages and Iranic languages as well. English is not a commonly spoken language in this region.The Ferghana Valley extends into Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and is strikingly beautiful with rivers, farmlands, and nearby mountains. This lovely, rich land is also prone to violence, however, and should be approached with caution.The mountains of Kyrgyzstan are lovely year-round and make an excellent destination for those looking to avoid the congested Ferghana Valley and experience peaceful, natural surroundings.Ancient ruins of Persian societies are easy to find in Tajikistan. Look for the remains of ancient cities nestled between far-reaching landscapes.The Silk Road, a major path for traveling over the last millennia left intriguing reminders in Uzbekistan. Look for old citadels in cities like Samarkand, Khiva, and Tashkent.The people of Uzbekistan are, perhaps, the most receptive of travelers with warm, generous personalities. While the people are friendly, the government of the country does make things a bit more complicated with paperwork.The largest, most populated city in Central Asia is Tashkent. The capital of Uzbekistan has a population of just over 3 million inhabitants and many modern trappings as well.The Aral Sea is fascinating, if depressing, to visit. This dead sea is the site of an ecological disaster and is littered with rusting boats and empty seashells.Those willing to travel into Afghanistan can see the Band-e Amir. These five lakes are stunningly blue and bright and connected by waterfalls. To reach the lakes, however, you must be willing to travel through the wilderness of the countryside.Central Asia offers skiing resorts and towns in several places. Among the most popular and accessible of these towns are Almaty and Chimbulak.• The food in Central Asia becomes more flavorful as you travel south. Expect meals to be very heavy on meat dishes and light on vegetables – it is challenging, although not impossible, to eat a vegetarian diet in this region.The drinks of choice in Central Asia include the vodka introduced to the region by the Soviets as well as the ancient choice of kumis, or fermented mare’s milk. (This is especially popular with tourists). Tea is common during mealtimes as well.Nightlife is not what you’d find in larger cities, but there are clubs and fun to be had in larger cities like Bishkek, Almaty, and Tashkent.While large-scale violence has happened in recent memory in virtually all of the Central Asian countries, most tourists are far more likely to have their things pick-pocketed than facing kidnapping, riots or bloodshed. Regardless, it is an area to approach with awareness of current events.Most Central Asian countries require a “letter of invitation” for tourists traveling to the region. These letters may be submitted on your behalf by a specialist travel agency or perhaps a hotel. Some tourists aren’t required to have a letter depending primarily on nationality.All Central Asia counties, excluding Kyrgyzstan, require a visa from travelers. Visas may be simple to get through arranged tours and specialized travel agencies or next to impossible – it all depends on the country and the mood of the government. Arrange as many visas as possible before leaving for a trip and plan time to deal with the embassies in each nation prior to leaving.The best airport to fly into the region is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Many flights also land in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but this airport can be a bit seedy and even dangerous after dark.Trains provide a popular way into the countries of Central Asia. Trains regularly arrive in Almaty, Bishkek, and Tashkent from Moscow and cities in China. Travel by boat and car is irregular and not highly recommended.Samarkand in Uzbekistan is one of the most famous of the Silk Road cities and is a testament to the Islamic style of building and architecture with domes and stunning tile work.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/artist-in-laos/,An Artist in Loas – Laos through the Eyes of a Painter,Laos,"I am a professional artist and have been lucky enough to take several long painting-focused trips. Starting In early January 2010 I embarked on a four-month painting and travel tour of the Indochina region including Cambodia as well as Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar.Boats On The Mekong, Luang Prabang, LaosLuang Prabang, LaosAfter the heat of Cambodia, I decided that I lacked enthusiasm for a long bus ride up through the jungles of southern Laos so I opted instead for a flight from Siem Reap to Luang Prabang, Laos. Luang Prabang is one of the nicest cities in SE Asia, a combination of Buddhist temples and French colonial architecture set on the Mekong River. As one can imagine it is also very touristy, but still not that busy. It also was deliciously cool in northern Laos – not cold mind you, but pleasant. This was the season (March) for slash and burn agriculture so it was also very smoky (The constant advice on my trip from other travelers/ex-pats was that November and December are actually the best time to visit the Indochina region).Boats On The Mekong, Luang Prabang, LaosI ended up spending about 10 days here and did a lot of painting. It was a nice gastronomic change because in Laos they have great coffee and bread, thanks to the French history. Highlights are the boats along the Mekong, Wat Xieng Thong, and just the general ambiance.The full name of the country is the Lao PDR. Supposedly this means “People’s Democratic Republic”, but the ex-pats will tell you it actually stands for ” please don’t rush.” In comparison to the constant sales pitches one often receives in Thailand and Cambodia it was truly relaxing.Monks watching me paint – Luang Prabang, LaosI met a lot of terrific travelers here and interacted with many young monks. Luang Prabang is filled with Buddhist Wats and monks. The monks are often teenagers who are only temporarily fulfilling family obligations, sometimes for a few years, but often for just a few weeks. As teenage boys, they are often not very monk-like, but smoking or ogling girls, or even poking fun at me as I painted! Mostly they were very nice and often well educated, speaking English. English as a second language was much more common in Laos and Cambodia than in Thailand. This is probably because of the poverty. Many more NGO’s are in Laos helping out and giving English lessons.Restoring Wooden Buddha’s in Luang PrabangWhile there I stopped by the National Museum, which was the old palace for the Laotian royalty. It had some very nice mural and mosaic work. Especially interesting was some art conservators I met from Japan who were working with locals on the restoration of old wooden Buddhas. A survey was made in Luang Prabang province about 10 years ago of these Buddha statues. A sad note is that since then about 100 of the 1100 in the survey have disappeared. Plans were afoot to implant the remainder of them with microchips.Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Prabang, LaosNong KhiawThe Town of Luang Prabang is near the intersection of the Mekong and Nam Ou rivers. At the suggestion of several other travelers, I took a 7-hour boat ride up the Nam Ou River to the town of Nong Khiaw. This was in a motor-driven longboat with about 10 seats that sat very high in the water. The water is low at this time of year so once we actually had to jump out and push. But the boat ride was extremely scenic with towering cliffs and fishermen at work for the whole trip. A surprise bonus was watching locals pan for gold, which is something they do in the dry season when the rivers are low. Nong Khiaw is a well-located but very small town amidst beautiful surroundings.Panning for gold on the Nam Ou River, LaosMuang NgoyAfter a few days, I took another short boat ride up the Nam Ou to an even more beautiful and remote town, Muang Ngoy. Here I had a really great view of the river from my bungalow balcony. The is not much to do there but I did a few paintings and there was a nice beach. A highlight here was a short boat ride I took up to a weaving village with a Laotian tour guide I met. I bought a few textiles and then a woman who also accompanied us bought a live chicken for our dinner. The trip was a free tour but I had agreed to buy all the beer, and well, those Laos can drink.Nam Ou River at Nong-Khiaw, LaosOn the way back we ran into a few Lao guys on boats, having a party in the middle of this stunning river with giant cliffs all around. They had a big bamboo log made into a bottle filled with Lao Lao, which is the whiskey the locals make from rice. We tried a little and then we’re on our way back to the town where we had the chicken cooked by our friends’ sister. The night ended with a game of spin the chicken head, which is a drinking game. You spin the chicken head and whoever has the beak pointing at them has to do a shot. When the booze is gone the ”winner ” has to eat the chicken head (luckily I lost).Nam Ou River at Nong-Khiaw, LaosLaos was definitely the nicest part of this trip. You really felt that the locals were happy to see you. This was not a feeling I got often in other parts of my journey.A final note on Laos: While In Muang Ngoy I observed a team of de-miners working in the countryside to locate and neutralize old explosive mines and unexploded cluster bombs from the Vietnam War. Thousands of innocents have been killed or maimed over the years. This is a real tragedy and I encourage everyone to get involved in solving this issue. What I would like to do with the work I created on this trip is to use them as a fundraiser for a charity that is working with these issues.PodcastLearn more about Cambodia by listening to one of our Amateur Traveler podcast episodes about Laos. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,Lithuania,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-must-see-sights-on-your-baltic-tour/,6 Must-See Sights on your Baltic Tour,Lithuania,"While the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania may not seem like the premier travel destination for the discriminating traveler, nothing could be further from the truth. These former Soviet bloc countries are rich in history and both natural and architectural beauty, and veteran travelers the world over are discovering this region’s unique cultural flavor. With manor houses and castles dating back to the mid-fourteenth century or even earlier, this area combines the stark beauty of Eastern Europe with some of the most breathtaking and impressive art and architecture to be found anywhere on the planet. These six sites are among the most famous and spectacular in the region, making them “must-see” stops on your Baltic tour!Turaida Castle, Sigulda, LatviaThis Brick Gothic masterpiece of medieval architecture was constructed under the aegis of Albert, Archbishop of Riga. Built atop the ruins of Caupo of Turaida’s castle, which was built of wood and later razed to the ground, this striking edifice was recently restored to its former glory. Featuring a commanding view of the forests and hills around Sigulda, Turaida Castle stands as an amazing monument to Eastern European ingenuity and architectural know-how.Cesis Castle, Cesis, LatviaCesis Castle stands as a perfect example of what modern Westerners often think of when they hear the word “castle.” The original castle, known as Wenden Castle, began construction in 1237 CE as the residence of the German Master of Order. Over the next three centuries, fortifications to encircle the strategically important town of Cesis continued at a steady pace. The castle was attacked during the Livonian War (1558-1583). One of the most notorious actions of this war occurred when defenders in the west wing of the castle set off explosives, destroying the wing and themselves rather than submit to the rule of Ivan the Terrible. While much of the castle is in ruins, the reconstruction of the castle has been ongoing for around two centuries.Tallinn City Wall, Tallinn, EstoniaThis amazing fortification, originally consisting of forty-six named towers and nearly two and a half kilometers of walls, is not only an impressive example of medieval defensive thought and strategy but encloses Tallinn, one of the most beautiful and unspoiled cities in Europe. Constructed by the order of Margaret Sambiria, the wall was initially named for her. The original structure was less than five meters tall and a meter and a half wide at the base, but has since been added to.Tallinn City HallAmid the medieval splendor of Tallinn rises the new City Hall building, created in 2009 by the Bjarke Ingels Group, a Danish architectural firm. The soaring and airy modern design is intended to evoke the finest principles of democracy, including transparency and thus accountability of government to its people. As a monument to participatory government, the Tallinn City Hall is impressive, but as a feat of modern engineering in the Baltic, it is truly in a class by itself.Lithuanian Art Museum, Vilnius, LithuaniaBuilt in 1933 to house and showcase the best of Lithuanian art from the medieval period to the modern day, the Lithuanian Art Museum incorporates classic Greek design sensibilities but merges them with a modern European flair. The result is a building that is just as amazing for its exterior as the works of art that adorn its interior. Among the oldest pieces in the museum is a portrait of Stanislovas Sabina, a renowned official of Vilnius, created by N.A. Flensburgite in 1590. The museum was commissioned to preserve the Lithuanian national character and flavor for future generations and includes some of the most celebrated and controversial Lithuanian artists in its halls.Vilnius Cathedral of Sts. Peter and PaulThis breathtaking cathedral dates as far back as Lithuanian Christianization and is the oldest church in the nation. Construction began under the rule of King Mindaugas, who was baptized along with his family in 1251. Although the cathedral has been destroyed and rebuilt several times during its history, with the current structure dating from the mid-1400s, historical documents indicate that the Cathedral of Vilnius has largely stayed true to the original scope, scale, and grandeur to which it was originally constructed. The catacombs beneath the cathedral are a treasure trove of Christian and Lithuanian history, and these catacombs are open to the public for tours. In addition to its status as a historical site, the Cathedral is also an important archaeological site whose many layers provide a fascinating glimpse into the techniques and methods of thirteenth-century masons, sculptors, and other artisans. The Cathedral of Vilnius continues to hold services and Latin Mass weekly, a testament to this magnificent building’s enduring importance to the Lithuanian people.This article was supplied by www.baltictravelcompany.comShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/latvia-beaches/,Best Beaches in Europe – 9 Reasons to Consider Latvia’s Beaches,Latvia,"If you are looking for the best beaches in Europe, the Greek islands, Spain and France are probably the first places that come to your mind. But Nordic Europe has something spectacular and far less crowded to offer. Some of the best beaches in Europe, for nature lovers, are actually the beaches in Latvia.As in the case of many destinations these days, travel to Latvia is mostly associated with its gorgeous capital city Riga. Yet, look behind the scenes and you will discover something surprising. The Telegraph had a recent article with 25 amazing things you probably didn’t know about Latvia. One of those things was the sandy beaches in Latvia.Read on and find out 9 reasons why beaches in Latvia are hidden gems that you will want to visit right now.#1 Pristine Nature & DiversityThe Latvian coastline is more than 500 km (300 miles) long. Most of it is vast and secluded white sand beaches that are nothing less than spectacular. For thousands of years the open Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga has formed a unique coastline here, and this process is still ongoing. You will rarely see the same coastline when visiting Latvia again and again. The wind, autumn storms and in some places also people keep changing its scenery. Yet, it still remains pristine and not overdeveloped.You will find white-sand beaches stretching along the open Baltic Sea on the wild western coast.Secluded sandy beaches are also predominant along the Gulf of Riga. In some sections you will see dramatic scenery with stony beaches covered with bigger or smaller stones and pebbles.Some beaches in Latvia have unique protected wetlands and raised bogs stretching into the coast. You will find flat areas, hilly dunes and steep sea coasts in Latvia.#2 Beaches In Latvia Are Truly SecludedThere are public beaches that get busy in the hot summer days. These are the ones in Jurmala – the resort city near Riga and the beaches in Riga (yes there are great beaches even in our capital city). Also, the beaches in other bigger cities like Liepaja and Venstpils and in the coastal villages near Riga are busier than an average beach in Latvia.But, most of the beaches in Latvia are tranquil and secluded. The coastline is only occasionally interrupted with small towns and fishermen villages. You will find peace and a connection with nature here.#3 Easily ReachableLatvia is not a big country. It is a third bigger than Switzerland, the Netherlands and Denmark, a little smaller than Ireland and twice as big as Belgium.You can reach any point in Latvia from Riga within one day. And from most beaches in Latvia you can still get back the same day. I highly recommend not to rush and take your time while you are in Latvia.Take a bus, rent a car or find a guide and in an hour, two or maximum three (e.g. to Liepaja city) you will get to places where you will have a hard time believing that you are still in the Nordic Europe and it is the Baltic Sea out there.#4 It’s Green Out ThereLatvia topped the Global Environmental Index in 2012. Hence you may guess it is a green country. More than 50% of Latvia is covered by forests. The coastal area is green too. The whole Latvian coastline is protected. Building of houses etc. is allowed only in villages, towns and cities. That is both to protect vulnerable habitats from people and people from the sea.You will have to cross lush pine forests to get to the beach in Latvia most of the time. In many places the pines reach impressive sizes and are close to 200 years old. You will not see tall concrete buildings or private beaches on Latvian coastline. All beaches in Latvia are publicly accessible.Even in the big cities like Riga, Liepaja and Jurmala there is always a “protected belt” of forest that separates the beach from the houses. Sometimes it is hard to say that you are still in the city, as the forested areas are vast.Many protected areas of international, European Union or local importance are in the coastal zone. Visit thefamous Kemeri National Park very close to Riga or go to the amazing and wild Slitere National Park in the North-West.During the Soviet times, the western coast of Latvia was a military zone. Development was restricted there. This allowed nature to flourish for fifty years, resulting in amazing pristine coastal areas that you can still enjoy today.If you are a bird-watcher, go to Kemeri National Park close to Riga or to the remote Nature Park “Pepe” in the far South-West of Latvia. Latvia is on the spring and autumn migration route of many bird species. You can spot many rare bird species on the beaches in Latvia.#5 Cozy Fishermen VillagesWhile going to the beaches in Latvia, you should and will certainly stop in many fishermen villages on your way. The coastal zone holds deep fishing traditions.The most popular fishermen villages close to Riga are Lapmezciems, Ragaciems, and Klapkalnciems on the western coast of the Gulf of Riga. Sauklrasti, Tuja, and Salacgriva towns and many smaller villages on the eastern coast of the Gulf are popular places for locals. All these can get a bit busy on hot summer weekends, but they are mostly quiet if you go there in working days or off-season.Should you decide to go to more distant beaches in Latvia the places like Pavilosta and Jurkalne are the must visit ones. They are on the western coast of Latvia. Pavilosta is a cozy enjoyable fishermen village. Jurkalne has the steepest coast in Latvia and the views here are amazing.In Slitere National Park, you will find Kolka village with the famous Kolka Cape there. This is a unique place, where the “two seas” meet. From this point you will see the open Baltic Sea (or “The Big Sea” as locals call it) on the West and the Gulf of Riga (or “The Small Sea”) on the East.In almost any fishermen village, you can buy traditional smoked fish. In some places you can even learn how this food is being made. The most popular smoke fish is flatfish called “bute” here. It is really yummy and goes very well with beer, which is also great in Latvia.#6 Activities OutdoorsBeaches in Latvia are great for different outdoor activities.HikingHiking along the Baltic Sea coast is an amazing thing to do while you are in Latvia. Hiking can be arranged as day hikes of any distance and duration from Riga or from any other coastal city, town or village.Very passionate hikers can choose to challenge the unique long-distance hiking trail along the Baltic Sea: The Baltic Sea Path (or “Jūrtaka” in Latvian). On this trail you will see the best beaches in Latvia and hence also some of the best beaches in Europe.Catching The SunIf you think beaches in Latvia cannot compete with the best beaches in Europe for getting a sun tan, think twice.The weather in Nordic Europe is, of course, overall unpredictable. Yet, in a summer like this year’s, the sun started shining in May and it is still 26 degrees Celsius (79 degrees F) outside while I am writing this post at the end of September. It is colder now In Greece. I checked.This was the longest summer in recorded history of Latvia. The climate is obviously changing, and beaches in Latvia are getting more attractive for lovers of warm weather.Even if your planned beach day gets a bit spoiled by some clouds and rain, you can always do something else like hiking. Hiking is, of course, much nicer when the day is not as hot.WatersportsThe beaches in Latvia also offer things to do for water sport lovers.The fishermen village Pavilosta on the very west of Latvia is the place where all the local windsurfers and kite surfers go.On calm days you can also try standup paddle boarding in the Baltic Sea in many places.If you are a passionate kayaker, sea kayaking is also an option here. Yet be careful, check the weather forecast and/or find a guide. The Baltic Sea is cunning and does not forgive mistakes.Sailing is also very popular in Latvia and there are many small ports for sailboats to stop.SwimmingFinally, you CAN also swim in the Baltic Sea and in the Gulf of Riga. Yet, be ready for water temperatures that may vary greatly. On a hot summer day it may reach 23-25 degrees C (73–77 degrees F), yet this is rare. More often you will get 17–20 degrees C (63 – 68 degrees F) or even less if the wind is from the shore. On hot summer days, it is, however, even nicer to have a refreshing swim. Be careful though. Don’t go swimming alone if it is stormy. Also don’t swim too far from the shore, especially in the open Baltic Sea. There are occasional rip currents.#7 Some Of The Best Beaches In EuropeBeaches in Latvia are the most diverse among all three Baltic States. Some can be definitely called the best beaches in Europe. Yet, being in Nordic Europe, they have been greatly overlooked so far. In a way it makes me both sad and glad at the same time. Sad, because so many travelers don’t even know they exist. Glad, because they have remained secluded hidden gems.#8 Latvia is Still AffordableLatvia is still very affordable compared to most other travel destinations in Western, Southern and Northern Europe. You will pay about 40% less compared to Scandinavia. Consider this when planning your trip to Europe or looking for the best beaches in Europe.#9 Great In All SeasonsLatvia is often considered a travel destination only for summer months, I would like to break this prejudice here. Beaches in Latvia are gorgeous in every season.The frozen Gulf of Riga is stunning in the winter.It is not rare to meet seals on the ice. Don’t disturb them. If you meet a seal’s baby, in particular, leave it alone. People often think seal pups are abandoned and bring them to the zoo, making orphans out of pups that were not orphans before they interfered.You can also choose going cross-country skiing on the beach. The flat terrain is great for this activity in the winter.Add a Latvian Sauna Ritual to warm you up after hiking or skiing on the beach, and you have a perfect winter holiday. Share this: "

One of the things that made this trip so memorable was the variety of the places we saw on our trip. We saw modern cities, mountain villages, the many faces of the Sahara, cities with mud walls that looked like Timbuktu and walled cities on the coast. This was our first trip to Morocco.Over the course of the trip, we stayed ina traditional Berber homestaywestern style hotelsat a Sahara desert camp in a tenta couple of riads (traditional Moroccan palace)MarrakeshWe were met at the airport by a van and driver from Intrepid. We are used to traveling independently but can certainly get used to having someone just come and meet us with a sign after a long trip from the west coast of the United States to northern Africa. If you book a group on a trip that all travels together then the airport pick-up is included. When you all come from different places, as we did, it is an extra charge but worth it.Most of our group was smarter than we were and added extra time in Marrakesh at either the beginning of the end of the trip. But we did not have enough vacation time so we arrived the day the tour started.We met up with our tour group at 6 pm that night and met our guide, Khalid, for the first time. At this point much of the group were strangers. We did have my wife Joan’s brother join us, some friends from college and some former guests on the Amateur Traveler podcast, so we knew more of the group than anyone.One person in the group missed the requirement that you need to have travel insurance… oddly enough, since this was my trip, it was me so I had to quickly go online and buy a policy.We would grow to love our guide, Khalid. He was a deep source of information about Morocco. He loves Morocco but could patiently explain how things work even when he thought they might work better some other way. He is fluent in at least 4 languages and we would not be surprised when he won a world-wide competition as “guide of the year” the year after our trip.We got acquainted a bit and then Khalid led us to a bus to the Medina. It was a bit overwhelming for the first night, with so many people crowded around. He got us seats outdoors at a large table and began ordering food. It was beyond chaotic, as food kept coming, and waiters and cooks yelled at each other and Khalid yelled at them when he didn’t get what he wanted. There was a huge assortment of food, including couscous with potatoes, carrot, eggplant, bread, sweet or hot sauce, skewers with veggies, chicken or beef, and turkey sausage. At the table next to our people were peeling vast quantities of hard-boiled eggs and making sandwiches or something.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Morocco/Southern-Morocco/i-Dvn9r2f/0/defc3d37/1280/IMG_3982-1280.mp4Rachel, who traveled to Morocco by herself told us that the day she spent in Marrakesh as a solo female traveler was much less comfortable than once she joined the group. This was particularly true when she visited the medina by herself.High Atlas MountainsWe ate breakfast at the hotel and loaded up in the van and headed into the High Atlas Mountains. Even when you know they are there, it is surprising to see snow-capped peaks within an hour of Marrakesh. The country had received quite a lot of rain before our trip so this part of the trip was through lush green landscapesWe stopped at a weekly outdoor market along the way, which was a big dusty area, with a variety of items for sale, including spices, live animals, vegetables, mule shoes, and pottery. A few “helpful” guides attached themselves to some of us, trying to sell us their wares as they walked along pointing things out to us.  A few of us bought a few pieces of jewelry for a few dollars.We also passed a “room” open to the market with a sheet across the entrance, which Khalid said was the dentist. We’re pretty sure the conditions wouldn’t have been very sanitary, and aren’t sure what they would use for anesthesia.We drove on from there to the town of Imlil where we would leave the van and take just our day packs on up to the mountain village where we would spend the night. There was an option to ride mules if the hike was too strenuous, which a few in the group did. For the rest of us, other mules carried our day packs. It was a decent hike, not too steep for most of it, and took a little over an hour.We arrived in the village of Aroumd, to the guest house, or gite, where we would stay. We had tea in the courtyard, and lunch of cut vegetables, omelet, rice, lentils, chicken skewers, and oranges.A local guide took part of the group on another hike in the mountains to a shrine. For the less adventurous, Khalid took us around the village, showing us the bakery, where everyone in town brings their bread to be baked each day, the hammam (baths), and the school nearby. We saw women gathering due to a village woman’s death. There were children running around and playing, and we heard the call to prayer from the mosque.Dinner was in a large sitting room with benches all around the perimeter of the room, a common arrangement in the country. Each couple had their own bedroom but the bathrooms were shared. It was quite comfortable, and the air was so fresh outside.Breakfast was in the same room as dinner, with yogurt, bread, crepes, coffee, and juice. After breakfast, we packed up to head back down the mountain to Imlil to reconnect with our bags. The hike back down wasn’t bad either, though the mules were not available for riding for that stretch.Ait BenhaddouWe began our drive to Ait Benhaddou, a UNESCO World Heritage Site on the edge of the Sahara. It was about a 6-hour drive. We stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant, sitting upon a terrace, with chicken or beef skewers and fries.Ait Benhaddou was built along the salt caravan route between the Sahara and Marrakech. It was built starting in the 17th century. The site is a fortified village, or ksar, with kasbahs, or fortified houses, within.We were able to climb the steps to the granary, which would have served as storage but also for protection if attacked.We were able to go into one of the houses and visit with the woman who lived there, who of course served us tea. We could ask questions through Khalid. The funniest story was that the film Gladiator was filmed there in part, and Russell Crowe had stopped to visit with her. She had no idea who he was, but she has a signed movie poster on her wall that he gave her. Parts of Game of Thrones were also filmed in the picturesque town.We also got to see someone making art by putting tints onto paper, which all looked yellow at first until he held it over heat, at which point the actual colors appeared. He made paintings this way of desert scenes with camels and the building style of the kasbah.  So cool!We stayed that night in a hotel near the site, Rose du Sable, and had the chance for a cooking class. Several of us made our own tajine, a traditional dish that we ate often on the trip, made with meat, vegetables, and spices, always served with bread.  It was fun to put together the meal with the spices they had pre-selected to use. Our rooms were just off the terrace around the pool.OuarzazateAfter breakfast at the hotel, we drove to Ouarzazate, the film capital of Morocco. There was a very small cinema museum, which a few of us toured, seeing sets from movies that we had never heard of (mostly biblical stories).We stopped at Project Horizon International, the non-profit that Intrepid supports in Morocco, to tour and see the work they do providing physical therapy and prosthetics for people with physical disabilities, along with training in art or a craft, so that they can have their own businesses. We were able to buy some of the craftwork in the gift shop, such as jewelry, painted glassware, or ceramics.ZagoraWe drove on to Zagora, where we saw the famous sign “Tombouctou 52 Jours” (52 days by camel, it’s apparently only 6 days by jeep).We stopped to pick up lunch food at a market and went to the rug merchant. None of us were interested in buying rugs but it was interesting to learn more about them.  We were able to use an upstairs room at the store to eat our lunches, in the company of the cats who lived there.Ksar Kasbah TaourirtWe took the van to the Ksar Kasbah Taourirt. It was a very well preserved town, restored with 3 sections: administrative (judge), living space, harem, sauna, first lady room, and cellar. It’s like a labyrinth, you don’t go out the way you came in.We stayed at a 4-star Hotel Ksar Tinsouline. Joan and I tried out the pool, but it was very cold. We sat out on the patio visited. We enjoyed dinner on the patio, tajine, steak, fries, crème caramel. You can pretty much assume that every meal will include a tajine of some sort.We had breakfast also on the lovely patio, and left around 10:30 am, with a day pack for the camp.TamegrouteWe drove to Tamegroute, where we all bought headscarves to be prepared for possible sandstorms in the Sahara, and visited a library with ancient books of religious studies and math and science texts, where an elderly man gave explanations of what we were seeing.We stopped at a pottery factory, which operated just as it would have hundreds of years ago, including a man using the spinning wheel sitting in a hole in the ground, and kilns cut into the rock wall. We toured through the mud buildings and were able to buy really beautiful pieces made either there or at another ceramic factory within the same cooperative.Then, finally, the camel ride. We got to a hotel of sorts with many low buildings and ate our picnic lunch that we’d prepared for at a small grocery store on the way. Then we saddled up, tied on our headscarves, and headed off on our camels… into a thunderstorm. None of us had expected that, and all we could do was laugh as ultimately after only about 10 or 15 minutes Khalid had the drivers turn the camels around and head back. It is not likely you will have this experience as this is the first time Khalid had run into this situation after years of guiding.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Morocco/Southern-Morocco/i-Tz4fJGq/0/b2c0ee6a/640/IMG_4054-640.mp4We tried waiting out the rain, but it was determined to continue. All the while we tried to find a spot that the rain didn’t come right through the dirt and grass roof and drip muddy water on us.  The camel drivers were pressed into service to provide tea, which may not have been a good idea, as the tea probably wasn’t boiled well enough and caused a few stomach ailments for the rest of the trip. If we had had a SteriPen with us, we probably could have avoided that problem.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Morocco/Southern-Morocco/i-WDQcMXr/0/9747d59c/1280/MVI_0962-1280.mp4Khalid was also calling ahead to the tour company to determine whether the rain would wash out any of the ravines we had to cross on our drive in the 4x4s. Eventually, he determined that it was safe, and we headed out.  One of the drivers really enjoyed the off-road freedom and raced a bit.Sahara CampMost of the Sahara in Morocco is barren but not sand. We were driving to one area of large sand dunes.We all safely arrived at the Sahara Camp, which had several large tents each with 2 or 3 beds, plus a kitchen and dining tent, and a lavatory building with a few stalls and a sink (no toilets – very rustic!).People climbed up to the dunes for the view, but Joan was feeling pretty queasy so rested, and wasn’t able to eat dinner, finally tossing her lunch during the night. Turns out Jim and Rachel had also gotten sick. After the rain, the sleeping tents also smelled of wet camel… which was not the best smell.In the morning those who could ate breakfast and eventually we headed out and back to civilization. The drive back was a bit calmer as Khalid had told the drivers to take it easy, especially as we had some cranky stomachs. Joan slept most of the way, surprising the other people in our 4X4 since the drive was anything but smooth.We stopped along the way to visit with a nomad family who actually has lived in the same location for many years, but they live out in the desert in a few tents made of blankets and tarps. They do have a cooking tent, but of course no electricity. They have a motorbike for trips to town.They were parents of grown children, who had all moved to the city, but 2 small grandchildren and a flock of goats lived with them. A few of us could fit into the tent and visited some, and when Khalid said where we were from, the mother did not know of America. Khalid explained that it is across the ocean, and she had heard of the ocean. It was amazing to see examples such as this where, in some ways, time has almost stood still, just a few hours drive from modern cities.TaroudantWe drove on to Taroudant, with a few stops along the way. We were all very interested in seeing the “flying goats” who climb trees to eat the argan nuts. We were very lucky to have the chance to see a flock of goats who were, in fact, climbing in and jumping out of trees very close to the side of the road.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Morocco/Southern-Morocco/i-fBJXwr3/0/be20f365/1280/IMG_4084-1280.mp4We also stopped to see how saffron is raised. We stopped and visited with a gentleman who grows saffron, and he showed us what the plant looks like and how he extracts the spice from the plant. He served saffron tea, and people had the chance to buy some as well.We also stopped at an argan oil cooperative, where we could see the very manual process of grinding the nuts down into a paste much like peanut butter after which the oil is separated out and used in cosmetics and hair products.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Morocco/Southern-Morocco/i-B5LrcCq/0/a88aa222/1280/IMG_4107-1280.mp4We stayed in Taroudant, at Hotel Dar Zitoune, a riad in a garden setting, with many paths between the main building and other buildings with rooms. Staying in an old palace was quite the improvement over tents smelling of a wet camel.We enjoyed a trip to see Taroudant’s original medieval walls as well as the local market.EssaouiraOur last few days would be in Essaouira, on the coast. This walled city has a large old town medina where we all enjoyed quite a bit of shopping for handmade items such as woodwork, crafts, leather products, pottery.I enjoyed wandering the side streets and adding to my collection of pictures of old doors.  Khalid took us on a walking tour with a local guide, which was very good.  It was good that we had 2 nights here and didn’t have to be in a van at all after some really long travel days. We went out to dinner at a restaurant that mostly offered seafood. I was able to get a slice of pizza and a break from ordering a tajine.I went out exploring by the fishing port, and a local fisherman gave me an impromptu tour. I went back and paid him for his time later in the day.We did walk along the water to another area with beaches and a few cafes. It was really a nice town, with a mix of modern and the old in the Medina. We had fun shopping and bargaining (sometimes trying a bit too hard to get the price down, and talking the guy out of the bargain).  We grabbed dinner with a small group.MarrakechBack to Marrakech. We were back at our original hotel, and all went together to a nice restaurant for dinner. A few of the group members were staying on to see more of Marrakech. We were off to the airport around 7 am for our flight home.ConclusionMorocco, specifically southern Morocco is amazing, beautiful and diverse. The Intrepid Travel South Morocco Discovery proved to be a great way to see a lot in a little period of time. Book extra time in Marrakech at the beginning or end of your tour. Bring a large card for your digital camera. I took hundreds and hundreds of photos.See all my photos from Southern MoroccoListen to the podcast episode from the trip. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/see-fes-marrakech-meknes-rabat-four-imperial-cities-morocco/,"What to See in Fes, Marrakech, Meknes and Rabat – the Four Imperial Cities of Morocco",Morocco,"The Four Imperial Cities of MoroccoThe four imperial cities of Morocco, Fes, Marrakech, Meknes, and Rabat, have all been capital cities at some point in history. Rabat is the current capital but, whatever the status of these four exotic locations, they offer visitors a unique insight into the lives, past and present, of their inhabitants in very different ways.FesA UNESCO world heritage site, Fes is Morocco’s second-largest city and one that has retained its lifestyle since medieval times. The most exciting of the four imperial cities, Fes is made up of three towns, one of which is the walled city of Fes el Bali, where half of the people still live. A complex system of alleyways and lanes will give any visitor a peek into the past, as shopkeepers and traders go about their daily business. And here you won’t find any cars. Horses and donkeys are the main forms of transport, ferrying goods back and forward within the walls.The best way to explore the maze-like Medina is to get, literally, lost. There are tour guides available in case the thought of wandering around this place is too much to handle alone. It’s full of people, wonderful aromas of spices, and street food at every corner to tempt those taste buds. It’s a colorful part of Fes which displays the pure essence of Moroccan culture and should be on any visitor’s itinerary.The Merenid Tombs, located up on a hill outside of Fes are worth a look, not so much for the giant tombs themselves, but for the views over the city. There isn’t much left of the tombs, but several of the original inscriptions can still be read, so they are interesting to see from that point of view. However, hiking up the hill will offer some spectacular views of the city and the mountains, especially when the sun is setting and the lights of the city come on. It’s from this vantage point that the actual size of the medina can be appreciated.MarrakechLocated near the Atlas Mountains in southern Morocco, Marrakech is the third-largest city in Morocco. It is comprised of two parts, the Medina and the modern area called the Gueliz, and, as with the other four imperial cities of Morocco, it’s the historical sights and sounds that visitors come to see every year.Djemaa El Fna is Marrakech’s main square, busy any time of the day, it is during the evenings it really comes alive. Locals and tourists alike, dancers, storytellers, musicians, all merged together with the sound of drums and excited voices coming from every angle. It’s a plethora of activity which will fire up the senses. The street food is plentiful too, with incredible seafood, vegetables, and meat skewers to keep hunger at bay.A fun way to experience life in Marrakech is to brave the souks (markets). For first time visitors it can be slightly bewildering, but going with the flow, brushing up on haggling skills, and investing in a good map is a surefire way to enjoy it. It’s easy to get lost in the narrow lanes that twist this way and that, so it might be a good idea to hire a local guide. There are different souks that sell different things like spices, kaftans, and pashminas, teapots, tea, lanterns, and candlesticks but, remember, haggle for everything. Just like Djemma El Fna, the sights, smells, and sounds will attack every sense, but it’s an adventure that won’t be forgotten in a hurry.MeknesAnother one of the four imperial cities of Morocco is Meknes, located in the northeast of the country. It’s a vibrant, modern city, but one that is relatively bypassed by tourists in search of more popular cities in the region. However, good food, interesting attractions and a more relaxed vibe mean that Meknes is still a city worth visiting.The city has 27 gates that lead into the walled city and the grandest of them all surely must be Bab Mansour Gate. It stands at one end of the medina and was built, not as a bastion to protect the Sultan Moulay Ismail but to pay homage to him. Indeed, the opulent structure, with its tiles of green, gold and white marble columns is said, not only to be the most splendid in North Africa but also one of the most beautiful gates in the world.In the heart of the medina is El Hedim Square, where most of Meknes congregates in the evenings. It was a place of public announcements and punishments, but these days it is a lively place with cafes, restaurants, snake charmers, musicians and horse rides. The square has an energetic vibe and it’s a fabulous spot to sit with a cool drink and watch the world go by.RabatAlthough home to around 1.6 million people, Rabat is the least well known of the four imperial cities of Morocco. It’s located right next to the Atlantic Ocean and the Bouregreg River, and has, in the past, been second place in CNN’s Top Travel Destination awards. And rightly so, Rabat is small, so it’s easily navigable, especially on foot, there is a wealth of history to be learned and it is a lot less touristy than other larger cities, something that is rather appealing to some.One of the few holy places that is open to the public in Morocco is the Mausoleum of Mohammed V, and it’s one of the two most visited places in Rabat. The mausoleum is a beautiful specimen of Moroccan architecture, its sentries, dressed in bright red and on horseback, guard the remains of the king and his sons. The building is white with a green tiled roof and has ornate arches, white marble columns, and granite floors. The interior is exquisite, the doors and ceilings are decorated with carved motifs and patterns. In the middle, a granite block stands, and visitors come to pay their respects silently to the king who is interred there.The second most visited place in Rabat is the Hassan Tower. Construction began in the 12th century and was set to be the largest minaret in the world, but when Sultan Yacub al-Mansour died, the construction work stopped. The minaret is made of red sandstone and is surrounded by the incomplete walls and columns of the unfinished mosque. It’s a nice place to spend a bit of time, wandering around the columns and enjoying the views of the sea and the city.Whether it’s the maze-like Medina of Fes, the souks of Marrakech, the most beautiful gate in the world in Meknes, or the last resting place of Mohammed V in Rabat, one thing visitors can reply on is that the four imperial cities of Morocco have something for everyone and they will leave wanting more.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/make-the-most-of-morocco-five-destinations-for-every-taste/,5 Best Places to Visit in Morocco,Morocco,"Image by iphilippFrom the glamour and danger of Casablanca, to tripping out with hippies in Hideous Kinky, most of us will have ingested Morocco in one form or another without even knowing it, through the numerous books and films that are set against its cinematic and diverse landscape.Situated at the top of Northern Africa, this destination has been uniquely influenced, not only by its Arab and Berber cultures and African roots, but also by the European countries that are just a short distance away on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea.Its location makes it a fantastic option for shorter holidays, as flights from London can get you there in less than four hours, and a ferry ride from southern Spain takes just half an hour to cover the nine mile journey across the Gibraltar Strait.From surfing to shopping, there are destinations to suit every budget and lifestyle. Here are just a few cities that should be at the top of your Moroccan wish list.TangierPerched on the northerly tip of the country, Tangier has borne the brunt of clashes between Western influences and African cultures, and it is arguably all the better for it. A unique blend of Spanish, French, Portuguese and African roots, this city is a gateway to the rest of Morocco.Despite accruing a reputation for hustling and conmen, there are now dedicated tourist police to help ensure your stay here is fun, safe and hassle-free. Discover the city on foot by strolling along the beach or take a taxi out to the west to explore Hercules Cave, one of the city’s most beautiful and archeologically significant natural tourist spots.Visit: The Museum of Moroccan Arts, located in the former royal apartments used by the Sultans of Morocco, in the historic area of Place de la Kasbah. Admission is free, and the museum contains a great selection of Muslim art, antiques, pottery and silks.FesExplorers and architecture fans should fly straight to Fes’ Saïss Airport to make the most of this city’s exquisitely preserved buildings. Fes is often described as the ‘Athens of Africa’, and its medina, or Old City, is a World Heritage Site which is believed to be the largest urban care-free area in the world.Lose yourself in the narrow walled streets and beautifully detailed mosaic temples or head to the Merenid Tombs for a bit of breathing space and panoramic views across the whole city.Eat: For a deluxe dining experience, head to Riad Fes, situated in the heart of the Medina. Mixing traditional Moroccan food with European influences, this is pricey fare for Fes but well worth it for the location alone. The hotel has a modern bar and restaurant, with multiple areas to enjoy dinner, from the terrace to the pool – just don’t forget to bring your swimming costume!MarrakeshPerhaps the most well-known destination for tourists, Marrakesh in southern Morocco is a labyrinth of souks, snake charmers and riads. The best advice I can give for anyone visiting Marrakesh is to relax and don’t have a strict itinerary – let the city and its colorful characters find you.Notoriously difficult to navigate thanks to a distinct lack of street numbers and countless winding paths within the medina, you’re best sitting this one out if you have control freak tendencies. On the other hand, if you could quite happily spend five hours shopping, this city is for you! Of course to ensure you don’t get too lost you could try a walking tour around the city’s ramparts to see its beauty from afar.Shop: Prepare to bargain at one of Morocco’s most recognisable locations, the souks of Marrakesh. Each souk is divided into specialties, with alleys dedicated to spices and textiles and one of the best for picking up kaftans and embroidered slippers is the kissaria, located between Souk El Kebir and Souk des Babouches. Open between 9am and 7pm, the souks are free to enter but keep an eye on your belongings as the alleyways of the kissaria are very narrow.CasablancaCasablanca may get a bad rap on travel forums, but who wouldn’t want to explore the city made famous by Rick’s Cafe and the antics of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman?Morocco’s largest city is considered the economic centre of the country and therefore lacks the charm of Tangier or Marrakesh, but it’s a great destination for a short break thanks to a cosmopolitan culture and extensive urban development. Having said that, the outskirts of the city are awash with shanty towns which provide a stark reminder of how uneven wealth distribution is in this city.Eat: At Rick’s Cafe located on Boulevard Sour Jdid next to the public gardens, the restaurant inspired by this city’s famous Hollywood film. Rick’s Cafe pays homage to the film with its decor and was set up by a former American diplomat. Expect plenty of fresh fish and veggies with a French and Moroccan twist, and plenty of tourists! Visit on a Sunday to make the most of their Jazz evening while you dine.AgadirCalling all surfers! Head to Agadir if you want to spend your Moroccan vacation riding the waves. Situated on the south-west coast of Morocco, this shipping port lies at the foot of the Atlas Mountains and is a far cry from how you might imagine Morocco to look.The entire city was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 1961, and as a result it has a distinctly modern feel, with European influences, wide roads and large buildings. It’s proximity to the Atlantic Ocean makes it a popular spot with surfers and regardless of your ability to balance on a board, there will be a holiday package to suit you, from surf tours and intense one-on-one lessons, to yoga sessions on the beach après surf.Do: Visit Ranch Amodou Cheval after you’ve finished surfing to take the trip of a lifetime – on the back of a camel! Located in the small village of Tamraght, the ranch offers the opportunity for adventurers to trek along the beach at sunset, or go on half day, full day or two day tours of the local area. If camels aren’t for you they have horses too.These are just five incredible Moroccan destinations – are there any more that you’d recommend?This article is provided by Hotelopia, the one stop shop for booking your next holiday.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/island-running-routes/,7 Exotic Island Running Routes,Madagascar,"The #runitfast hashtag has now hit 1.2 million posts on Instagram, so fitness expert Erny Peibst has mapped out running routes for all levels on some roads less travelled. Get away from it all and have a well deserved break, immersing yourself in the beautiful scenery and culture these islands have to offer.From mountain peaks to sandy beaches our planet has some incredible landscapes to explore, so pack your bags and get ready to test your endurance on these exotic islands.1. Running Route on Kauai, HawaiiKnown as the ‘Garden Island’ for its lush vegetation and steady rainfall, running on Kauai gives you an unbelievable opportunity to take in some stunning views of nature.Not only is there remarkable scenery, but along the coast, Kauai is home to white-sand beaches that stretch out into the clear turquoise water of the North Pacific Ocean.Tourists usually stick to the north of the Island, staying in places like Princeville so we’ve mapped out a route that will get you away from the busy tourist traps and allows you to take in all the treasures Kauai has to offer.The route will take you on a scenic 4-mile run along ‘The Coconut Coast’ from Wailua to Kealia. The flat, red clay path stretches along coastal cliffs giving you stunning views of the Pacific on one side and of the island’s vegetation on the other. As you take a leisurely run along the track, you may even catch a glimpse of dolphins or whales in the waters below.2. Running Route on Réunion, near MadagascarThis tiny island off the coast of Madagascar is no bigger than Dorset but rises more than 10,000 ft above the ocean and is the perfect place for any dedicated runner to test their abilities.Home to a truly untouched wilderness, the island was formed from 2 volcanoes (one of which is still active) that have created a heart-stopping natural beauty in the middle of the Indian ocean.The route mapped out starts at the small island village, Piton Sainte-Rose. The coastal town has incredible views and is the perfect place to catch the sunrise if you want to start your run early.The run totals 6.8 miles testing you on a range of terrain and revealing some breathtaking views along the way, not only of the Indian Ocean but then turning inland to the dense island vegetation.About three-quarters of the way around you will also come across an unexpected treasure in the form of Anse Waterfalls. A stunning natural waterfall that climbs 15m high with a crystal clear pool at the bottom – the perfect place for you to stop and catch your breath.*The waterfall is not on the trail and requires a slight detour. When you start to hear the sound of spraying water you will see a signpost for the waterfall with a small track that leads off the trail, take a short jog up and you will be blown away by this natural wonder.Photo by James Donaldson on Unsplash3. Running Route on Palaui, PhilippinesMade up of over 7,000 islands, you could spend months enjoying all of the remote and wondrous running trails the Philippines has to offer.If you only have a short amount of time for your trip then the one place you definitely need to go is Palaui. Located on the northeast tip of Luzon, the island is home to the nation’s capital and an international airport, it is incredibly easy to get to and well worth the 14-hour bus ride.The island is tiny but is home to an almost 6-mile trail called The Lagunzad Trail. The terrain is moderately difficult with some steep climbs up and down mountain peaks but the stunning scenery you get to take in along the route makes those burning climbs well worth it.The island was declared a National Marine Reserve in 1994 and gives you the opportunity to explore many untouched sites from white sand beaches and hidden waterfalls to clifftop views of the Philippine Sea – everything you could want from a running holiday this island has to offer.4. Running Route on Santorini, GreeceOne of the longest and most talked about trails on Santorini goes from Fira to Oia; it’s a steady descent for the entire trail but nothing even an amateur runner couldn’t handle.This is a great trail and really gives you a true taste of the Aegean experience. Starting at a picturesque port in Fira, it continues around the rim of the caldera to Oia on the southern tip of the island, passing through historic sights and Greek towns on the way.The trail takes you along spectacular cliff-tops giving you a stunning view of the sparkling blue Aegean sea that stretches for miles ahead.5. Running Route on Corsica, FranceThe French island of Corsica is home to one of the world’s most spectacular trails, the GR 20 that stretches across 111 miles.The trail winds its way along the jagged center of Corsica’s mountain range. Despite the rugged and mountainous terrain, the trail is within the capabilities of most runners.Your starting point is in Calenzana and the trail goes all the way down to Conca but the section mapped out is just 16 miles and ends in Haut-Asco. This northern part of the trail is great if you just want to go for a run rather than spend days trekking the length of the Island.The entire trail is incredibly well marked with red and white blazes so there is no chance of you getting lost as you run through the breathtaking scenery.6. Running Route on DominicaIf you’ve ever wanted to explore the jungle then Dominica is the place to go for your next ‘runcation.’ No poisonous snakes, no scary spiders, Dominica has some of the friendliest jungle in the world and the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail runs through it all.Segment four of the trail stretches from Wotten Waven to Pont Casse and is a great place to get in your run.The trail is shadowed on either side by an abundance of towering trees, buttress roots and dangling vines. One of the most spectacular waterfalls on the Island, Middleham Falls, is on this segment of the trail, the perfect place to stop and catch your breath or cool off and go for a swim.The terrain is moderately difficult, regular rainfall means you might sometimes find yourself slipping and sliding down hills and the jungle landscape means you will have to watch out for tree roots and branches ready to trip you up as you go.*There is a US$12.00 fee for a day pass to get on the trail.7. Running Route at Grace Bay, Turks, and CaicosIf the jungle isn’t really your thing and you’d rather be running across white sand beaches at sunset then Turks and Caicos is probably the island for you.Home to some of the clearest waters and softest white sand beaches you’re ever likely to find, Grace Bay beach is the crown jewel of the Caribbean.As you run along the beach looking out at the ocean, just a mile offshore you can see the protected reefs through the crystal clear water. The beach itself is always pristine (no rocks, seaweed or pollution in sight) and has been named the most breathtaking destination on the globe.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/volunteering-in-madagascar/,Volunteering in Madagascar,Madagascar,"Wooden huts, sand under feet, a cold water tap among the free roaming chickens; if you’ve never visited a developing country or been anywhere out of your comfort zone it’s hard to know what to expect.  When I first walked into the local village on Nosy Be, Madagascar everything was completely alien to me. There were no tower blocks, no electricity pylons, no supermarkets, no roads; just smiling locals and open fires.I was in Madagascar to volunteer with the organisation Frontier. I’d had to arrange my flights but my transport once there and accommodation were to all be arranged by their staff. Had it not been I would have been at a complete loss on arrival in a foreign country with little knowledge of the language! After an internal flight, 30 minute truck ride and a boat ride I arrived on camp – it certainly felt remote.Nosy Be where we were based is a small island, just off the north of the main island, and we were lucky enough to be right on the coast. When the tide was in I went to sleep to the sounds of waves breaking and then woke to the sounds of the chickens which had been attracted by the cooking of breakfast right outside my hut.I was in Madagascar as a wildlife conservation volunteer so I got to venture into forest which bordered our camp on a daily basis to see a variety of different animals including lizards and frogs. Our walks often involved wading or even swimming through water which could seem daunting as you didn’t know what might lie beneath the surface. But the heat of the day meant the cooling water was a welcome change. Night walks were my favourite experience; with only the moon and my head torch for light we ventured off the paths in search of the elusive mouse lemurs. We crept around as quietly as we could until we saw the sparkle of an eye hidden among the leaves up in the trees. Although mostly they only sat still and ate the leaves and fruit they found, I was fascinated by the small shy creatures and could have stood for hours just watching them.Courtesy of Marcel BootOur own camp was just as basic as the villages which bordered it but that was part of the charm of living there. I enjoyed embracing the relaxed and simple lifestyle just as much as the project itself. Some days we had our meals cooked for us by a local woman and her family. We got to sample Zebu and freshly caught seafood from on our doorstep. It was inspiring to watch them cook food, sometimes for up to 30 people, all on open fires and see the delicious dishes that they created.There were three other projects, aside from mine, based in the same camp. It meant getting to meet a variety of other volunteers from different backgrounds but that all had similar interests. The Marine conservation volunteers often rose earlier than us in order to get ready and take a small boat to whichever site they were diving in that day. We both had lots of species to learn and used books to try and memorise them so that we would be able to identify them in the field.  The teachers walked to neighboring villages or took a boat to the nearest town to help out in the local schools and often worked on new ways to engage with the children. During the breaks from working, everyone would relax on the beach or sit in the shade to read or take a dip in the sea when the heat got too much.Whilst I was there I also got to meet the children and local families as Frontier held an Environment Day in the village. Children from all around the area came together to play and learn. Although I knew they came from less privileged circumstances, they were very happy children and it was great to see them enjoying themselves and learning important lessons which will help them conserve their environment for the future.All in all the experience of volunteering in a developing country is one that can bring many benefits both to the local people and to yourself and is something I wouldn’t hesitate to do again. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/myanmar-tourist-spots-we-saw-on-our-myanmar-honeymoon/,Myanmar Tourist Spots we saw on Our Myanmar Honeymoon,Myanmar,"I chose a Myanmar honeymoon because it was a place that’s thriving with culture, history and plenty of things to do. Myanmar Tourist Spots include temples, pagodas, and markets. Its activities include hot air ballooning and visiting with its fascinating and sometimes curiously different people, but not many people see this place as being a top tourist destination. One reason for that is because it’s often overshadowed by other destinations such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Thailand.That being said, this helps to make it more unique and if you are after that luxurious travel experience then you should certainly give it a go. It’s a completely different way of life and this is reflected in my travel story. It was the start of one of the best weeks of my life. If you’re interested in taking the trip yourself then you can find out some of the top things you should do, listed below.Image by LoggaWiggler from PixabayTable of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Hot Air Balloon RidesMandalay PalaceHsinbyume PagodaTake a Walk on U-Bein BridgeInle LakeVisit Bogyoke Aung San MarketWhat to buy in Myanmarshan umbrellasthe longyiFrom Inle to IndeinKayanFood in MyanmarPodcastHot Air Balloon RidesBagan was once the capital of the ancient kingdom known as the Pagan. It’s now one of the top tourist destinations and visitors from across the world gather there to see the glorious, man-made wonder. More than 10,000 Buddhist pagodas, temples, and monasteries were built in the plain of Bagan alone. To this date, there are well over 2000 of them left and this is an otherworldly view to say the least.I was lucky enough to be able to see all of this from a bird’s eye view by simply taking part in one of the hot air balloon launches. This is one of the highlights of my trip. The whole thing lasted around 40 minutes and you are given a talk and guided by a professional team.I actually arranged the whole thing at the hotel reception desk, but basically you are picked up from your hotel (in our instance, this was just before the sun rose) and you are given a hot drink while you wait for the balloon to be ready. The coffee left something to be desired, but when we got off, we were given some champagne and a croissant (way better). The price for all of this came to more than I thought it would at first, but that being said, the experience was worth every Kyat!Mandalay PalaceThis is the last palace of the famous Burmese monarchy. Coming from England, this was something I was pretty interested in. It’s got a walled fort that is actually surrounded by a moat. As we were guided around the palace, you can easily feel the presence of gold. It was everywhere, in the halls, in each room and it even made up some of the picture frames too.It’s very easy to see the Burmese culture up close and personal here, with various religious elements that really showcase everything that the palace stands for. I thought the throne room would have been a bit more exquisite or luxurious given the theme of the palace but actually it was tasteful and simple. The main colors were deep red and gold, and the whole complex is faithful to the design when the palace was actually built.There are some modern elements since the palace has been reconstructed but when we went around, we didn’t feel as though they stood out or even that they were obvious. In fact, they tie in nicely and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The fee when we went was 10,000 Kyat per person, which again we felt as though we got our money’s worth there.Hsinbyume PagodaAnother place we visited was the Hsinbyume Pagoda. India is known for the Taj Mahal, but Myanmar actually has its own version. It can be found on the western bank of the Irrawaddy River. The pagoda is painted entirely in white and it’s dedicated to Princess Hsinbyume. She actually died in childbirth and the pagoda has been a famous tourist attraction ever since.When we went to visit this location we couldn’t stop taking photos because the place is so photogenic, especially if you go at the right time of the day. The light hits it in such a way that it makes it truly awe-inspiring so my one bit of advice for you is that you take a quality camera with plenty of battery. You’ll need it.Take a Walk on U-Bein BridgeAt one point, we felt as though we wanted to be closer to nature. That’s why we decided to take a visit to the U-Bein bridge. This is located just out of Mandalay City and for us, it was a fairly easy location to visit. The bridge is actually the longest bridge in the world that’s made entirely out of teak. It’s around 1300 yards long and it goes across a breath-taking lake.We decided to visit this location at the end of the day as it seemed like a romantic way to finish the evening. This was a great idea because, at sunset, it’s an incredible sight to see.We also managed to have a few quick conversations with the locals as well. They live their lives around the lake, so it was great to get their insight on the area and what they do on a day to day basis. This was our first real interaction with the people of Myanmar, and it was certainly a good experience.Inle LakeThe trip from Inle Lake to Yangon is very easy to make. It’s also easily one of the most incredible and stunning lakes in the world. It’s got some incredible scenery and it’s also got fantastic views of the local rustic houses. If you want to see this lake, then you should really take one of the wooden boats. The locals do this, and we really enjoyed it.The boats are quite slender so make sure that you don’t have too many items with you when you go. We only had a backpack and a camera so it wasn’t too bad for us, but I can imagine why it would be a problem for those who really want to hit the markets. The people who run the boats say that the best time to go would be during the sunset or sunrise, but we got there around lunchtime, so we missed out on that. I do have to say that the best part about taking a boat ride is that you can see the entire local village unfold before your very eyes.As you go past you may even see some fisherman. They showed us a rowing method that looks more like a magic trick. They maintain perfect balance on the boat while they use one leg to row. They then dip the fishnet into the water to try and make a catch. It’s rather hard to explain but if you see it for yourself then you’ll probably be as mesmerized as I was.Visit Bogyoke Aung San MarketAnother location I’d like to point out is the Bogyoke Aung San market. It’s a touristy location but that didn’t put us off. It’s a major bazaar and it’s located in central Yangon. The cobblestone streets do take their toll on your ankles though so make sure that you take some comfortable footwear with you. If you don’t then you may end up really regretting it. The one thing that I can recommend is shoes that have a good level of ankle support. If you don’t have anything like this then make sure that you buy some because we spent hours here.There are hundreds of stalls and stores, some of them sold art, clothing items, jewelry and more. We did see some people advertising black market money exchanges, and people were clearly interested in doing this when we went but it’s probably not the best way for you to get a good rate. The market also had food items, gourmet goods, and even medicine too.What to buy in Myanmarshan umbrellasIf you’ve heard about the famous shan umbrellas, you can find them here. We didn’t pick one up as we couldn’t carry it with us on our trip, but looking back, it’s a big regret. They were incredible with vibrant colors.the longyi If you walk around Myanmar you may see that a lot of people wear the longyi, which is actually unisex. Men and women wear clothing items very differently though, according to the customs of the area. Different patterns often cater to different sexes. This garment has become so popular over the years that market stall owners often sell them to tourists. We didn’t pick one up, but I can certainly see the appeal and if I ever get the chance to go back, I totally would.From Inle to IndeinThe journey from Inle to Indein is fun because you’ll go between narrow and (very) overgrown waterways. You’ll also be given the chance to meet boatmen and local farmers along the way too. When you go through Indein, you’ll see tons of ancient stupas. They are colored in white, brown and red and they are all lined up. Some of them are newly restored with very interesting details. This makes the journey more interesting.KayanIn Kayan, women wear huge brass rings around their collar. They were told to do this from a very young age, and it was a privilege to meet some of them. The idea is that the collar bones become deformed and that the upper ribs move to try and make their neck longer. You’ll be able to recognize them instantly, and they do take great pride in their culture.As we went through the Kayan village, we saw a lot of women weaving and craft shops too. Of course, the locals were very welcoming, and they were all too happy to show us how they weave and the techniques they use. They didn’t speak English but the great thing about the Kayan language is that it takes a lot of inspiration from various other languages, such as Malay, Chinese, and English.I made the effort to learn a few words before making the trip, which the locals seemed to appreciate, and it made the whole interaction way more fun. Sure, my pronunciation might have been a bit off, but all in all, it was a fantastic experience and it’s something that I will never forget.Food in MyanmarNo travel post would be complete without a food section. Myanmar has a lot of specialty food and I made the effort to look them up in advance so that when I arrived, I knew what everything was. Shan Noodles are a specialty and they are often eaten throughout the day, for lunch, dinner or even as a snack. This dish is ultimately a combination of very thin noodles and chicken. I did have a meal with pork once, that had a clear broth. It tasted a lot like pepper, which was synonymous with the dish. The strange thing about this dish is that it doesn’t matter how many times you order it, it seems to taste different every single time.Another food that I would highly recommend is Burmese pancakes. These are fantastic for breakfast because if you go to the right place then you will find that the texture is super smooth and that the edges are very crisp. Totally worth it.So, if you are embarking on a trip to Myanmar, you should note that there are two seasons and that they are very distinctive. There’s a wet season and a dry season. During the wet season, the area is completely inaccessible because there are very strong winds and heavy rainfall as well. The dry season is certainly the time that you should be going at because it’s the best time for you to catch that glorious hot air balloon.PodcastLearn more about Myanmar and what to see and do by listening to Travel to Myanmar – Amateur Traveler Episode 354.﻿﻿Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/10-best-street-foods-must-try-southeast-asia/,10 Best Street Foods You Must Try in Southeast Asia,Myanmar,"If travel is all about exploring the rich history and local culture of the places you visit, to have a great travel experience you have to indulge yourself in the diverse activities that those places have in store for you. One of the best ways to do this is to delve mouth-first into the local delicacy and wow your tongue with all the pleasant taste of popular foods.If you’re currently visiting or planning a trip to Southeast Asia, then you absolutely have to try the food. The hustling and bustling street food vendors are an integral part of the daily life of Southeast Asian countries. You can get an insight into the ingredients and spices Southeast Asians use in their food when casually conversing with the local people.These are the top street foods which you cannot afford to miss in your next expedition there:1: Boat Noodles (Kuay Teow Reua) – Bangkok, ThailandTo visit Bangkok and not have Boat Noodles should be considered a crime. These small bowls of soup noodles served with a sprinkle of the key ingredient (pig’s blood) has a rich history and cultural aspect attached to it. This dish was originally served from the boats of the huge canal network that Bangkok used to have, and thus the name. While having pig’s blood in their bowl of noodles may discourage some people, the blood gets cooked almost immediately. It comes in touch with the hot broth and gives the dish a unique creamy texture which you’ll only find in Bankok cuisine.While there are vendors selling boat noodles at almost every street corner of Bangkok, ‘Doy Kuay Teow Reua’ near Victory Monument is one of the best places which continues to serve this dish in its original form.2: Green Papaya Salad (Som Tam) – ThailandGreen Papaya Salad is an extremely flavorful and spicy salad made primarily with green papaya, Thai bird’s eye chili and shrimp paste. The dish originates from the North-eastern or Isan region of Thailand. However, you can find varieties of this dish all over Thailand. If you want to taste this dish in Bangkok, you can head over to a place called Som Tam Jay So, which serves a replica of the various versions of Som Tam you will find in the Isan region.3: Stir-Fried Pork with Holy Basil (Pad Kra Pao ) – ThailandThis is a staple food of many office goers and local people of Thailand, and in Bangkok, you will find some of the best versions of this dish. The street food vendors of Bangkok have taken this everyday dish to a mouth-watering level, and while visiting Bangkok, you cannot waste an opportunity of tasting this delicious stir-fried dish. It is served with a side of fried egg and steamed rice. Just mix the rice with a bit of meat and egg, and you’ll be in taste heaven.4. Sticky Rice (xôi) – VietnamThe Vietnamese know how to prepare rice in various ways. In the streets, you would find the sticky rice that could have a sweet or salty taste. There is the sticky corn rice (xôi bắp), common in northern Vietnam that is comprised of softly cooked corn mixed with rice then topped with green mung bean and tasty fried shallots. This style of preparation makes it sugary. The salty one (xôi mặn) is comprised of rice, dried shrimp, green onion, and Chinese sausage stirred with oil and flavored with soy sauce.Explore rice in Vietnam and find out what it tastes like when various ingredients are is mixed with it. You will be surprised.5. Roll Cake (Bánh Cuốn) – VietnamJust like a sandwich in the west, Vietnamese like to get creative with whatever they put in rolls of food. This is evident in their popular roll cakes known as (Bánh cuốn). The rolls are made of thin slices of baked dough. There are two different styles of roll cake that you would come across in the streets. There are those filled primarily with pork meat known as (bánh cuốn nhân thịt) and those filled with steamed rice served with spicy fish sauce, bean sprouts and herbs known as “bánh ướt” (wet cake). They are normally sold on moving carts. If you spot one, hurry up and catch it before it gets away!6: Green Tea Salad (Laphet Thohk) – MyanmarAt the street side tea stalls of Myanmar, you’ll often find various salads that you can have with your tea. Among those, the unique and popular salad is the Laphet Thohk. It is a salad made with pickled tea leaves, peanuts, tomatoes, green chilies, lime juice, and different sauces. The end result is a very unique, tangy, spicy, saucy mixture, which you must try while you are in Myanmar.7: Chinese Style Barbeque – Yangon, MyanmarThe Chinese colonies of Myanmar play a huge part in its culture and history. So your journey to Yangon will be incomplete if you don’t pay a visit to the Chinatown of Yangon. The 19th street of Chinatown, which is popularly known as the Barbecue Street, is famous for its street food vendors selling Chinese-style barbecued goodies. Just grab a table, order whatever looks nice, have a beer and indulge in the action-packed environment.8: Pork/Chicken Adobo – PhilippinesThis may be the most popular dish of the Philippines, and you really need to try it while you’re there. Tender pieces of meat marinated in vinegar and soy sauce, this dish is easily available on the street side, and it is a great experience to have this famous dish in its homeland.9: Banana-Q – PhilippinesAll you sweet lovers must not miss the opportunity to taste this extremely popular evening snack of the locals of the Philippines. The dish is made with a local variety of banana called ‘Saba,’ which is coated in brown sugar, deep-fried and then skewered on a stick like a piece of barbecued meat. You can find this dish everywhere throughout the Philippines, especially during the evening time.10: Balut – PhilippinesThis might not be the most appetizing street food you can have while you’re in the Philippines, but it is almost certainly the most unique one. Balut is a developing duck embryo, still in its shell, boiled and eaten in one gulp. It is considered an aphrodisiac by the locals, and though not for the faint-hearted, still it is one of the most unique street food experiences you can have in the Philippines.That’s my list of awesome street foods to look for as you go about your adventure in Southeast Asia.

https://amateurtraveler.com/warm-nights-in-a-mongolian-winter/,Warm Nights In A Mongolian Winter,Mongolia,"Although more than 1 million people live in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, everything feels sparse.The area seems too large for the city’s buildings and its residents, the power cuts out so frequently that the outages go unacknowledged, and all the food comes drenched in ketchup (including the ubiquitous noodles).Black MarketOn the second day of my brief stay, some other travelers and I visited the city’s Black Market. To say it was chaotic would be an understatement: People climbed over garage doors to get in for free and, the moment I entered, I was almost knocked over by two women carrying mattresses on their heads.Inside, there were “sellers” of all kinds: TV remotes, fireplaces, carpets, sacks, hats and, best of all, those who sold whatever they had managed to lay their hands on — a sheep’s knees, a flaking dominoes set, three football pin badges, a pair of miniature Buddha statues, a sword and a wooden riding saddle.Turning into an alley, I met a man hacking the head off a goat with an axe. Stepping over the blood, I moved into the hardware section, where I negotiated a path through the chainsaw demonstrations and into the food court. Here, there were lumps of butter the size of my head; the cheeses were even larger. Before I had a chance to buy anything, I collided with women pushing palates of bloody meat. They were followed by children pushing the organs, thus completing the grim procession.Lost in UlaanbaatarAfter a few hours of drifting through the mayhem, we chose to walk back to the hostel. We crossed the main road using the underpass, and then decided to take a “shortcut.” We turned off of the main road past a series of disheveled playgrounds; there were no swings attached to the huge metal hooks, so the frames resembled horrifying torture devices.Twenty minutes later, we were lost.With mounting concern, we walked through a rough housing estate. Above our heads, groceries hung from the windows to keep them frozen. Meanwhile, at ground zero, there was only rubble and dust.“Do you think we should turn back?” asked a woman in our group, her hand gripping her wallet through her jeans.“No, I think we should press on,” replied another.Now I knew we were in trouble. We had begun to talk as if we were at war.We followed a bridge across a patch of water, which was filled with trash. On the other side, we could just about make out mountain peaks through the haze of smog emanating from nearby factories.“Look!” exclaimed one member of our group, pointing to the hills like a character from Lord of The Rings. “We’re going the right way!”“How did you work that out?” the man at her side fired back.“Because the hills are over there!”“Yes,” he groaned. “But how does that help? We haven’t seen them before, so we don’t know where they are.”He was right, of course, so we silently dropped back into line.The only good thing about getting lost is the euphoria you feel when you find your way. On this occasion, we did so by luck rather than judgment: To our surprise, a random alley led onto the main road. Even then, one group member pulled a map from his pocket, to ensure we weren’t taking any more chances.That evening, we stood on the hostel balcony and gazed out at the cityscape. It was a bewildering mix of old apartment lots, factory smoke, fenced yurts, building sites and white hills — all boxed in by a thick wall of smog. We all had had enough of the city and were happy to be spending the following few days in the countryside.Gorkhi-Terelj National ParkThe next morning, we hired a minivan to take us there. Before long, the city was just a haze behind us and we entered the dusty land of limbo, which separated the city from the countryside.A few hours later, hills emerged in the distance. The mid-morning sun reflected the sky to give their white peaks a blueish tint. With the brake pressed to the floor, our driver negotiated a slushy slope toward a small camp of yurts.Gorkhi-Terelj National Park is only about 80 kilometers northeast of Ulaanbaatar, but it felt as if it was another country. The soaring mountains made everything seem minuscule; including our hosts who came out of their yurts to greet us with big grins.A Night in a YurtMongolians have been living in yurts since the 6th century, and it is thought that as many as 40 percent of the population still live in them today. We were to spend the next few nights in one, so were happy to discover they were much larger inside than they looked. There was room for six wooden beds, which were neatly arranged around a large black stove.That evening, I discovered the stove got extremely hot. Unable to sleep, I threw off my blanket and clutched the steel bedposts in an effort to cool my body. Then the door swung open and my body relaxed with the breeze. A figure entered carrying an armful of coal and firewood; he added this to the stove, making the heat even more intolerable.The next morning, a fellow traveller named Jim — one half of the British honeymooning couple who had opted against a beach holiday — asked me if I had felt hot the night before.“Very,” I replied.He shook his head.“I don’t want to sound ungrateful, but if that man comes in again tomorrow night, I’m telling him not to add any more firewood. Honestly, I could hardly take it.”The rest of us nodded our flushed faces in agreement.Mongolian HorsesLater that morning, we were scheduled to ride some Mongolian horses.Our excitement faded somewhat when we discovered the horses were out of breath and overweight. We climbed onto them all the same and, 30 minutes later, our camp disappeared from view as we moved into a land of white isolation — the only sign of civilization was the odd, solitary yurt.I had envisaged cantering through the countryside, but instead our horses refused to do anything but walk slowly. We tried everything to make them trot:  First shouting “choo!” as our guide suggested, and then whispering into their ears. Finally, we yelled at them in English (which was not suggested by our guide).By the time we arrived back at the camp, the sun was descending. Cattle wandered into their evening pens, dogs yapped as the cows clomped toward them, and a toddler hit the dogs with a stick before being lifted off her feet by her laughing mother. Everything was happening in slow motion; the plodding animals, the people working, even the birds in the sky seemed to fly at a slower pace.Warm Nights in WinterThat evening, we drank a few beers in our yurt, then shut the door, and turned in for the night.Twenty minutes later, it was boiling hot.The door opened and a pile of wood hit the floor.An English voice travelled through the darkness: “We’re very grateful, but please don’t put any more wood on the stove. We don’t need it.”Ignoring this, the man opened the stove.The English voice became more frantic, “Honestly! We don’t need it.”In response, the man dropped the wood into the stove and shut the door behind him.Coughing through the heat, I headed outside.Moments later, I was joined by the others, who also had decided that standing in their underwear in the snow was preferable to lying inside in the furnace.“I tried to stop him!” Jim said.“We heard you,” another replied.“I don’t want to be ungrateful,” Jim repeated. “But the heat is too much. I mean, it’s so hot in there the candle has melted — and it wasn’t even lit.”Feeling giddy, I dropped to my haunches and pressed my hands into the snow. One of the girls wiped the sweat from her face with the back of her arm. Framed by the backdrop of snowy mountains, she looked almost comical. However, this was one of the reasons I enjoyed traveling so much: You could never predict what might happen. Here we were, in the Mongolian countryside in the middle of winter when the temperature was -20 degrees, and inexplicably, we were all too hot.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-mission-mongolia-by-david-treanor/,Book Review: Mission Mongolia by David Treanor,Mongolia,"David Treanor and his buddy Geoff Stayton where two journalist at the BBC News department in London. They have been there steadily for over 25 years growing their careers and friendship. But one day all of a sudden, 3000 jobs were about to be cut and they were offered an early-retirement package which they promptly accepted rather than become middle-aged unemployed editors in an industry where new technologies where thriving.As both friends where sitting on a bar gulping a few beers to figure out what they were going to do with the rest of their lives, David spotted an article in a newspaper where he read a story on a charity named “Save the Children” which raises funds by selling vehicles driven to Ulaanbaatar and assisting local abandoned kids with the profits. As Geoff returned to the table with a new round of brewskies, he was greeted with the news: “We’re going to Mongolia!” And to Mongolia they went!Neither of them was an adventurer, a camper, a car mechanic aficionado, knew any language other than English or was an avid outdoorsman. Yet, they went for the adventure and obviously made it, since one of them is telling the story.Of course that is not recommended to just pick up a van and drive to Mongolia with no preparation. I do believe that either these two were extremely lucky to make it all the way to Ulaanbaatar or the author just kept some stories private in order not to enrage his wife.This is a light book about two buddies travelling through the unknown, figuring out life as they move on through their 8,000 mile journey. The narrative is extremely funny and it reminded me a lot of Bill Bryson’s travel books. Treanor has a knack for explaining situations in a way that without a straight-out joke he just makes you laugh out loud as you can picture him facing odd situations.The trials and tribulations of this duo through Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Russia and Mongolia are wonderful. The clash of cultures, friends met along the way, dealings with different languages and alphabets in remote border crossings and their problem solving skills when ordering food and beer in foreign lands are worth the read.If you have an adventurer’s soul, even if you haven’t been to many adventures lately, you will surely enjoy this narrative and wonderful experience. And if you don’t, at least you’ll laugh along the way.Mission Mongolia – Non FictionThis review was originally published on Lectum Ergo SumShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/our-travels-sherry-ott-traveled-to-mongolia/,Our Travels – Sherry Ott Traveled to Mongolia,Mongolia,"Sherry Ott in MongoliaAfter listening to Travel to Mongolia – Amateur Traveler Episode 111 Sherry Ott was motivated to go to Mongolia.  We caught up with Sherry to see why someone would do that, and what she thinks of Mongolia after going there.Mongolia – wide open spacesWhat about Mongolia caught your imagination?The idea of open spaces and nomadic life; it has the honor of having the least population density in the world.  I had been living in Ho Chi Minh City at the time, which was one of the most densely populated cities in the world; I was craving open space.  I was fascinated with the herding, nomadic culture and that it was still actively practiced in such a modern world.  Finally – I recalled hearing about the annual festival of on the podcast.  The culture of horse racing, archery, and wrestling fascinated me – I immediately had a desire to go experience it!Mongolia Naadam Festival – wrestlingWhat surprised you about your trip?I was most surprised about how families lived together in a small tent (ger) with no plumbing or ‘rooms’.  When you go to Mongolia you leave your privacy at the border.  If you go and really experience the nomadic life then be prepared to not have personal space.  It’s an odd concept coming from the land of huge homes where family members can simply go to their room and shut a door.  There are no doors except one in the ger…and that’s the front door.  But because of this, the families were so tightly intertwined, it was beautiful to see.Mongolia Naadam Festival – wrestlingWhat was the highlight?I was traveling through the Gobi Desert and even though it was the beginning of August there were still Naadam celebrations going on in small villages  (Naadam – Mongolian Manly Sports) in the Gobi Desert even though the main event in the capital of Ulaanbaater had long passed.  My jeep driver notified me that Naadaam was taking place in the village we were in and I was overjoyed.  After hearing about it on the podcast, I wanted to see it.  I loved the smaller scale of the festival in the village; all of the villagers came out to watch the competitions and they included me in the ceremonies of sharing and drinking airag (fermented mare’s milk) and allowed me to shoot away with my camera.  I watched in awe as men pummeled each other wrestling on the hard Gobi ground and young kids race at high speeds bareback on horses for 15 kilometers.Mongolia Naadam Festival – wrestlingWhat is your best tip for travel to Mongolia?I like to immerse myself in a culture – so my tip is to do just that.  I suggest that you look into the trips that Ger to Ger puts together (Ger to Ger – Cultural Travel in Mongolia).  They aren’t upscale trips – these are trips that have cultural immersion as the goal.  You will see how families live on a daily basis in their gers, see how they survive off of herding, and you will be welcomed into their lives.  One of the philosophies of Ger to Ger is to really have travel be a cultural exchange – so they make you travel from ger to ger via local transportation.  That way you really get to experience the lifestyle, plus the locals also get to experience you and get more exposure to foreign cultures.  But – if you decide upon this mode of seeing Mongolia, then be prepared to rough it; eating noodles and mutton for a week was totally worth it to me!Mongolia moving dayWhat is your favorite picture of Mongolia?Just one?!!!I came across this family of 7 moving their ger in a big truck.  Everything they owned, including their ‘house’  was in that truck and they were all going to ride in it together to their new nomadic destination!Mongolia toilet with viewWhat is one unique thing about Mongolia?There are no bathrooms in the country side.  So you better be prepared to do as locals do…squat wherever you can find your privacy!Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/sightseeing-in-malta-an-island-of-fortresses-and-cathedrals/,Sightseeing in Malta – An Island of Fortresses and Cathedrals,Malta,"The island nation of Malta in the middle of the Mediterranean sea was a pleasant surprise. Sightseeing in Malta includes an abundance of fortresses and Cathedrals. The megalithic temples of Malta date back to the stone age.Malta can be a paradise for hikers, history lovers and sun-worshippers alike. It has an interesting history with numerous rulers – the Greeks, the Arabs, the Hospitallers, the Romans, the Normans, French, and British – brings a vibrant diversity of culture and food that is unique to this special European destination. Barakka Gardens View – Valletta, MaltaTable of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Plan for the WeatherBenefits of Travel in MaltaHighlights of MaltaSliema and St Julian’sValettaThe ‘Three Cities’ and Nearby FortressesMdinaMostaHagar QimOther Megalithic TemplesBugibbaGozoMelliehaTop Malta Travel TipsPlan for the WeatherDespite the windy weather in the month of March when I first visited Malta, the fact that the beaches were a little chilly to enjoy was not an issue. I was predominantly there for the Churches and architecture. Do factor in the weather and time of year when you make your plans to visit Malta – the best time of year is between May and September. However, there is so much to explore on this small island that you will not be bored. If you are hiking, you may prefer to avoid the hottest summer months.Benefits of Travel in MaltaMalta is extremely easy to travel around. The main language spoken is English making it an easy option for travelers. The currency is the EURO and so you can quickly get used to the money. And did I mention that it’s so easy to get around by public bus? Spend at least 10 days exploring this wonderful island and of course, its sister island of Gozo.Highlights of MaltaSliema and St Julian’sThe majority of tourists visiting Malta stay in Sliema and St Julian’s just a little further North from the capital of Valetta. They tend to have a lot more going on in the way of hotels, bars, and nightlife than the historical capital of Valetta, which can tend to be a bit quiet in the evenings. From Sliema, you can take the ferry to Manoel island to visit Fort Manoel.Castile Palace – Valletta, MaltaValettaValletta, known as “a city built by gentlemen for gentlemen” is Malta’s capital city. A working city and the administrative and commercial heart of the Islands, Valletta a lot of titles, all recalling its rich historical past. It is a “modern” city made by the Knights of St John; a masterpiece of the Baroque; a World Heritage and a European Art City. These days, it is one of the most highly concentrated historic areas in the world. The city is busy every day, yet it has a timeless atmosphere by night, which gives the feeling that you are going back in time. The grid of narrow streets shows some of Europe’s finest churches, artworks, and palaces.Valletta is copiously rich in sites to explore and see, fascinating historical buildings around every corner such prayerful statues, fountains, niches and coats of arms up on parapets. The slender side streets are full of tiny quaint cafés and shops, whereas Valletta’s main streets are lined with bigger international branded shops for music, fashion jewelry and lots more.The ideal way to get around and see as much as possible is on foot and although the options to do and see are plentiful, a good start and definitely one that shouldn’t be missed are Valletta’s lovely gardens. The Hastings Gardens, Upper Barrakka Gardens, and the Lower Barrakka Gardens are just three of the most well-known ones, although on further exploration a lot of hidden gardens can be found. Make sure that you time your visit to the Upper Barraka gardens with the free Canon fire display that takes place at noon. It really is a spectacular show!St John’s Co-Cathedral & the museum are certainly not to be missed, as this extravagantly adorned church is home to world-famous artistic masterpieces by Mattia Preti and Caravaggio. While the Co-Cathedral doesn’t seem like much from the outside, the inside will surely impress with its gold plated interior and marble tombstone floor.Apart from gorgeous Baroque churches other places of interest consist of the various grandmaster auberges, museums, and piazzas. Jump on one of the walking tours of the city, or simply stroll and absorb it at your leisure.The ‘Three Cities’ and Nearby FortressesDon’t let your sightseeing of Malta’s capital stop in Valetta’s old town. Take a ferry across to explore the three fortified cities of Birgu, Senglea, and Cospicua in Malta. My advice is to take a boat to Kalkara and visit Fort Ricasoli. You can then explore the three cities on foot from there if you don’t mind a bit of walking.Cathedral in MdinaMdinaMdina, known as Malta’s ‘Silent City’, sits above a hill overseeing many of the neighboring towns. This tiny city is reinvigorated and boasts a diverse mix of Baroque and medieval architecture covering the quaint narrow streets. Inhabited in the past by noble families, many of the residences have been passed down through the generations and are still associated with the wealthier. Tiny, deceiving doorways embedded in tall walls lead to properties with vast interiors. Nicknamed the ‘Silent City’ due to its quiet streets and strict vehicle restrictions, entering Mdina is like going back in time.The main entrance to Mdina, known as Mdina Gate or Vilhena Gate, is a fine example of what to find beyond it. Dedicated to the Patron Saint of Malta, St Paul’s Cathedral is Baroque in style and was built in Mdina in the 17th century. Designed by architect Lorenzo Gafa, the cathedral took five years to build. The impressive interior of the cathedral holds an ornate vault, gilded and with an arched ceiling of paintings of St Paul’s Shipwreck as depicted by artists, the Manno brothers. Surrounded by detailed stone masonry and marble, the interior of the cathedral is even more overwhelming than its beautiful exterior.If you are excited by the concept of exploring underground, don’t miss the catacombs – an underground labyrinth containing tombs and galleries that date back to around the 8th Century.MostaWhile Mosta isn’t one of the top tourist spots to come up in your research when you’re planning your holiday on the Maltese islands, it definitely has a very beautiful gem to offer: Mosta Rotunda. The Rotunda of Mosta is one of the most famous churches in Malta, situated in the central village of Mosta. The church façade has a portico with a total of six Ionic columns and is bordered by two bell towers. Its key feature which gives it the name of a rotunda is a spectacular dome with an exterior height of 61m and a diameter of 39.6m, making it a feature in most rooftop panoramas around Malta. The dome itself is unsupported and for a time was the third-largest in the world. The interior is also stunning, painted blue, gold, and white and decorated with rich colors and stunning statues, stucco moldings, and gilded and decorative elements.When it comes to the time for religious celebrations, the Mosta is one of the churches which is most famous for these Christian traditions. One of these is the Good Friday procession in which a number of people choose to wear the kunfratija – a white or black full body cover to indicate piety and penance. Many also walk the procession barefoot as a sign of remorse for their sins. A less somber and more fun occasion is the feast of the Assumption of Our Lady, which is held every August 15th and is a notable holiday island-wide.Hagar QimThe temple of Hagar Qim stands on a hilltop overlooking the sea and the islet of Fifla and is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. 18th and 19th-century paintings that show off this temple show that Hagar Qim wasn’t completely buried as the tallest stones, remained exposed. The site has a central building and the remnants of at least two more structures. The colossal facade of the central structure and large forecourt follow the pattern characteristic of Maltese Prehistoric Temples. Along the external wall, you may find some of the largest megaliths used in the building of these structures, such as a 5.2m high stone and a huge megalith estimated to weigh close to 20 tonnes. The building is made up of a series of C-shaped rooms, also known as apses. Going through the main entrance, you can see a central paved space with an apse on either side. A number of clay and stone statuettes of obese figures which have been discovered in this temple can also be seen at the museum.View from Mdina wallsOther Megalithic TemplesIf you still haven’t got your fix of ancient temples in Malta, there are plenty more to explore. On Malta, venture to Tarxien, Scorba, Ta Hagrat, and Mnajdra.You should also visit the Hal Saflieni Hypogeum – a burial complex cut into solid rock and built by the same people who built the prehistoric temples it once held approximately 7000 bodies for up to 1000 years. The Hal Saflieni Hypogeum is a UNESCO World Heritage site. As visitors are limited to 10 an hour, you must book in advance to avoid disappointment.Next head of to Gozo, Malta’s sister island by ferry to explore Ġgantija and Santa Verna. The Ggantija temples are important because they are the earliest of Malta’s megalithic temples. More on Gozo later!BugibbaBuġibba is a village by the Northern coastline of Malta and forms part of a bunch of villages together with Qawra and St. Paul’s Bay. It’s one of the most well-known tourist destinations in Malta and attracts tens of thousands of visitors every year.Even though Buġibba isn’t a normal Maltese village and has little in terms of history and culture, it’s a good spot for people looking to combine holiday comfort with exploring the country. Being a prevalent village among tourists, Buġibba is a fairly quiet place during the winter months and busy (for local standards) during the summer months. With the large majority of tourists in Malta being UK citizens, you’ll find a few English-style pubs and bars in the area. It’s a popular destination for couples of all ages and families with children.Buġibba provides a variety of hotels to suit all different budgets, with the exception of luxury hotels. There’s an artificial sandy beach, placed on a fairly rocky shoreline. It’s a clean beach that’s popularly visited by the tourists that are staying in the area.If you’re traveling with children there is a great aquarium in Bugibba that is worth a visit to learn about the sea-life of the area and of the rest of the world.Mellieha BayGozoDuring your stay in Malta, it will certainly be worth taking a trip to Malta’s sister island – Gozo. Take the ferry across to visit Gozo from Cirkewwa (Malta) to Mgarr (Gozo) for just a couple of Euros to discover the delights of Malta’s sister island including the Citadel, Blue Lagoon beach, and Gozo Cathedral.The production of sea salt is a long-standing tradition on the island of Gozo. You may be interested in seeing the ‘Salt Pans’ of Malta which are laid out in geometric patterns jutting into the ocean. It makes for a beautiful early morning coastal walk.Although public transport (buses) isn’t as good as on Malta itself, there are plenty of options to rent bikes and a car on the island. You can also join tours by quad bike, jeep, and even tuk-tuk!MelliehaMellieha Bay in the North of Malta and a great destination to stay for relaxation and beaches. Mellieha town is perched on a hill and there are several interesting points in Mellieha including to Parish Church, air raid shelters and a hidden Church underground. You can also walk up to visit the Red Fort. Mellieha is a good place to be based if you want to see the historical sites in Malta but also combine this with a trip to Gozo, as the ferry port for Gozo is not far from Mellieha.Mdina MaltaTop Malta Travel TipsSpend at least 10 days to 2 weeks if possible, but you will still be able to cover a lot of the main sights within a week.Use the public buses to get around Malta.Hiring a car? Drive on the left!The currency is the Euro – take some Euros along with your credit card which you will be able to use in most places.Take the ferry across to Gozo to see the Citadel, Cathedral and Salt pans.The local dish is… rabbit!Regarding visas – Malta is located in the Schengen Zone of Europe.Tipping is usual in Malta for taxis and good service in restaurants (roughly 10%)Plugs are the UK Type G – make sure that you take those or a converter.Topless swimming and sunbathing is not allowed in Malta – it is a strongly Christian country.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/experience-the-old-and-modern-mediterranean-culture-in-malta/,What to do in Malta,Malta,"Often viewed simply as a rock in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, Malta is easily overlooked as a travel destination. Having a reputation as a package holidaymaker’s paradise, somewhere middle-aged Brits can enjoy a bit of sunshine without forsaking the comforts of home, Malta is not known for its appeal to the more adventurous traveler.But beneath the veneer of gentility, there is another side to Malta. One that blends history and culture with a modern Mediterranean lifestyle. True, unless you’re staying in the hotel complex that is known as the town of St Julian’s, Malta’s nightlife is on the sedate side, but unless your idea of a good time is downing vodka shots all night, there are lots to discover in Malta.VallettaFew tourists stay in Malta’s capital, Valletta, instead most join the locals by taking one of the regular ferries from Sliema to the city. The trip is short and well worth it for the views it provides of Valletta.Once you disembark from the ferry it is just a short walk into the city center, where you will be engulfed by narrow medieval streets. Most of Valletta was built within 15 years when the locals decided they needed a fortress city to protect their island and started construction in 1566.Even today, most of Valletta is made up of these traditional buildings and it is great to just wander through its old cobbled streets and find a back-street cafe to stop for a drink and something to eat. Alternatively, Valletta has many sights worth seeing including a cathedral that features original artwork by Caravaggio, a palace, harbors, churches, and museums.HistoryPeople have been living in Malta since prehistory and many of its archaeological sites make Rome’s historic buildings look modern. For history-buffs booking a place on one of the tours to the Hypogeum is a must. This is an underground network of halls, chambers, passages and even a temple, which were carved out of rock and dates back to 3,600 BC.Above ground, head up to Mdina, which is one of Europe’s greatest examples of an ancient walled city. Once home to Malta’s noble elite and even now many of the town’s residents are descendent from these families. During the day Mdina’s architecture, history, and palaces attract hordes of tourists but at night it still relies on lamp light and becomes ‘the silent city’.Boat tripHead to the Sliema harbor in the morning and you will be spoilt for choice for the number of boat trips on offer, most of which offer the chance to see one of Malta’s main attractions – the Blue Grotto. The Blue Grotto is a series of natural caves and caverns that can only be reached by small boats, but its main appeal is the fact that its water ranges from phosphorescent colors to deep dark shades of blue.Alternatively, avoid the tourist crowds by renting a boat and exploring the island’s many bays and beaches by yourself. It will also give the opportunity to visit the famous Blue Lagoon on the neighboring Comino island.ActivitiesIts mild climate makes Malta a prime spot for outdoor enthusiasts. Not surprising being an island, water sports are a major activity in Malta.Its clear, clean and calm waters make it a prime spot for divers and Malta, along with its sister islands, offers numerous diving opportunities, there are also many diving schools located on all three islands. It is not just the warm Mediterranean Sea temperature that draws divers to this area, as many come to explore the island’s reefs, caves, and wrecks.If you prefer to stay above water, then how about sailing? This is a popular pastime with tourists and locals alike and sailboats are a regular feature on Malta’s horizon. If you prefer something more active then there is water skiing, wakeboarding and paragliding to choose from.For those who would rather stay on dry land, the island’s many cliffs offer great climbing and abseiling spots, while there is also the opportunity to try caving. Away from the towns, Malta’s terrain and wildlife also make it a great place for hiking and cycling.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-things-the-guidebooks-wont-tell-you-about-malta/,7 Things the Guidebooks Won’t Tell You About Malta,Malta,"In most parts of Europe, Malta is known and promoted as a summer holiday destination that enjoys sunny and warm Mediterranean weather. If you dig a little deeper though and peel back a few layers you’ll find that there’s much more to this small island nation that makes it a great addition to your travel bucket list. Below are some of the things about Malta that you might not find in any guidebook.1. Megalithic Temples in MaltaA few of the Megalithic Temples in Malta, such as the Tarxien Temples, date back to around 5000-3000 BC, making them the oldest free-standing man-made structures in the world, older than Stonehenge. Most of the temples undergo regular restoration and preservation works and are open to the public, with guided tours offered in various languages. Archaeologists have it that the megalithic complex came up due to local innovations in a cultural evolution process.2. Movie production – Popeye, Troy and parts of Gladiator were filmed in MaltaMalta, a very beautiful Island is well known to draw big-budget filmmakers who are attracted to the beauty of this city. Over 50 filmmakers have used Malta as a backdrop for their movies. Some examples of movies shot in Malta include:Popeye (1980)Pinocchio (2002)Swept Away (2002)Alexander (2004)Troy (2004)Munich (2006)The da Vinci Code (2006)Filmmaking in Malta dates back to 1964 when the Mediterranean Film Studios were opened. The studios have extraordinary deep and shallow water tanks, which offer an exceptional backdrop for any filmmaker. Apart from filmmakers, TV advertisers, commercials and series also use the water tanks for filming. Malta is both scenic and historic with picturesque shorelines and open seas for quality filmmaking. The distinctive integration of Malta’s sunny shorelines and architectural history create an exceptional ‘Hollywood’ of the Mediterranean.2. Maltesers were not invented in MaltaMaltesers are spherical malt honeycombs surrounded by thin milk chocolate layers. Commonly found in Japan, Ireland, and the United Kingdom, Maltesers are simply a lighter way of enjoying chocolate. Originally, they were referred to as Energy Balls, an invention of Forrest Mars back in 1936. They derive their name from two words ‘malt’ and ‘teasers’. Regardless of the spelling, Maltesers have no connection with the Maltese people or the Malta city. Maltesers remain popular with people of all generations who value their great taste.4. Culture of OppositesA big part of Maltese culture is choosing a side and opposing the other. Whether it be politics (Malta has two major political parties, the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party), soccer/football (it’s either England or Italy that gets the support from the majority of the Maltese) or local band clubs (as part of annual village feasts, originally a religious celebration). The Arabs, Romans, and Phoenicians have all left a touch on the traditions and customs of Malta’s history. Malta is generally a nation of opposition and opposites and while the people are mainly welcoming and friendly, they have a level of opposition of sides majorly in local band clubs, sports, and politics.5. 98% Of the Maltese are CatholicDespite popular belief that Malta is an Arab nation (and its population therefore largely Muslim), the vast majority are raised as Catholics, although the number of Maltese who actively practice their religion is rapidly declining. The only link to Middle Eastern countries is possibly the Maltese language, which is strongly influenced by Arabic. Malta Island is commonly known as the Island of the Catholic “Arabs” with 98% of the entire population being Roman Catholics. While 98% of the country recognizes the freedom of religion, Roman Catholicism is identified as the state religion in Malta’s constitution.6. A popular local softdrink: KinnieMalta is famed for its locally-prepared non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks especially the Maltese beer and Maltese wine. Kinnie is a popular local soft drink that has reigned on since 1952.  There’s no other way to put it – Either you love Kinnie or you hate it. This soft drink is produced locally, has a bittersweet flavor and is made up mostly of bitter oranges and herbs. Kinnie can be bought from any supermarket or bar and makes for a great mixer with several types of liquor.  Kinnie could be referred to as Malta’s national drink because its recipe is purely Maltese and it sells out more than any other drink on the Malta Island.7. Delicacies in Maltese cuisineAlthough probably a little unusual to most of us, typical delicacies prepared in Malta include rabbit, quail and horse meat. Rabbit is widely prepared and considered a traditional dish. Maltese cuisine is characteristically Mediterranean comprising fresh seafood. The cuisine is the outcome of a long-standing relationship between the Maltese and many invaders who inhabited the Islands for many years. This assimilation of tastes has given Malta an assorted mix of Mediterranean cooking. Though many restaurants offer specialty foods, many eateries offer local foods served in different versions. Some of the common traditional Maltese foods you will not miss out on the menus include the fish pie (Lampuki pie), rabbit stew, beef olives (Bragioli), Maltese ratatouille (Kapunata) and widow’s soup that includes goat and sheep cheese (Gbejniet) among others.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/soneva-fushi-maldives/,"Soneva Fushi, Maldives",Maldives,"Maldives BeachOriginally uploaded by deckchairIt was the ultimate touchdown. After a fabulous flight in a seaplane, over hundreds of little islands, emerald and platinum jewels set in a sea of turquoise, we came down with a whirr and a splash into the middle of a tropical ocean. Kunfunadhoo Island, our destination and home to Soneva Fushi Resort, is one of the biggest islands in the Maldives, but still too small for a landing strip. But this was a much more glamorous way to arrive, and much more suited to the romance of the setting.Soneva Fushi is ridiculously romantic, it has to be said – the stuff of every clichéd island fantasy. There are pristine white beaches, balmy blue waters, and a lush interior full of dappled shade and leaves whispering in the breeze. This is one of those rare places that manage to pull off the feat of being luxurious and unpretentious at the same time. You sit down for a five-course dinner served with fine wine, at a table glowing with candles and crystal, but under the table your bare feet sink into still-warm sand. This no-shoes attitude plays a big part in making Soneva Fushi feel so relaxed – it’s hard to be stressed when there’s sand between your toes at all times.In effect, our front garden was a private beach. A mother hen led her chicks across the sandy space between the hedges each morning, clucking protectively. And every evening, a rabbit came out to play, a surreal Watership Down silhouette against the waves. Being there was like sitting in a secret world, with a sandy lawn that led to a sunlit sea, with another secret world to enjoy beneath the waves. For those looking for pampering and diversion, the resort has a spa and a boutique and diving and tennis and windsurfing. But I had all the pampering and diversion I needed, what with hens and rabbits and waves breaking and palm fronds swaying and feeding the birds that came to call. They sang beautifully for their suppers – the crumbs of the feasts enjoyed at the table on my very own patch of beach-garden.Champagne breakfasts at first light and seafood lunches go a long way to keeping a girl happy between books and bobbing about in balmy waters under a tropical sun. In fact, I was totally over-scheduled. So much to do and so little time to do it in – I had to fit in walks around the entire island at dawn and at sunset, as changing light and colour splashed across the water and the sand. And daytime wanders through the shady and enchanted glade that made up the interior. And a most memorable barbeque, on a long and lonely spit of sand a short boat ride away, where cold white wine was drunk as fires were lit and fresh fish grilled as the sun went down, throwing a shimmer over the gentle waves that lapped at this whole world away from the world.Bekim blogs normally at HotelMee.com.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/a-natural-wonder-sipadan-island-malaysia/,"A Natural Wonder – Sipadan Island, Malaysia",Malaysia,"A local dignitary recently said the island of Sipadan, Malaysia, is a “gem beneath the sea.” Off Semporna, on the east coast of Sabah, Sipadan Island is renowned among professional scuba divers for its pristine and wondrous coral reef and spectacular marine life. It is also known for its beauty above its ocean depths, with plant life and migrating birds that give the island an explosion of color and richness of nature. Jacques Cousteau once called it an “untouched work of art” and it was recently placed on a list of 261 nominees for the New 7 Wonders of the World online campaign along with other natural wonders, such as the Grand Canyon and Niagra Falls in the U.S. and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.The beauty of Sipadan is somewhat of a secret to those who are not serious scuba divers. To get to the island you must take a boat from nearby Mabul or Semporna as the resorts on Sipadan were shut down a number of years ago to help protect its delicate ecosystem. The island was originally formed from a coral reef and today’s divers enjoy viewing both hard and soft pristine coral with visibility depths of 60 to 200 feet. Thousands of species of fish swim amongst the coral and an abundance of turtle species can be spotted above and below the island. Sipadan was designated as a bird sanctuary in 1933, and dedicated bird watchers flock to the island to view the 47 different species. A dense forest tops the island rich in orchids, bromeliads and pitcher plants. Sipadan is an explosion of tropical flair ready for exploration for those who want to enjoy the beauty of untouched nature.This is probably the best place in the world for swimming and diving with turtles. Along with swirling schools of barracuda, roaming sharks and more than 3000 fish species is an abundance of sea turtles, most of which are the Green turtle. The turtle is actually a blackish-brown or green-yellowish color and can grow to four feet long. Other turtles on the island are the Leatherback, Olive Ridley and Hawksbill turtles. Even though turtles are listed as endangered in Malaysia, there is an abundance in well-protected Sipadan. So much so, that Sipadan dive operators guarantee sightings on their tours. Divers have reported sightings of up to 30 turtles in a single dive during the month of August. Late summer is the peak egg-laying season, but year-round the four species of turtles use the island as a nesting site. Turtles enjoy floating atop the water feeding on algae and sponges and sometimes rest on wall ledges. Divers can explore Turtle Cavern tucked inside a 70-foot wall of coral where an abundance of turtles can be found swimming about ready to interact with a curious visitor. To get to the cavern, you must go to what’s known as the “Drop Off,” one of the best beach dive sites in the world. Only 20 feet from shore, the wall plunges a dazzling 2,800 ft. Also mingling along the wall are plenty or lionfish and smaller reef fish.A colorful explosion of fish species can be found scattered amongst the glorious groupings of coral. Known as one of the “big fish capitals of the world,” Sipadan offers sightings of the giant bumphead parrotfish, trevally, whales, mola mola, hammerhead sharks, swirls of barracuda, manta rays, moray eels, the plentiful and pretty nudibranchs and many more. It is a celebratory moment when rare napoleon wrasse, grouper, or pufferfish are seen because it is a reassurance that these threatened fish species have not all been fished out of the seas or eaten. Diving sites pepper the island, including Barracuda Point where you can find yourself in the middle of a spiraling vortex of barracudas so big that the light from the sun is sometimes clouded out. At the South Point diving site, you’ll see herds of large marauding bumphead parrotfish, scores of reef sharks, and massive schools of trevally. With rich currents sweeping by the ocean smaller fish travel in and out which brings bigger fish and even more fish, sharks, turtles, and the occasional whale.An infinite variety of corals await the keen diver looking for one of the most exciting diving spots in the world. Sipadan is the jewel in the crown of diving in Malaysia. Sipadan sparkles with tropical flair from the spectacular coral reefs and profusion of colorful fish that swim amongst it. The reef is fragile, however, and in 2004 the Malaysian government restricted diving to only 120 per day users in order to preserve the sensitive ecosystem from being overrun by tourism. On this tiny, remote island that measures only .5 km long and 200 meters wide, Sipadan Marine Park helps protect this natural treasure. Glorious coral, such as Gorgonian fans, sea whips, and feather stars set a spectacular backdrop to the island’s colorful palette of fish. The island is known to have the largest variety of soft coral in the world.On this tiny oceanic island less than a mile from the mainland, the list of attractions is staggering and amazing to behold. The Malaysian government works hard to preserve the glorious, untouched nature of its prize jewel, Sipadan. It is truly the ultimate nature escape and if you visit your eyes will feast on a glory of nature beyond your most vivid dreams.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/amsterdam-by-bike-a-dutch-experience/,Amsterdam by Bike – A Dutch Experience,Netherlands,"There are many different transportation options in Amsterdam – car, bus, metro & tram, but perhaps the best one is the option most of the Dutch themselves choose, that is a bicycle. Many first-time Amsterdam visitors are intimidated by the thought of biking in the city. It can be scary thinking of sharing the city’s streets with tram & auto traffic, as well as having to wade through a considerable amount of foot traffic as well. Following a couple simple tips can make seeing the city by bike a safe, simple & unforgettable experience.Vondelpark is a great place to get comfortable1- Start simple. It’s is probably going to be easier to get used to the feel of the bike and where it’s gears and brakes are if you’re in a less crowded area. Biking up to Central Station via Damrak, one of the city’s busiest tourist streets, is possibly the worst introduction to biking in Amsterdam one could ask for. Instead, head for the beautiful, more open areas of the eastern and western canal belt. Another easy thing to do while getting your bearings is to make sure you start on roads with designated bike paths, which are easier to bike on than regular roads or the cobblestone streets that are all over the city. Vondelpark, Amsterdam’s large urban park located out by the museums is another excellent place for beginners to start getting comfortable.Tram tracks- a biker’s nemesis2- Watch out for the trams and tram tracks.  A good rule is to never ride your bike close to tram tracks going the same direction they are going. It’s too easy to get distracted and if the tires of the bike make it into them, it’s almost a certainty that the bike will stop going forward. At best you’ll get a hard stop, at worse, you could be thrown from the bike. This isn’t that hard a rule to follow- most of the streets with tram lines either have bike paths far away from the tracks or make such lousy streets for biking that you’ll get off them soon anyway. Also, listen for the distinct clanging sound of the trams, especially when crossing intersections- always give them the right of way.This bike looks like it may have been locked up for a while 🙂3- Lock your bike up. Any bike rental place in Amsterdam is going to provide a good lock, show you how to use it, and reiterate a number of times how important it is to lock up your bike, even if just popping into a shop or restaurant quickly. There will always be something around to chain the bike to- and you’ll see bikes affixed to just about every type of non-moveable object in the city.4. Don’t try to be like the Dutch right away. It’s easy to see why this rule is important- most of the Dutch you see riding bikes in Amsterdam have years and years of experience at it. It’s very common to see them biking and talking on the phone or texting, or carrying people or large objects on the front handlebars. Some ride around with oversized bags on their backs. Again, they are pros at this, you are not- don’t follow their example.Stay aware of the flow of traffic- it’s not hard to do5. Follow the flow of traffic. The most common mistake tourists make in this matter is stopping the bike in the middle of a bike lane to check a map. If you have to do so, do what any sensible person would do when driving a car, signal (using your hands) and get over to the side before pulling out the map. Hand signals, while not too commonly used by the Dutch themselves, are a great way of letting fellow bikers know your intentions. 6. Take a bike tour if all else fails. Biking on your own may prove too much for some people, so there are plenty of tour companies where experienced guides will shepherd bikers of all skill levels around on a dizzying array of tour options. While most people will soon find the freedom of being on their own on a bike in Amsterdam, it would be better to take a bike tour than not to try it at all.My friend Toni, loving the freedom of biking in Amsterdam7. Have fun with it. Once you have the feel for it, the biking around should be fun. There’s no need to race off anywhere. Explore neighborhoods you wouldn’t have seen on foot. If you are even more adventurous and have the bike rented for multiple days, get outside of Amsterdam to one of the small cities that are a couple of hours ride by bike. On the way, you’ll get a glimpse of scenic Dutch countryside, farms and, of course, windmills. If you don’t feel like biking back, most trains will allow bikes (during non-peak periods).Author’s Note: There are a ton of bike rental outlets in Amsterdam- I’ve always had a good experience with the people at Bike City in the Jordaan. Besides being friendly and knowledgeable, the neighborhood provides a much less congested starting point that does many of the outlets around the Dam. (This recommendation is unsolicited- I’ve never received a discount or compensation from Bike City.)Here’s a little YouTube clip I made from footage I took with my Go Pro camera on my last biking excursion in Amsterdam in April of 2013.[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qfLfDNmmK4&w=560&h=315] Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/scandinavia-travel-for-first-timers-what-to-expect/,Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect,Norway,"Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect?Scandinavian countries stand among the most perfect destinations for a getaway as they combine all you need for a wonderful vacation: picturesque landscapes, cutting-edge cities, outstanding cuisine and adventurous spirit. If you’ve already made up your mind to explore the motherland of Vikings for the first time, you should know a couple of facts about this marvelous region to avoid some pitfalls and make your Scandinavia travel even more pleasant and memorable.No money, no honeyThe first thing that’s impossible not to mention is that this Nordic region may astound or even shock some visitors with its, at times, skyrocketing prices. Norway, in particular, is the most expensive country in the world with average salaries of 4665 euros per month, so it’s not that hard to imagine that the prices there – and in Scandinavia on the whole – can bite. Good news: there are some ways to save money and travel around Northern Europe without breaking the bank. You can cut back on your costs by joining a pre-planned small group tour, buying multi-day transport tickets instead of single fares, saving on accommodation by choosing to stay at hostels or simply by getting food in local supermarkets instead of dining in posh restaurants. In any case, Scandinavia is not a budget destination, so it’s better to plan the trip carefully and keep an eye on your spending in order not to squander all your money during the first two days.One more fact about money is that Scandinavia is becoming more and more cashless, thus the most convenient and wise payment method is by card.Unpredictable WeatherMost people believe that Scandinavian climate tends to be cold and severe, but that’s not entirely true. Everything depends on the season and region you’re going to explore. If you’re planning a summer trip, you may be pleasantly surprised by mild and warm weather with temperatures of 21-23°С during the day in the southern regions, and by the shiny midnight sun during the night in the north. Polar day is a usual phenomenon in northern Norway and Sweden as some parts of these countries are located beyond the Arctic Circle, meaning the sun doesn’t go down the horizon in the summer months and can be seen 24 hours a day.Winters are also not that severe in the majority of Scandinavian capitals. For instance, the average winter temperatures in Oslo and Copenhagen are only about -3/-5°С due to the proximity to the Gulf Stream. However, if you want to fulfill your dream-come-true to visit the Santa Claus residence in Lapland, stock up with warm sweaters as you’ll have to travel in the frosty conditions of -15/-17°С.Unexpected Masterpieces and Hidden GemsScandinavia is not only about natural marvels like breathtaking fjords, tiny islands and frozen lakes. The region boasts fascinating cities and lovely villages that have their own special charms. Green parks of urban Helsinki, Hans Christian Andersen’s heritage in Danish Odense, the majestic Stockholm Royal Palace, numerous museums of Oslo… there’s no end to Scandinavian attractions that are worth visiting. But it’s sure that you’ll come across even more hidden gems than you expected to see. The brilliant example of Scandinavian creativity and love to beauty is the Stockholm subway. It’s considered to be the world’s longest art exhibition as 90 of the 100 stations are decorated with fantastic paintings, sculptures, and mosaics, created by more than 150 artists.Scandinavian cities also have a dense impressive collection of street art. There are even tours on the urban murals that are sometimes painted on the facades of buildings in the city centers. Some of them have deep meaning, some are painted just for fun. Anyway, Scandinavians just love to turn boring structures into real masterpieces.Scandinavian Design and Decor – MinimalismComing to Scandinavia, you can’t help but notice the free and easy spirit of the Viking descendants. The main trend of living is minimalism which pervades every aspect of everyday life: from the clothing they wear to how they decorate their homes to their attitudes toward food.The inventors of Ikea and H&M, Scandinavians do their best to simplify their lives. It’s unlikely that you’ll come across lots of people wearing sophisticated colorful clothes for the reason that Nordic people put comfort above all. They mainly give preference to basic clothes and comfortable shoes but combine them in the way to look trendy and cool.The same simplicity can be seen in Scandinavian decor. The typical interior uses light pastel colors diluted with bright accents. They also keep a strong relationship with the elements and nature. Passionate about the idea of harmony and eco-friendliness, Scandinavians employ lots of wooden items in their homes: from furniture to floors and windows.As for the way of cooking, you’ll be surprised about how delicious simple meals can be. Nordic cuisine boasts an impressive variety of dishes based on fresh organic products. So visiting this region offers a perfect opportunity to savor the taste of healthy foods prepared in the best traditions of local chefs.Cycling – Scandinavian CbsessionThe people of the European North are true nature lovers and put much effort into the protection of the environment. Traveling around the cities, you’ll witness the huge number of cyclists and that’s not a coincidence. The most ‘cycling’ Scandinavian capital is Copenhagen where you can borrow a bicycle for any period of time absolutely for free. Moreover, the citizens ride bikes in any weather conditions, even in winter. The main arguments in favor of bikes are the reduction of emissions in the atmosphere, mobility and health benefits.Scandinavians also practice a responsible approach to waste processing. For a couple of decades, citizens have been accustomed to sorting garbage: almost near every house there are containers for paper, glass, metal, plastic, food and unrecoverable waste which helps these countries to remain in the top of the most ecologically sound countries in the world.All in all, Scandinavia offers a number of attractions and features to fall in love with. No doubt that the trip to this spectacular region will leave lots of lovely memories and impressions that eventually can become the reason to come back, maybe more than once. This article is a sponsored by firebirdtours.com.Share this: "

The 9th World Ranger Congress (WRC) had me off to exotic Asia to the countries of Nepal and Bhutan. Both are fascinating countries.

It was 13 hours to Guangzhou (Canton), China, and then a 4-hour flight to Kathmandu.There are great views of Everest and the Himalayas between Guangzhou and Kathmandu provided you get a window seat on the right side of the plane. Pilots flying into Kathmandu airport require a special training certificate due to the airport being on a Mesa in a valley at the foot of the Himalayan mountains.It is a 13.45-hour time difference to California which wasn’t too bad maintaining contact with home. I have no idea about the 45 minutes! I’ve read it has to do with Nepal being 4 degrees of longitude off which they jokingly call “Nepal stretched time” and never makes them late by making them 15 minutes early to everything.I was greeted at the airport with a Nepal ceremonial scarf (Khada) signifying compassion, not unlike the custom of being presented with a lei upon arrival in Hawaii. Namaste!Facts about NepalNepal is 90% Hindu and 10% Buddhist despite Buddha being born in Nepal. Nepal opened for tourism in 1951. They drive on the left side of the road. The unit of currency is the Nepal Rupee, about R111 to the US dollar (2019). The Thamel district of Kathmandu is a pedestrian-only back street tourist shopping district. Dinner can be had at the Thamel House Restaurant which specialized in Nepali and Newari foods. It’s the former 150-year-old wood residence of a Newar craftsman. I would recommend the Nepali Ghar Hotel as a place to stay.Lukla Airport NepalLukla, NepalI flew to Lukla (Tenzing Hillary Airport), Nepal, at 9,338-foot elevation. It is the “Roof of the World”, the gateway to Everest and Sagarmatha National Park. It is the most extreme airport in the world; coming in at treetop level, landing over a 2,000-foot abyss and one of the highest airports in the world built by Sir Edmund Hillary. Lukla has no cars, foot traffic only. This is a very busy airport with over 50 airplane arrivals and 50 helicopter flights a day. Planes and sightseeing helicopters are constantly landing and turning around in 15 minutes.Lukla is a small village dependent on tourism. People from all over the world are here. This is the starting point for trekking to Everest Base Camp or climbing Everest. One-hour helicopter sightseeing flights to Kalapathar (above Everest Base Camp) are expensive unless you can share the cost. It was a beautiful day and I got to see Everest up close. Everest was declared the highest mountain in 1852. My helicopter reached 21,000 feet above sea level with an outside temperature of -9 degrees.The afternoon left me time to trek out a couple of miles on the Everest base camp trail walking in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Hillary. I took a loop trail starting down a 1000 “step” trail to Chaurikharka and looping up to the Base Camp trail. The trail is very busy, a foot freeway, with trekkers, Sherpas, and mule or Zupki (ox) supply trains. I did well with the altitude but did have many rest stops when my heart started pounding too fast. What a great adventure.I stayed overnight at the Himalaya Lodge owned by the town’s go-to resident, Dawa Tshering Sherpa. The only downside was no heat and it’s cold at this elevation. Apparently, none of the hotels have heat.Kathmandu, NepalThe next morning, I flew back to Kathmandu. While waiting in the Lukla airport, I thought I was in an emergency room. So many of the trekkers were coughing like they all had bronchitis. Speaking of breathing issues, Kathmandu has very poor air quality. Let this be a health warning to anyone with respiratory issues, you should probably avoid Nepal. It caused me problems.Royal Narayanhiti Palace MuseumBack in Kathmandu, I visited the Royal Narayanhiti Palace Museum. It was the site of the massacre of the Nepal royal family in 2001. It houses the Crown Jewels and the usual palace rooms including the Throne Room. The current structure was built in 1963 but has been the site of the residence since 1846.That night, I went to Bhojan Griha for a traditional Nepal dinner. I was entertained with traditional folk music and costumed dances of the Sherpas and Gherkas. The building itself was 160 years old and served as a royal palace for the priests.I had a two-day tour of the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Site. The site is composed of seven properties. Most of the properties were being restored after the 2015 7.8 earthquake. Hanuman-dharma Durbar SquareThe first property I visited was Hanuman-dharma Durbar Square which contains an ancient wooden palace, Hanuman Statue (Red Monkey Hindu God), and various temples with intricate wood carvings all dating back to 1563. In addition, the House of Kumari is the home of a female child (4-year-old) known as the Living Goddess of Nepal. She presented herself to me from a balcony and I received her blessing.The valley was divided between three grandchildren who were each given their own city to rule, Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur. Being siblings, they tried to outdo each other with their Palace Square or Durbar. This was the first. The second property is Swayambu Stupa where the Buddhist Saint Manjushree found a lotus flower in the center of a lake, drained the lake, and established Kathmandu.Monkey TempleA stupa is a Buddhist temple that has prayer wheels you walk left around the Stupa spinning and chanting “Om Mane Padme Hun” which means “hail to the jewel in the lotus.” It is also called the “Monkey Temple” due to all the Assamese monkeys on the grounds. You get a good view of the city of Kathmandu from here despite the polluted air.The third property is a Bhudda Stupa built in the fifth century and is one of the largest in Nepal. Here you will find a school of Thankas (tantric Buddhist paintings). They are intricate, detailed, vividly colored, beautiful, and painted with cat hairbrushes.Pashupatinath TempleThe fourth property is Pashupatinath Temple dedicated to Shiva and built 500 years ago. This temple is the holiest Hindu temple in Nepal. The grounds along the sacred Bagmati River serve as a cremation site known as Arya Ghat. I encountered at least three cremations occurring and one body openly being prepared for cremation.Patan Durbar SquareThe fifth property is Patan Durbar Square, the second grandchild’s city. It is known as the city of “Beauty”. It’s known for its artists, craftsman, and metal workers. The Patan Museum (a temple) contains examples of metal sculptures. The square contains Buddhist monuments, Hindu temples, a Golden Temple, and guardian risqué statues. The royal palace has a royal bath with two snake statutes running along each side and 102 wooden hand carvings of Buddha’s hand and finger positions (AKA the original emojis). The palace and temple all have Golden Doorways.Bhaktapur Durbar SquareThe sixth property is Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the final grandchild’s city. It is known as the city of ” Devotees” and is the oldest of the three founded in 889 AD. It contains many of the same types of buildings as the other two with the exception of a five-tiered temple. One temple had a wooden gate that was exquisitely carved that the king had the craftsman’s hands cut off and buried nearby so he could not create another. The palace has 55 wooden windows. There is a working pottery kiln.Changu Narayan TempleThe seventh and final property is Changu Narayan Temple, a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu, perched on a hill. It is one of Kathmandu’s oldest shrines. There was a religious ceremony occurring while I was there, and the ladies were all dressed in traditional attire. After visiting all these cultural properties, there sure is a lot of steps in this town. And the street merchants were like flies.Shivapuri Nagarjun National ParkI took one morning and hiked in Shivapuri Nagarjun National Park. I took a hired 4WD jeep up a one-lane narrow dirt track to the top of Shivapuri Peak at 8963 feet and hiked straight down to 4429 feet. At the top, there are clear views of the Himalaya range. I saw a Barking Deer and Kalij Pheasant.Interestingly, the ex-king’s palace home is inside the park and I had to go through four military checkpoints. The third checkpoint had a machine gun nest. Poachers don’t seem to be a problem at this park. Also, I learned Nepal doesn’t have park rangers, per se. The parks are patrolled by a special Army unit trained for park work.Sarauha, NepalMy next destination was Sarauha, Nepal. I got there by bus. It was unique to see working elephants transporting materials and the town rhino just walking down Main street on a daily basis.I had three safaris around Chitwan National Park which is a World Heritage Site, Nepal’s first national park, and one of those “places to see before you die”.Budhi Rapti RiverThe first was a Silk Cotton Tree dugout canoe. I floated about three miles down the Budhi Rapti River. We saw two Mugger crocodiles and a spotted deer.Chitwan National Park’s Elephant CenterAfterward, I visited Chitwan National Park’s elephant center where elephants are rehabilitated, breed, and recover from injuries. The second safari was an elephant walk in the grasslands of Sapana with Lucky Kali, a rescued female. This is a more ethical tourism adventure than riding the elephants which is so widely advertised. Lucky had her own mahout (handler). I helped cut the grass with a sickle for Lucky’s lunch or Kuching.Chitwan National Park Jeep TourMy third and final safari was a jeep trip through Chitwan National Park. I took a tourist ferry dugout canoe across the East Rapti River to pick up my jeep. Again, after military checkpoints, I traveled about 24 miles through the forest and elephant grass. I saw wild boar, three Indian Rhinos, Gharial crocodile, spotted deer, and peacocks. The final stop was the park’s Gharial crocodile breeding center.My return to Kathmandu was not uneventful. It’s a narrow two-lane valley/mountain road. There was an oil tanker truck that overturned and kept everyone parked for about 2.5 hours.Nepalese FoodNepalese food is spicy, and most people are vegetarians. However, I tried wild boar, water buffalo, Momo (beef dumplings), Sherpa Soup (vegetable), yak cheese, and Dal Bhat (lentils, rice, and veggies). For libation, I drank Raksi (a 60% distilled beverage which is much stronger than its hot water over millet version, Tongba), Nepal Ice lager beer, Gorkha beer, Himalaya Red beer, Chang (milky white authentic Sherpa beer), Sherpa Beer (ale, commercialized in name only), and milk tea.BhutanSaying goodbye to Nepal, I flew into Paro, Bhutan, another top extreme airport. You fly up the valleys of the Himalayas banking left than right as you come in housetop level into the airport.Facts about BhutanBhutan is the “Land of the Thunder Dragon” (Druk Yul). The fabled land of “Shangri La”. It’s a strict Buddhist country. Here you experience their “gross national happiness” (which really wasn’t that apparent) and it is definitely the safest country on the planet.Bhutan was first opened to foreigners in 1974. It is the size of New Hampshire and Vermont combined. The first vehicle arrived in 1962 with the first paved road. There is a twist in the road every 27 seconds and traffic lights are prohibited. They also drive on the left side of the road. Television came in 1999. Tobacco and plastic bags are illegal. Their currency is the Bhutan Ngultrum which runs about N70 per US dollar (2019). You get a better rate if you exchange US$100 bills than $20.Nepal is cheap compared to Bhutan. The population is about 800,000 with 60% of that under 13 years of age. There are dogs everywhere and I only saw four cats in the entire country. English is understood fairly widely here as it is their mandatory second language. No one outside Bhutan speaks Bhutanese, so English appears to be the better choice when traveling internationally for Bhutanese.Bhutan’s constitution mandates preserving 51% of its natural heritage in protected areas. Peak climbing is banned as the peaks are spiritual. Trekking on long-distance trails is allowed.Paro, BhutanAfter leaving the airport, I checked into Kangku Resort and headed off to the National Museum. I was surprised to see the extent of wood carved deity and animal masks used in their cultural dance.Below the museum is the Ta-Dzong, the watchtower over the Rinpung Dzong (monastery fortress) built in 1645 with more superb woodwork.Taktsang Monastery (Tiger’s Nest)My first full day was an adventure in endurance. I hiked 1,700 feet up a 6.5-mile trail in 7 hours to Taktsang Monastery also known as the Tiger’s Nest, located at 10,232 feet. The final section was 308 steps down and across a gorge. The approach is dangerous and slippery. The monastery clings to a sheer mountain ledge.Taktsang Monastery was founded in 1692 by a Tibetan missionary venerated as the second Buddha. Legend says he landed on the spot (a cave) from Tibet astride a flying tiger, bringing Buddhism to Bhutan. He meditated here three years, three months, three days, and three hours. It is the cultural icon of Bhutan. It was fitting to be here on this day as it was a Buddhist holiday honoring Buddha ascending to Nirvana. I ascended to this Shangri-La!Thimpu, BhutanMy hotel in Thimpu, the capital of Bhutan, was Hotel Jumolhari. After breakfast, I went behind the hotel to the Changlimithang Archery Grounds to watch archery practice. Bhutanese are noted for their archery skills. Their practice range is 459 feet. I even tried my hand at it after lunch. I wasn’t that great.Folk Heritage MuseumThe first stop of the day was the Folk Heritage Museum which preserves one of the oldest homes in Thimpu. Across the street was the National Institute for Zorig Chusum which is a government-sponsored trade school where students learn to master the many cultural artworks of Bhutan, like woodworking, pottery, embroidery, and sketching.Royal Textile Academy of BhutanThe last stop before lunch was the Royal Textile Academy of Bhutan displaying beautiful ancient and modern textiles, like wall hangings and regional clothing.Buddha DordenmaAfter lunch, I went up the mountain to Buddha Dordenma, one of the largest sitting gilded-gold Buddha’s in the world. From there, you get magnificent views of the Thimpu Valley.I had been feeling badly since I left Chitwan and my symptoms weren’t getting any better. I decided to check out their national health care system which is free to all including foreigners. I was diagnosed with Upper Respiratory Tract Infection in 1.5 hours. I received a chest x-Ray, EKG, and all my prescriptions. No cost to me. Wow, the US could really take a lesson here.At the Bhutan General Post Office, Bhutan allows you to take any photo off your iPhone and turn it into a Bhutan official postage stamp. I had two stamps made showing me at Tiger’s Nest.Punakha ValleyBack on the road for the last adventure, to Punakha Valley and the former capital of Bhutan. You drive over the 10,229-foot Dochula Pass which has a stupa with 108 miniature chortens (shrines).Just over the pass is the Royal Botanical Park administered by the Bhutan National Park System and created in 2008. It’s known for having all 49 species of rhododendron found in Bhutan. A musk deer was wandering the grounds.Chimi Lhakhang TempleI checked into the Drubchhu Resort. After lunch, I visited the Chimi Lhakhang Temple. This is a temple to a demon deity, known as the divine madman, who had overzealous behavior with women. Phallic symbols in all shapes, sizes, color, and paintings can be found for sale and most homes and businesses are adorned with phallic symbols for good luck. Hence the temple is also known as the Fertility Temple. Childless couples come here to offer prayers and are usually blessed with children. There’s a testimonial photo book in the temple.Khamsum Namgyal Chorten TempleUp the valley is the three-story Khamsum Namgyal Chorten Temple built by the Queen. It’s a bit of a climb on a trail through the terraced rice fields after crossing the Mo Chuu River on a cable bridge. As with all Buddhist temples, it had striking paintings and god effigies.Punakha DzongBack down, I had a picnic lunch at the confluence of the Mo Chuu (mother) and Phochu Chuu (father) rivers with Ruddy Shell ducks floating around. The confluence was strategically important. The Punakha Dzong (monastery fortress) was built to protect the country from invading Tibetans. It became the first capital of Bhutan and royal weddings and coronations are still held here.Tamchog Lkakhang TempleDriving back to Paro, I made a stop to view Tamchog Lkakhang Temple built by the “iron chain” monk, Thangtong Gyalpo. He built many temples and bridges made of iron chains to cross rivers. I stayed my last night at the Tashi Namgyal Resort.Leaving Bhutan, Paro’s takeoff has the plane spiral up above the airport to gain altitude to get over the Himalayas. I saw the tallest mountain in Bhutan, Gangkhar Puensum (24,836 ft.). Bidding Bhutan goodbye, I can say I hope I don’t see rice or stairs for a few months upon my return!Bhutan FoodBhutan food is also very spicy and not a lot of variety, I tried their national dish Ema Datse (extremely spicy green chilies and cheese) and red or pink rice. They really love their chilies. It’s grown and dried all over the countryside. Drinks included Lassi (yogurt), Bhutan Peach Wine, buttered tea, Red Rice beer, and Druk Supreme beer.Heading HomeArriving back in Kathmandu, I prepared for the trip home. My final dinner was at a fantastic pizza place called Fire and Ice. By the crowds and the waitlist, it appears it wasn’t a secret.A quick three-hour flight to Guangzhou, China, and I was looking forward to the McDonalds in the terminal. Sadly, a McDonalds without burgers and fries is like a bar without beer. Luckily, I got my meat fix at the nearby Burger King. Best burger ever (or at least since I left home). The next leg was 11 hours to San Francisco. I was lucky I had no rain for the entire trip (November). It was amazing the amount of Indian Hindu tourists traveling in both countries. Travel statistics for this trip were: 17,696 air miles, 39 hours in the air, 541 miles by vehicle, 127 miles on foot, and 3.5 miles in a dugout canoe.

https://amateurtraveler.com/panama-canal-trip-journal/,Panama Canal Trip Journal,Panama,"This journal covers a cruise to Panama on Holland America through Insight / Geek Cruises. The cruise was a Shakespeare cruise done in conjunction with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and a Mac cruise done in conjunction with MacWorld.Friday November 2, San Jose to FloridaThe alarm goes off very early when you are trying to be at the airport before 6am for a 6:50am flight. A close friend Brad volunteered to take us to the airport… a very close friend indeed. Although in reality it was his wife Janice who actually woke up when their alarm went off so very early in the morning.Our flights to Atlanta and then on to Fort Lauderdale were both happily uneventful and we used the time to sleep, read magazines ( I brought 2-3 inches of my backlog for this leg of the trip), or do homework (Joan). We took a shuttle ($15 a person) to the Westin Fort Lauderdale where I was surprised to find that I had apparently reserved a suite.Almost immediately after our arrival we went to a party put on by the Shakespeare at Sea / Insight Cruises program that we were joining for this trip. By the time that the evening was done we had met more people on this cruise without setting foot on the boat than we had in a week at sea on our previous cruise. Most of the crowd was older than us, some by a margin. They also were more regular or more recent patrons of the Oregon Shakespeare festival than Joan and I. I had gone to Ashland, where OSF resides, in 2006 with our kids and their high school drama group but we had not been to the festival for a few years before that. Before the birth of our kids Joan and I had gone more regularly. I had gone to Ashland with a group from my high school 4 years in a row in the 1970s. The vast majority of the people at the party were from the west coast and the majority were from the San Francisco bay area. We very quickly found interesting people to talk to. We even found some Mac people who ventured in from the Mac party and some others like myself who were fans of both Mac and Shakespeare.Before going to bed I recorded a new introduction to an old episode of the Amateur Traveler podcast for publication on November 10th.Saturday November 3, Leaving Fort LauderdaleThe ship was scheduled to leave port at 5 pm which gave us plenty of time. We slept in, booked a place on the Holland America shuttle bus ($12 a person), brought our luggage to the truck and then went to brunch. We still had time to kill before the buses started to leave at 12:30 pm so we tried to get the last little bits of email etc off the internet before we had to pay $25 an hour to connect.We met more people while we waited for a tour of the ship. Our biggest fear was that our tour guide had gotten lost. Finally Colby, one of the assistant cruise directors, showed up and led us from bow to stern, from the dining room to the theatre, and much of what was in between. We had been on one similar cruise before on Royal Caribbean on the Empress of the Seas. This cruise was on Holland America’s Volendam. The Empress carried around 1,000 passengers and the Volendam 1,400. Much of the two ships were the same. The dining room and theatre were very similar. The central atrium on the Volendam was in the range from uninspiring to ugly and garish. The Volendam has a small theatre in addition to the large theatre which is used for movies, talks and cooking classes as it has a demonstration kitchen behind the screen. The Empress had a small but nice library hidden away where you could exchange one of the books you had brought on board for one that someone else left. The Volendam tripled the size of the library, added a coffee bar, many internet stations, a DVD library ($3 a day unless you have a suite) and a decent sized library of books available for free check out. The Volendam has the usual collection of shops, bars and a casino. It does have 3 self-serve laundries. It does not have a climbing wall or equally flashy gimmick. It has two pools, the larger pool (still small) is chlorinated and the one that is on the bow and not surrounded by a wall is salt water since the water in the pool can splash into the ocean in a rougher sea. The roof on the main pool can be closed in case of rain. The Volendam also has a buffet restaurant on the Lido deck as well as an upscale restaurant ($30 per person not counting wine).Before we left port we did a lifeboat drill where all of the passengers crowded onto 3rd deck where the lifeboats are located. Women and children are still first so the men lined up in the back and the ladies in the front. Pity the person who is claustrophobic as the ships passengers just fit on the 3rd deck. Since the lifejackets have the ship’s cabin on them, the crew checked off most people as they arrived and then just called out the names of the ones they were missing. We were assured that there were plenty of lifeboats for all the passengers.At 5 pm there was a Sail Away party on the deck in the stern of the ship. There was a live band and of course cocktails as we watched the Florida coast drift away. We waved at the Pilot boat and the people on land as we chatted with more people attending the Mac cruise including Janet from Apple’s Education department. Some of the people on the Mac cruise had the cruise paid for by their jobs, which seems to make that audience somewhat more varied in age than the Shakespeare cruise. Eventually the party was broken up by strong winds that started blowing the chairs all over the deck (predominantly the ones without anyone in them).At 7 pm the Shakespeare at Sea had a cocktail party to welcome everyone. We received our schedules, listened to welcoming remarks and met still more cruise mates.At 8 pm we adjourned to the dining room for the late seating of dinner. The plan is to shuffle the tables each night among the Shakespeare at Sea attendees so that we can meet more people. I was more impressed with my dinner than Joan, so the quality seemed to depend somewhat on what you ordered.At 10 pm Joan and I went to the evening’s movie which was Evan Almighty. Only 2 other people attended although they had prepared popcorn for more like ten times that number.Sunday November 4, Half Moon CayToday’s port of call was Half Moon Cay, which is a private island in the Bahamas owned by Holland America. We tendered into the island into a man-made harbor by the beach. The beach was a beautiful beach with fine white sand. Near the beach were bars, gift shops, an information booth, an outdoor kitchen, covered picnic areas and private cabanas. We rented a clamshell to provide shade for our chaise lounges ($10). We swam in the morning, read and napped. I tried out my underwater video camera. I thought that there were no fish in the water until I found out later that I had caught one in a video. Lunch was a BBQ on the island prepared in the outdoor kitchen. After lunch we took a cycling tour of the island. It was supposed to be a guided tour but our tour guide did not actually seem to like to talk or provide information so we were not always clear where we were going or why we had stopped here. We stopped at the horse corral, at the inner lagoon (and saw some old ruined houses), and the sting ray lagoon. The pace of the group was slow but the distances were very short. Serious bikers would probably be very frustrated with the tour.After returning to the ship we went to the large theatre where we were supposed to see a new performance put on by the OSF actors but it turns out that their costumes and props had gone missing (they later turned up in Florida) so instead Bill Rauch, the new artistic director, talked about his background and then answered questions about what his plans where for OSF. He had some very interesting experiences with a theatre company called Cornerstone, which he helped found with 14 friends right out of college. They started with a mission of bringing live theatre to small towns in the U.S. but ended up morphing into a mission of using theatre to bring communities and diverse groups together.I then went to a Mac event where Randal Shwartz talked about cool utilities for the Macintosh. I had heard of most of these utilities but still picked up some interesting new ones to check out when I get home.At dinner we met still more Californians in the Shakespeare group and talked about Shakespeare, audio books, web sites (one of the group owns LovePoems.com) and travel.The evening’s entertainment was Michael James who juggled, rode a unicycle, heckled the audience and climbed an 8 foot ladder which was free standing. The audience was a bit surprised when he really rode the unicycle with a member of the audience on his shoulders. We were probably even more surprised that she went along with it.Monday November 5, At SeaOur morning started with a lecture on violence in Shakespeare from Christopher Duval. He talked about the weapons (rapier) and styles of combat in Shakespeare’s day. He also said one census from the time had 130 men for every 100 women which caused great sexual tensions which are played out in Romeo and Juliet.The next talk was again with Bill Rauch talking about the 2008 OSF season. Joan attended but I worked out in the gym instead. It is surprising that on a ship of 1400 people it is not hard to find a free machine in the gym. They had maybe 20 aerobic machines of which no more than 10 were in use at any given time.After lunch I attended a question and answer session with 4 of the actors, which Joan skipped so she could work out. The stories the actors told often left us in stitches. My favorite was a story of a production of Julius Caesar (not at OSF) where just after Caesar was killed in a very dramatic fashion with lots of stage blood, the assassins paused to let the audience take in the moment. In the silence a phone started ringing off stage. No one knew what to do until one of the actor’s ad libbed “what if it is for Caesar?”The second session was watching the film Romeo and Juliet from 1968 by Franco Zefferelli. Barry Kraft gave some introductory remarks about what to watch for in this particular production. The theatre was warm and more than one head nodded off when the lights went out. It was a good production but I was not the only one hoping that just this once it would not end so badly for our star crossed lovers.I stayed in the same theatre for another 2 hours to hear Jason Snell of MacWorld give a presentation on Leopard 101 (Mac OS 10.5). I knew much of what he was presenting but there was enough that I did not know to make the presentation (which was well done) worthwhile.Dinner was our first of 3 formal dinner evenings, so I rushed quickly from the Mac talk to the room to change and then on to the dining room. Yet again we had wonderful dinner table mates. We can’t join in the discussions on the most recent OSF productions, but also found may other things to talk about. Our table had 2 doctors and their wives (a hand surgeon at Shriner’s hospital in LA and a Ob/Gyn from Bellevue Washington). They each had a couple of stories of being asked “is there a doctor in the house… or on the plane…Tuesday November 6, at ArubaOur ship was not scheduled to arrive in Aruba until noon so I attended Robin Williams’ (not that one) class Fourth Wall? What Fourth Wall? The Elizabethan Stage. Robin showed pictures of the old globe and the new globe in London and talked about how actors in the New Globe gained new insights about Shakespeare’s plays when they performed those plays on a stage similar to that which he used. Particularly it became clear how many speeches were aimed at the groundlings who stood at the very edge of the stage. She also introduced us to the Wheel of Fortune and the Great Chain of Being and we learned the proper use of thee/thou vs you in Elizabethan English.After that I went to a session on podcasting by Randal Schwartz on the Macmania track. I can only hope that my comments were helpful as I did not go as much to learn as to share.For our shore excursion we did a sea kayaking and snorkeling trip. We had 3 very nice guides who showed us how to paddle and un-capsize a kayak (fortunately the second set of knowledge went unused). We had never kayaked before but had wanted to try it. We did not steer anything like a straight course but did manage to get to and from a park down the coast which we used as a base for snorkeling. I had brought my prescription swim goggles so I went out without a mask and snorkel which made the snorkel part of the excursion more work. There was not really great visibility but at least I was able to start getting the hang of the underwater video camera (Sanyo Xacti) that I had recently purchased. The guides made us wear life vests which just got in the way. Mine kept coming unzipped which just gave me one more thing to fuss with. We were warned by the guides that fire coral which was prevalent in the area would give us a painful and permanent tattoo should we touch it.After the excursion we walked around the port area of Aruba but only had to venture a block or so before the city started looking pretty seedy.Wednesday November 7, at CuraçaoWe had booked a cruise and snorkel excursion through http://ShoreTrips.com for Curaçao. Since we were not booking through the cruise line we were the only people from our ship on the excursion and had to wait by the port’s gate for almost a half hour after the time they had given us before the van picked us up. The van took us to Spanish Bay, which was a distance away. Unlike Aruba, much of Curaçao looked attractive and I would like to spend more time there some time. At Spanish Bay we took a Zodiac out to the sailing schooner Bounty. The ship had about 40 passengers and a crew of 5. We motored out of the bay and then raised the two jibs to sail to our first snorkel destination. There was a free open bar on the boat so I got my diet coke fix and a rum punch or two during our 5 hour voyage. The visibility was better at Curaçao than we had seen at Aruba and both the outing before and after lunch were quite fun (so fun that I did not notice how fried my back was getting in the tropical sun). After a nice lunch on the boat we motored a short distance to the wreck of a tug boat. I was able to shoot underwater video that reminded me of the Titanic. All in all it was an excellent outing which left me grinning profusely and fried to a crisp.Thursday November 8, at SeaFriday November 9, Panama CanalWe arose early (thankful for gaining an hour in the time change as we sailed West to Panama and Eastern Time) to watch the ship enter the 3 locks that took the ship up the 85 feet from sea level to the level of Gatun Lake. The canal has 6 sets of locks total but the ship just went up halfway and then back down again to the Caribbean. We left the ship in Gatun Lake for a 7 hour adventure across Panama by bus to a ferry on which we rode out the 3 remaining locks to the Pacific ocean. Being in the lock in a small boat is a different perspective from the big cruise ship. The canal seemed surprisingly small to me. We saw where they are starting the new expanded canal, which will allow the canal to carry larger ships. I was also surprised at the Gaillard Cut how small the cut looked. It is hard to believe that 20,000 people died in the French effort at this spot alone (of the 22,000 deaths). The area around the canal looks more pastoral than jungle these days. We had rain on our trip, which is not that surprising in an area that gets 250 inches of rain a year. We had a good local guide whose English we usually able to make out. Although when he said we were moving towards our “destiny” (when he meant “destination”) that sounded pretty ominous.Saturday November 10, Costa RicaWe had another early start (and to our surprise another time change to Central Time) in Costa Rica. Both at Panama and Costa Rica large numbers of passengers were doing shore excursions so we were gathered in the Frans Hals lounge (the largest theatre) where we were each tagged with a colored number sticker by tour group. With the rest of the red #7s we boarded a bus with a very articulate local guide. We transferred from the bus to a train for a ride through the rain forest and banana plantations. Living up to the name rain forest, it rained our entire day in Costa Rica. At times it rained quite hard. Our guide told us that the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica has two seasons: the rainy season and the rainier season. Some of our bus/train/ship mates still grumbled about the rain. We stopped at a banana packing plant but for some reason they were not working that day. They normally work every day and our guides were caught by surprise. Our bus driver works at one of these plants and is part of a program where he trained to be a driver and drives a couple of days a week. We learned that a banana plant will bear one and only one bunch of bananas (in about a year) and then will be chopped down. So they leave two younger plants growing from the same root system so that the same root system can bear 3 bunches of bananas in a year.After our train ride we stopped for a break with music, shopping, fresh fruit and fruit juice or beer (Imperial from Costa Rica) before boarding a boat where we cruised a short distance along the rain forest. We saw a sloth (curled in a ball against the rain) and several different types of birds: toucans, egrets, etc. We also saw small bats, which we would easily have missed if not for the sharp eyes of our boat driver.Sunday November 11, At SeaMonday November 12, At SeaI podcast about this trip at the Amateur Traveler podcast in these podcasts:Amateur Traveler Episode 113 – Theme Cruise to Panama (Shakespeare at Sea / MacMania)Amateur Traveler Video Episode 25 – Curaçao – Sailing and Snorkeling with the Bounty (part 1)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/7-inca-trail-tips/,7 Expert Tips to Help You Prepare for the Inca Trail,Peru,"The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is one that truly embodies the idea, “It’s the journey that matters”. While the lost city of Machu Picchu in Peru is breathtaking in itself, getting there the hard way has several hidden gems in store for the adventurous few.But owning the Inca Trail requires quite some effort! Here are 7 tips that will help you prepare for the road ahead.Have Your Facts StraightThe traditional or Classic Inca Trail begins in Cusco, passes through the Inca ruins of Llactapata, Runkurakay, Sayacmarca, Phuyupatamarca, and Wiñay Wayna, and finally terminates in Machu Picchu. The trek is 26 miles (43 km) long and takes you through 4 days and 3 nights of lush cloud-forests, subtropical jungle, beautiful valleys, and Inca ruins. On the majority of tours, you return to Cusco by train on the fourth day.The highest point on the Inca Trail is the Dead Woman’s Pass at 13,828 ft or 4,215 m, which is nearly 5,905 ft or 1,800 m higher than Machu Picchu. Along with steep ascents and descents, the trek comprises a number of passes and thousands of rocky steps.How to Prepare Physically for the Inca TrailOn the Classic Inca Trail, you’ll be averaging 7 miles (12 km) each day. The altitude and stone stairs add to the challenge, so undertaking this trek requires a basic level of fitness. This doesn’t mean you have to be an athlete, but once you’re sure you want to do this, it’s recommended to start getting physically fit for the trek.Start a training regime 3-6 months before your trek; keep the intensity light to moderate, but prolong the duration of workouts. Focus on aerobic activities like walking, running, cycling, and swimming to strengthen your cardiovascular system. Also, train your legs and upper body with lunges, lightweight squats, and step aerobics, and shoulder presses, sit-ups and back and shoulder flies.Note that mental stamina is going to be equally important for you to push through the trek. Prepare by challenging yourself to participate in and complete half marathons or triathlons that are organized in and around your city. A couple of mountain hikes – preferably with a weighted backpack – in your home country will give you an idea of what to expect on the Inca Trail.Inca Trail Map with ElevationMap from Cachi Inca Trail ToursDon’t Ignore Altitude SicknessAltitude sickness or acute mountain sickness is caused due to exposure to low levels of oxygen at altitudes of over 8,000 ft or 2,400 m above sea level. Symptoms manifest within hours of arrival at high altitudes and may include headache, shortness of breath, and nausea. Mild cases are usually self-treatable and resolve in 1-3 days, but some may be life-threatening.While altitude sickness can affect anyone irrespective of age, gender, or physical fitness levels, individuals with sleep apnea and heart or lung problems are at a higher risk for feeling its effects. So be sure to check with your doctor before you consider taking this trip of a lifetime.Give Yourself Time to AcclimatizeCusco itself is 11,152 ft or 3,399 m above sea level. So if you’re taking a flight to Cusco from a lower elevation, you’re bound to feel altitude sickness. You might want to consider taking a 21-hour bus ride from Lima instead, so you get to ascend slowly. But avoid this option if you’re prone to motion sickness.Either way, just give yourself enough time to acclimatize before your trek, and you’ll be fine. Spend a minimum of two days in Cusco before you begin your trek. Refrain from going on long walks or exerting yourself during this time. Stay hydrated, eat light meals, avoid alcohol, relax, and keep taking deep breaths.inca trail"" data-gyg-q=""inca trail"" data-gyg-widget=""activites"" data-gyg-href=""https://widget.getyourguide.com/PAKTIGU/activities.frame"">Proper Footwear for the Inca TrailHiking boots offer a greater degree of ankle support than other types of hiking footwear, and you’re going to need all the support you can get on the rugged Inca Trail. If you already have a good pair of hiking shoes, you can invest in ankle supports that can be secured with laces and/or Velcro. Check out your local drugstore well before your trip.When buying new shoes, ensure to get the perfect fit- footwear should neither squish your feet nor be too loose. Bear in mind that feet swell during the day, so head out to purchase shoes in the evening.Most importantly, new shoes can make your trek extremely uncomfortable. So break in your footwear well by wearing them around the block, around town, and on practice hikes.Pack LightDepending on your trek organizer, you will likely be trekking in a group, accompanied by guides, chefs and porters. These porters carry camping equipment and personal belongings of each trekker in the group. As such, you only need to carry a backpack with you that holds drinking water, your camera, and some essentials.Since porters can carry limited weight for each trekker, make sure you don’t exceed the limit. If you have to carry your own bags, here’s a list of things you’ll need on the trek.Inca Trail Packing ListSleeping bagSleeping matThermalsLayers in quick-drying fabricsWaterproof jacket and pantsUnderwear and socksTrekking footwearInsolesHandwash and sanitizerToothbrush and toothpaste or mouthwashSunscreenMoisturizerLip balmInsect repellentMedicines and bandagesToilet paperWet wipesSunglassesEarplugsHat or capKnee and ankle supportWalking polesTorchCamera and batteriesNotebook/journal and penSnacksWater bottleLastly,Book in AdvanceThe Inca Trail is one of the world’s most famous trekking routes owing to its splendid views of the Andes mountain range and glorious Incan ruins. Due to concerns about overuse that could lead to erosion, the Peruvian government has placed a limit on the number of hikers on this trail.Since only 500 people are allowed on the Inca Trail each day – only 200 of them being trekkers, and the rest guides and porters – peak season books out quickly. Bookings are managed officially and you might have to book your spot up to 6 months in advance.If this has got you all pumped up, don’t wait any longer. Go on and explore the magnificence of the Inca empire the right way. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/why-lake-titicaca-was-better-than-machu-picchu/,Why Lake Titicaca Was Better than  Machu Picchu,Peru,"Recently a friend asked me to review an itinerary he was putting together for a visit to Peru.  Since I had traveled there last summer with my daughters, he was interested in which destinations I thought were worth the time, money, and effort.  Eventually, he asked what was my favorite part of my journey. Lake TiticacaWithout hesitation, I replied that it was eating lunch on a terrace at a farmhouse on Taquile Island in the middle of Lake Titicaca.  He was shocked, of course, in his mind, my favorite part of the trip should have been when my eyes first gazed upon the beauty and majesty of Machu Picchu.  But this was not my first choice.  In fact, it was not even my second choice.  He wanted to know why and he wanted an explanation.  Many people feel that the Altiplano, Puno, and Lake Titicaca are areas of Peru that can easily be passed by.  I would disagree with this assumption.  I have many fond memories from this region and I felt in many ways that it was here where my daughters and I really came to know and love Peru.  Lake Titicaca is one of those places I learned about in elementary school.  My fellow fifth graders and I loved to giggle every time we had the opportunity to pronounce the name in class.  Most people know Lake Titicaca as the highest navigable lake in the world (for commercial craft), and many people know about the culture of the Uru people who base their sustenance on using the totora reed for everything from food to shelter. The lake and the island people are fascinating pieces of culture and geography, and we definitely enjoyed visiting the floating islands of Urus and talking to the local families.  We also realized that this aspect of visiting Lake Titicaca has become very touristy and is as much about selling souvenirs as it is about sharing culture.  Had this been all we experienced, I may have formed a different opinion about the lake.Island of TaquileThe second part of our excursion on Lake Titicaca included a boat ride to the hilly, rocky island of Taquile about 45 kilometers east of Puno.  This rugged and remote island featured some pre-Inca ruins mixed in among agricultural terraces.  There were no vehicles or hotels on the island and only a few small stores that sold basic necessities.  Families offer home stays, but only about 40,000 tourists visit the island each year.  Life for most of the residents has remained unchanged by much of our modern world.Our boat ride to the island was bumpy, but it was a sunny day and we enjoyed being on the lake.  When we arrived at Taquile, our boat docked at a secluded alcove.  Unlike, Urus, there was no one around to greet us or sell us souvenirs.  In fact, the island looked deserted.  As we stepped off the boat, we found a very serene, peaceful terrain devoid of tourists and other visitors.  It was not what we expected.  Our tour included a hike from one side of the island to the other.  The hike was not long, but it necessitated that we climb up one side of the island and walk down steep stairways and paths on the other.  The climb was relatively easy, but since the elevation of the lake is 12,500 feet above sea level, none of us were sprinting up the hills.   We took our time to enjoy hiking the narrow pathways through small farms and grazing pastures for sheep.  The local people allow the sheep to graze everywhere so their dropping fertilize the land.  They do this for a few years and then move the sheep to other parts of the island.  We quickly learned that it was a waste of time to worry about where we were stepping, nowhere was safe.Eventually, we reached a farmhouse terrace that overlooked the lake.  It was a simple structure made of stone; comfortable, but not too fancy.  The family which ran the farmhouse had prepared a picnic lunch for us.   What they offered us was a little bit of comfort; simple, but delicious local food; and unending views of the snow-capped mountains of Bolivia.  The day was warm, the wind was light, and there was nothing to do but eat, share stories, and gaze at the scenery that seemed to go on forever.  It was a perfect, serene, and peaceful afternoon. I have never been to Greece nor the Western Mediterranean, but I imagined that this must have been what it would be like dining on a terrace overlooking the Aegean Sea.  After eating lunch, enjoying the company of our new friends, talking with the local farm family, and relaxing for a while; we eventually hiked to the top of the island and then made our way back to our boat on the other side.  The hike, scenery, and serenity were exhilarating.  It was so unexpected.I realized at the time that this was a special moment that I would never forget.  I also began to realize that this is why I travel.  Our trip to Peru was a schedule of visits to destinations, but really what we were hoping for was the opportunity to have experiences such as the opportunity to meet people, see things we have never seen before, come face-to-face with history, and experience other cultures.  On Taquile, we had a travel moment that permanently left an impression on our souls.  LimaYou might be wondering, what was my second favorite experience?  It was eating dinner with my two daughters at a restaurant in Lima that was perched on an outside terrace on the side of a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.  To say it was anything less than magical would be an understatement.  I don’t want to downplay seeing Machu Picchu, it was definitely third on my list of favorite things.  But on Taquile Island, I truly experienced the beauty of Peru, and I came to realize the reason I love to travel.    Share this: "

The journey and the site are experiences we will always fondly treasure. There are really no new words of praise that I could write that would add much to the growing list of many who have made this journey before me.But one unique contribution I can add is to suggest that when you do make the decision to take this journey, there are many choices you will have to make. Planning a trip to Machu Picchu, researching your options, choosing wisely, and making plans can greatly enhance your experience and elevate your trip to the status of legendary. The following is a shortlist of questions you should consider before you finalize your Machu Picchu plans.What level of comfort will make your journey most enjoyable?Most tour companies book group tours at 3-star hotels. We upgraded our hotels to 4-star hotels anticipating that we might need a higher level of comfort and more quality food choices for breakfast. This proved to be a good decision. The altitude of the Andes Mountains affected us more than we anticipated. It never stopped us from doing anything, but it was always a minor discomfort that affected our trip. We didn’t find ourselves gasping for breath or reaching for oxygen tanks, but we did experience headaches, lightheadedness, and more fatigue than we anticipated.The biggest problem we experienced occurred when trying to sleep. Often we found ourselves breathing heavily and waking up at odd hours. After 7 days in the high altitude, we never fully adjusted to the climate. Comfortable hotels helped to ease the adjustment and make it less of a problem. Being careful about what we ate and taking advantage of good breakfasts definitely reduced time lost to sickness.Best time to visit Machu Picchu?The rainy season in Peru is from November to March which is also the warmest weather. The heaviest rain is usually in February. The site is busier from June until August. Like so many places if you can schedule a visit in shoulder season you will have a better and cheaper experience.How long should you stay in Cusco?Cusco is the closest airport to Machu Picchu so most travelers will pass through Cusco.How many days to spend in Cusco is a common question from travelers. We booked two days in Cusco before our trip to Machu Picchu, one night at Aguas Calientes (near Machu Picchu), and then two days in Cusco after Machu Picchu. This combination seemed to work well and if we had more time, we would have spent another day in Cusco. Cusco is just a fun place from which to stage your journey to the Sacred Valley and Machu Picchu. There is also a lot of history and culture to be experienced in Cusco. After visiting Machu Picchu, we were thankful that we were returning to Cusco, and we compiled a list of things we missed on our first visit. We didn’t get to see everything on our list, but we were glad that we had two extra days to see many of them.Related stories:Why You Should Explore the Ruins Around Cusco FirstThe Choco Museo: A Place to Make Chocolate Where Cacao GrowsHow to get to Machu Picchu?Should you travel to Machu Picchu from Cusco or the Sacred Valley?On the day you go to Machu Picchu you will travel there by Peru Rail. We stayed in Cusco and thought we would take the train from Cusco to Machu Picchu. Much to our surprise, we began our day with an hour and a half drive from Cusco to the Sacred Valley. This was tough because we had just taken this drive in the opposite direction the night before touring the Sacred Valley.We spent three hours needlessly driving through the mountains near the Sacred Valley. Rethinking our itinerary, it would have been best to spend the night before we left for Machu Picchu in the Sacred Valley near the train station at Ollaytaytambo. If we had done this, we would have been able to retire early and get a long rest before departing early in the morning for Machu Picchu. We just assumed our travel company would make a good decision for us. In retrospect, we should have made this decision.Which train station should you depart from to Machu Picchu?Which station you leave from should depend on where you stayed the night before. Most people depart for Machu Picchu from either Poroy Station near Cusco or Ollantaytambo Station in the Sacred Valley. The train ride from Poroy to Machu Picchu is a little over three hours. The journey from Ollantaytambo Station to Machu Picchu is roughly half that time. But there are other considerations. The full train fare from Poroy costs much more than the fare from Ollantaytambo. If you have 3 to 4 people in your party it may be much less expensive to take a transfer from Cusco and then pay the lower train fare for the shorter ride from Ollaytaytambo. This is what our tour company did for our trip, even though we thought we thought we had paid to leave from Poroy.I genuinely enjoyed the train ride and would have preferred to leave from Poroy, especially since we were staying in Cusco. I would have also preferred to return to Poroy on the way back from Machu Picchu. Unfortunately, our tour agent made this choice for us. We had a late train departure from Aguas Calientes to Ollaytaytambo. Our return transfer back to Cusco late at night after a long day at Machu Picchu was exhausting. The only consolation was the spectacular view we had of the night time stars and the Milky Way. Remembering that this was the same night sky the Incas viewed made the trip a little more bearable.How many days should you spend at Machu Picchu?I once read from another travel writer that the average tourist spends multiple travel days getting to Machu Picchu, but only spends an average of 3 to 4 hours at the site. His recommendation was to stay overnight and spend two days at Machu Picchu. We took this advice and would recommend it to everyone. You can see Machu Picchu in 3 to 4 hours, but you need at least two visits to fully appreciate it and experience the many things there are to do at the site. We stayed at a very nice hotel in Aquas Calientes at the base of Machu Picchu, and we genuinely enjoyed the town. It is a quirky tourist town that caters to both backpackers and luxury travelers. The town sits dramatically along raging mountain streams at the base of Machu Picchu. The Peru Rail train tracks run down the main street through the middle of town. There are tourist stalls everywhere and many restaurants and bars. It was a crazy contrast to the serenity of Machu Picchu, but also a lot of fun.What should you schedule to do at Machu Picchu?Machu Picchu takes time to fully appreciate. We started our first day by taking a 2-hour guided tour with a personal guide. It was well worth the time and cost. For lunch, we ate at the Sanctuary Lodge. It was expensive, but the food was good and the respite was refreshing. Afterward, we hiked some of the pathways around Machu Picchu. Eventually, it rained and we had to head down the mountain. Unfortunately, we had to wait a full hour in line to get the bus down the mountain from Machu Picchu. Ironically even though it was raining heavily at Machu Picchu, it was not raining down in the valley a few miles away at Aquas Calientes.Huayna PicchuFor our second day, we had secured a permit many months ahead of time to hike to the top of Huayna Picchu. There are only 400 precious permits issued each day to climb to the top of this picturesque mountain. Two hundred for the 7 AM hike and two hundred for the 10 AM entrance time. The climb is strenuous and not for everyone. If you choose to hike, prepare yourself for a 60 to 90-minute hike up steep, uneven stairs carved into the side of a mountain. It is a tough climb in high altitude. If you do make it to the top, you will be rewarded with tremendous views. But this is not the only hiking opportunity at Machu Picchu. Similar views can also be found by hiking to the top of Machu Picchu mountain, as well as the Inca Road to the Sun Gate. There is even a hike you can take to see an old Inca Bridge. Needless to say, there are many things to see and do at Machu Picchu. You will need much more than a 3 to 4-hour visit to fully appreciate the site.Machu Picchu MapMachu Picchu Map from Cachi Machu Picchu Tour providerShould you hike the Inca Trail?Many adventure travelers book two or five-day hikes along the Inca Trail in order to get to Machu Picchu. I can only imagine that this is an incredible experience and the true way to see Machu Picchu. There are limited hiking permits available to hike the trail. Also, much preparation is needed to be ready for the journey. I would suggest you research your options well ahead of time. You can book excursions when you are in Cusco, but it is well worth thinking through this option and making plans before you arrive in Peru.The goal of most backpackers who hike the Inca Trail is to enter Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate and then hike down into Machu Picchu. Most people do not choose this option because of time, cost, physical limitations, or simply because backpacking is not their thing. But, you can still experience the Inca Trail by reverse hiking from Machu Picchu back up to the Sun Gate. It is a two-hour round trip hike that is not quite as dramatic as the traditional entrance through the Sun Gate, but it is still a reasonable alternative that almost anyone can do.Inca Trail Map with ElevationMap from Cachi Inca Trail Tours Related stories:Travel to Peru (podcast)Could Marcahuamachuco, Peru Really Rival Machu Picchu?Why Lake Titicaca Was Better than Machu PicchuMachu Picchu is the goal, but not the only Inca site around Cusco. It is a good idea to prepare yourself by seeing smaller Inca sites near Cusco and in the Sacred Valley. We visited Sacsahuanan, Pisac, and Ollaytaytambo. These are significant Inca sites that show the building capabilities of the Incas and gave us a good context with which to further appreciate the mastery of Machu Picchu. There are also additional sites worth considering such as the agricultural terraces at Moray and the Salt Works at Maras. After Machu Picchu, we opted to continue our travel overland across the Altiplano to Lake Titicaca. Along the way, there were smaller Inca sites that provided a good post transition from Machu Picchu. All of these helped us to fully appreciate the uniqueness of this area of Peru and the ancient people who helped to establish its identity.Should you enhance your experience by visiting other Inca sites?Machu Picchu is the goal, but not the only Inca site around Cusco. It is a good idea to prepare yourself by seeing smaller Inca sites near Cusco and in the Sacred Valley. We visited Sacsahuanan, Pisac, and Ollaytaytambo. These are significant Inca sites that show the building capabilities of the Incas and gave us a good context with which to further appreciate the mastery of Machu Picchu.Where to Stay near Machu PicchuBooking.com    (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');ConclusionAll of these questions I listed require you to pre-plan and make decisions before you get to Peru. It is by no means a complete list, but it is a good place to start. Most people who book through a tour agent simply do not realize that they have many different options. Many of the choices I listed will not significantly raise the cost of your trip, but they may have a major impact on your overall experience.There are no wrong choices, but since most visitors will have limited time and money to visit Machu Picchu, it is worth doing some research and deciding upon a plan that will provide you with a full and enriching journey. Since your trip to Cusco and Machu Picchu may be a once in a lifetime opportunity, it should be a collection of experiences you want to have, rather than choices made for you by a tour agentShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/choco-museo-cusco/,"Choco Museo – Cusco, Peru – A Place to Make Chocolate Where Cacao Grows",Peru,"Choco MuseoFor those of you who get easily bored with museums, there is a new experience throughout Latin America made just for you.  It’s called the Choco Museo; a museum dedicated to making chocolate in countries where cacao grows.  It’s a place where you can learn about the history of cacao and chocolate as well as taste, buy, and even make your own chocolate.Recently on a trip to Cusco, Peru, my daughters and I learned about this museum and immediately decided we had to check it out.  The museum is small on exhibits but big on experience.  They do have multiple rooms that present interesting displays and videos on cacao production and history of chocolate.  In addition, they also provide samples and sell their own artisanal chocolates, but the real draw of this museum are the chocolate making workshops.  You can choose offerings such as “From the Cacao Bean to the Chocolate Bar” and “Make Your Own Truffles” in either English, Spanish, or occasionally other languages.  We were immediately drawn to the idea of making our own chocolate from scratch and stopped in to make a reservation.  Much to our disappointment, all the classes had a limited capacity and were full during our brief stay in Cusco.  We tried every trick in the book to get into a class but ultimately were not successful.Our travel plans included a long layover in Lima a few days in the future so we went online and booked the two-hour “Bean to Bar” class at the Miraflores location in Lima, Peru. The highlights of the workshop promised that we would learn about the origins of chocolate, prepare three chocolate drinks starting with cacao beans, and make our own handmade chocolates with our own choice of fillings.  Secretly I felt I had an advantage over the other participants.  I live near Hershey, Pennsylvania, and have visited the Chocolate World exhibit at least 30 times (admittedly for the free chocolate samples handed out at the end).  I practically have the entire attraction memorized.  In fact, I am old enough to have taken a tour inside the actual chocolate factory in Hershey.  I didn’t tip my hand early, but I had a good idea of what to expect.We began the workshop with a short presentation on the history of chocolate supplemented with models, posters, and charts.  I was particularly impressed with the information on who produces cacao beans and who consumes the most chocolate.  As Americans, we’re not even close to the top.  We also had a good explanation of the different types of beans, and we got to taste and break them apart.   I was also pleased that we did not spend too much time on this.  Truthfully everyone wanted to make chocolate.Our instructor, Raul, was both informative and entertaining.  He began the class with everyone selecting beans and taking turns roasting them.  Soon we were cracking and breaking the shells apart and separating out the nibs, the actual seed inside the shell.  Each of us ground our own nibs using a primitive mortar and pestle to a smooth cocoa paste called chocolate liquor.  I learned it was called this because the combination of cocoa butter and cocoa paste creates the chocolate flavor.  After this, it was time to make some chocolate drinks.  One of the first uses of chocolate by the Mayans and Aztecs was to make flavored drinks.  We made a chocolate tea that smelled delightful and had a pleasant light, chocolate taste.  Next, we made a Mayan hot chocolate drink flavored with honey and dried chilis that had a much stronger chocolate flavor.  Finally, the chocolate workshop kicked into full gear when we made a European milk chocolate holiday drink that had an intense chocolate flavor.  All of these were made using our ground chocolate paste.  By the third drink, we were wired and ready to make some serious chocolate bars.The chocolate for making bars was already prepared for us due to the long conching process needed to make smooth, edible chocolate.  We had a detailed explanation between the differences between dark, milk, and white chocolate, and we were allowed to work with our own preferred flavor.  We had the choice of many different chocolate molds and a large variety of traditional and unusual toppings such as coca leaves, chilis, and Peruvian mountain salt.  All of this was supplemented with a liberal amount of real chocolate liqueur sampling and more chocolate tasting.   After we were finished, the staff at the museum cooled our chocolates and helped us to wrap them up in decorative bags to take home.This was a fun workshop from start to finish.  The Choco Museo workshops are an experience that will delight both adults and children and the cost (about $25 US dollars) was reasonable considering the time and materials we used.  They have facilities in Lima (Barranco and Miraflores), Cusco, and Ollantaytambo in Peru; Antigua in Guatemala; Granada in Nicaragua; and Punta Cana and Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.  Some of the facilities even offer multiple day tours to chocolate plantations.  So if you are traveling in Latin America and need a break from sightseeing, check out the Choco Museo.   Really, it’s all about making and eating your own chocolate, what’s not to like about that? Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-faces-tradition-alverez-franquemont-coca/,"Book Review: “Faces of Tradition” by Alverez, Franquemont and Coca",Peru,"“Faces of Tradition, Weaving Elders of the Andes” is a book that could be considered the equivalent of a church directory or an annual of the pillars of the community.  The cover of this coffee table book is an entrancing photo of an Andean weaver.  Her gaze snatched my attention and a sense of calm encompassed my soul while looking at her weather worn, possibly smiling face.  She looked like she could provide wisdom in a sentence and an education while weaving together.  I was hooked and wanted to view more figures!The idea for this book was a result of a gathering of weavers at the Center for Traditional Textiles of Cusco (CTTC).  Afterwards, three friends who attended the soirée chose to produce the book, in honor of the Elders with their portraits after the discussion that one would remember the Elders faces the most.  After tenderly turning each page like an Alice Paul suffragist scrapbook, one discovered a helpful map of the small community in the Andes Mountains denoting each of the nine villages involved with the CTTC where the Elders, who have earned their titles by living properly, dwell.  At the closing of the book is a glossary of Quechua (the language of the region) terms pertaining to designs, animals, food, festivals and weaves.  The pages in between are richly and respectably written to honor the Elders who have learned their passed down craft for survival and enjoyment.Each chapter contained nuggets of information about gender roles or the impact of land reform and customs.  They also identified Elders from the community with a portrait and a brief biography of their life describing their hardships and the influence of textiles in their lives.  Their faces usually lacked expressions under their sun protecting hats, ranging from a dusty brown to a yellow bread basket looking hat called monteras.  Their shoulders contained a woven shawl designed with their traditional weave and design.  A large silver pin held together their shawl and occasionally, tucked into their belt was a dowel with yarn for spinning while walking or herding livestock.  The book described the tweaked designs, colors or added letters and numbers of each village incorporated into their textiles.  Most of the Elders are women and most are widowed.  All have hard life stories, though each textile was made for a specific reason-a wedding, one of the dwindling elaborate festivals, warmth or trade.This book is a lovely tribute to the Elders who have taught and shown what was once a dying art and tradition to their family and community.  The CTTC has been instrumental in supporting preservation and the continuation of that heritage for the community.  I do recommend to gently pick up this book with museum quality archiving gloves (because the images are that beautiful), crawl under your patchwork quilt or afghan your Grandmother passed onto you and learn about the superstitions, techniques and the persistence of these Elders who lived and worked yesteryear and today without modern technology.Disclosure:  A free copy of this book was given to a volunteer with the expectation that a fair and honest review would be written for it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/how-to-spend-48-hours-in-lima-peru/,"How to Spend 48 Hours In Lima, Peru",Peru,"As with many capital cities, Lima can be an overwhelming, confusing and intimidating metropolis. As the transport hub of Peru, it is a city that is all but impossible to avoid, and many travelers are confronted with the choice of either skipping Lima’s barely organized chaos and getting out of town as fast as possible, or spend some time trying to penetrate the sprawling capital.Lima’s Plaza Mayor – Matthew BarkerThe answer is simple: don’t skip Lima. Peru’s culture, government, history, and legendary gastronomy all come together in the city that lines the bluffs along the Pacific Ocean. You could spend years exploring Lima’s crevices, but here’s how to do it in 48 hours.Parque KennedyIf your flight has arrived on Friday night, the long cab right from the airport has probably left you feeling exhausted, but curious. Grab a hotel in Miraflores. There are all different price ranges in the area, but the closer you are to Parque Kennedy, the more lively the local.Drop your things and hunt down a low-key dinner. Around Calle de las Pizzas on Parque Kennedy does not serve up the greatest dishes, but it is a good place for a quick and easy bite and some fabulous people-watching. Try Peru’s famous pisco sour, a brandy made from grapes. Careful though- it sneaks up on you quickly and just two can leave you wobbling as you stand up. If you’re a party animal, explore the lively (albeit overpriced) bars. If not, you’re not missing much- get some sleep for the next day.Saturday morning begins early for adventure junkies. The coastline along Lima is renowned for its surf. Head down to the beach for a lesson at around 6 AM – don’t forget to rent a wetsuit! Even if surfing isn’t for you, watching the locals shred the waves before work is a sight in itself. Get back to your hotel for breakfast and a quick shower before the busy day begins.BarrancoFrom your hotel in Miraflores grab a cab to Barranco, and ask to be let out at the Bajada de Baños. Barranco is Lima’s Bohemian arts district and is home to decadent homes that are enough to make anyone want to buy one of those fixer-uppers. The Bajada is a small walkway that leads down to the ocean. With restaurants and homes built into the cut-out cliffs, the architectural beauty of the walk will astound you.Barranco back streets, Lima – Matthew BarkerHead all the way down and cross the pedestrian bridge for another glimpse of the beach. If your appetite is up, stop by one of the restaurants for a snack. Otherwise, continue onto the main square in Barranco for a better close-up of the old homes that coat the sidewalks.After taking in Barranco, take a cab to Museo Larco. The museum is housed in an 18th Century museum, and is one of the largest private collections of Peruvian artifacts from a wide span of cultures.  However, the museum is perhaps better known for its interesting collection of erotic artifacts- housed in a separate building in case you want to keep your trip family-friendly.Plaza MayorFollowing Museo Larco, take one more ride over to Plaza Mayor. Plaza Mayor is Lima’s true downtown and home to its government buildings. The detailed architecture is stunning, but the best history lies in the Convento de San Francisco. A still-running monastery, it is also the home to the Catacombs that house 25,000 skeletons dating back over three hundred years. English tours are available and provide ample time to view the neatly piled bones below. Another highlight is Peruvian artist Diego de la Puentes’ take on the Last Supper- complete with cuy (guinea pig) as the central plate.Convento de San Francisco, Lima – Matthew BarkerHead back to Miraflores to change for dinner. Lima’s gastronomy is unparalleled and it is difficult to go wrong. Many Peruvians will point you in the direction of restaurants owned by one of their most famous chefs: Gaston Acurio. Panchita and Astrid y Gaston are two favorites.  If you can move after one of his meals, head back to Barranco to check out what is known as Lima’s best of nightlife.Sunday MorningOn Sunday morning you might need to take it slow, so walk down to Larcomar to explore the shopping center that seems precariously built into the bluffs. Take a walk down the Malecón, a path leading along the hills above the coast, to the Parque del Amor. See the unique statue, but also to ask about parasailing. Though the trip is short, the expansive view of Lima and the ocean are well worth it. Grab lunch in Larcomar before heading in a taxi to the Museo de la Nación for a comprehensive overview of Peru’s history and culture.Following the museum, head over to the Circuito Mágico del Agua. This new park opens at dusk and provides a stunning collection of fountains that light up, dance and create a million ways to play. If it is warm, enjoy playing in the water, but cooler nights are just as enthralling. Though you may not want to leave, head back to Parque Kennedy to see if any artisans have set up shop. After a long day, dinner is warranted. Brujas de Cachiche is another favorite, but it is hard to go wrong in Lima.  After dinner, get your rest. This was only the 48 hours of your trip.Lima is not to be missed. Often capital cities hide their beauty, but knowing where to look will provide a stunning overview of Peru for everything it is: culture, art, food, adventure, and wonderful people.This article was written for Tucan Travel, specialists in adventure group and guided tours of Peru. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/could-marcahuamachuco-peru-really-rival-machu-picchu/,"Could Marcahuamachuco, Peru Really Rival Machu Picchu?",Peru,"Although Marcahuamachuco has been around for about 1600 years, only recently has it started being promoted as an archaeological site that could one day rival Machu Picchu. The site is a pre-Incan one and there is still more unknown about it than known, despite the fact that it has been studied since 1900. The reasons for this include plundering of the artifacts that might have revealed some vital information, destruction through the ravages of time and nature and the fact that there is some of it that is yet to be uncovered.The site is huge, covering more than 590 acres or 240 hectares. Determining exactly how large the grounds are will need to wait until the excavation is completed. As with many of the major sites in Peru, it is located at a high altitude, over 12000 feet or 3700 meters above sea level.Although it has been studied for such a long time, it wasn’t until the government partnered with the Global Heritage Fund in 2010 to clear away more of the brush that the size of the site was appreciated and interest it was renewed.The name is Quechua and means “people of the men with hawklike headdresses”. Yet, exactly which culture the site belonged to is one of the things yet unknown. It’s considered a particularly important pre-Incan site given that the buildings, language, and gods are unlike any others in Peru. It is believed that the inhabitants were gone as of the 13th century before the Incas even arrived, yet it’s unknown where or why they went.Among the structures that remain, at least in part, are high walls, galleries, a plaza, living quarters, a religious center and burial sites. The hope is that those human remains that have not yet been destroyed will offer some clues about the inhabitants.Much work will need to be done to repair the site before it can truly become a tourist attraction to rival Machu Picchu. Adding to the challenge is the fact that there are local people living and grazing their animals within the complex itself. In its favor is that there are no other sites of this magnitude in northern Peru as well as that it is accessible by road. This will make it easier to reach than Machu Picchu, which requires hiking or travel by train, or Choquequirao, which can only be reached by a rather challenging trek.It’s possible to travel to the site by road from Trujillo, a journey of about three and a half hours. Trujillo is already the home base for visiting two other archaeological sites, Chan Chan and the Temples of the Sun and Moon.PodcastFor more information about traveling to Peru, listen to Travel to Peru – Amateur Traveler Episode 349.Willa (but not the Amateur Traveler) was sponsored by Tucan Travel, a Peru adventure trips specialist, to write this post.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/paucartambo-festival-a-traditional-spectacle/,Paucartambo Festival: A Traditional Spectacle – Peru,Peru,"Paucartambo is a small town a few hours from Cusco. It’s not well-traveled except for one time a year when people come from all over Peru and abroad for the festival of the Virgin of Carmen, held each July from the 15th to the 17th.Although the festival is ostensibly for the Virgin of Carmen, this was a later alteration imposed by the Spanish clergy. To Andean people the festival originally celebrated Pachamama, Mother Earth.For three days, the entire town puts aside daily life and celebrates as they have done since pre-colonial times. There are colorful costumes, a variety of masks and a great deal of traditional music and dances. The dancers rehearse for many long hours, just as their ancestors did before them. These dances represent the many stories of the country and its people.There are around 20 dance groups and they need to rehearse together for many weeks. One of these, the Cápaq Negro, represents African enslavement in the plantations and mines of Peru. The Cápaq Q’olla is a religious dance symbolizing merchants who brought their wares to Paucartambo. The Cápaq Chuncho are warriors who form the honor guard of the Virgin.Then there are the Maqtas which are like mischievous tricksters are running around everywhere. They make sure that hats are taken off when the Virgin is present and that the drinking stops for a brief moment. The dance is meant to symbolize the treatment of the indigenous peoples by the Spanish landowners.The list goes on and it’s impossible to not be impressed by the dedication, effort and artistic display of the participants. There is something to catch the eye everywhere you look and one can be thankful that the day of the digital camera is here. It would be impossible to capture it all on rolls of film. Speaking of photo opportunities, a side trip that many people make while they’re here is to go to see a spectacular sunrise at nearby Tres Cruces.To get here you have some more options than you would normally because it’s festival time. In addition to hiring your own private transport from Cusco which was around 200-250 soles this year, there are also many buses and mini-vans that wait to collect passengers. Buses cost about 20 soles to get there and 10 soles to get back. Mini-vans will cost a bit more.Bear in mind that accommodation here is very basic so you may want to bring a sleeping bag.This article was written for Peru Discover, specialists in customized Peru tours.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/machu-picchu-explore-cusco/,Heading to Machu Picchu? Why You Should Explore the Ruins Around Cusco First,Peru,"Travelers heading to Cusco, Peru are usually there for one main reason – to see the wonder that is Machu Picchu.  All travelers have their own way of seeing Machu Picchu.  Some take the train and stay in the small town of Aguas Calientes, taking a day or two to explore the famous ruins.  Some go hardcore, hiking the classic Inca Trail, taking the same route the Incas did hundreds of years ago. Still, others take alternative treks, reveling in the solitude of the Andes on their way to one of the world’s most famous sites.But before you jet off from Cusco for Machu Picchu, you may want to consider doing a little exploring in the areas surrounding Cusco first. There are plenty of Incan ruins around the city, and they are a fabulous precursor for the grand-daddy of them all.  You can make a nice day trip out of exploring these ruins by heading out of Cusco (you can do it on foot if you’d like) toward Sacsayhuaman, which overlooks the city and provides spectacular views.Why Visit the Ruins Around CuscoPart of a visit to Machu Picchu is understanding the history of the Incas. The entire Sacred Valley is littered with Incan ruins, all telling their own unique story about this fascinating society that was well ahead of its time. There are plenty of nice museums in and around Cusco that can educate travelers about the Incas and the architectural style that makes them so famous. But seeing some of these ruins in person, preferably with a guide, can give travelers even more information before making the trek to Machu Picchu.It’s fascinating learning about the history of the ruins and the people who built them. One of the most impressive parts of Incan architecture is the fact that everything is so well thought out. What the Incas did from an architectural standpoint is pretty extraordinary considering that these massive walls are still standing after 500+ years (with absolutely no mortar). Everything also has some type of symbolic meaning. Many of the altars and rock carvings within the ruins are done in threes – symbolic of the three worlds the Incans believed in. These three worlds were represented by three important animals – the snake, puma, and condor. Learning facts like these will open up a whole new world when visiting Machu Picchu, and travelers will see many similarities between the ruins around Cusco and the most famous of Incan sites.The RouteIt’s about a one-mile hike from the center of town (Plaza de Armas) to the first set of ruins at Sacsayhuaman, but be aware that one mile is straight up.  You can certainly take a cab if necessary.  From there it’s about 5 miles (8 kilometers) to the town of Pisac.  In between are three more sets of ruins – Qenqo, Puka Pukara, and Tambo Machay – and if you choose to hike it, keep in mind that the hike to the ruins is pretty much all uphill, which does make for a nice, relaxing hike back into town.Options for Visiting the RuinsYou already know that hiking is an option when visiting these ruins, and if you plan on hiking to Machu Picchu itself, then this is a great opportunity to get acclimated to the altitude.  There is no actual trail, only a road, but travelers hike this route daily so you won’t be alone, and everything is clearly marked and easy to find.If you don’t want to spend the entire day hiking, then you can take the bus to Pisac and see the ruins in reverse order, walking downhill most of the way. The cost for the bus is only a few dollars.If you don’t feel like messing with a bus, then grab a taxi from somewhere in town and take it up to the first set of ruins at Sacsayhuaman or the last ones at Tambo Machay and explore from there. Remember that taxis in Cusco don’t use meters, so agree on a price before departing. A cab all the way to Tambo Machay should cost anywhere from $6-$10US.If you can get yourself to Sacsayhuaman, either by foot or cab, you can then hire a horse and horseman to take you to the rest of the ruins. Cost shouldn’t be more than about $7US per person.There are plenty of tour operators in Cusco offering any type of tour imaginable, so keep your eye out around town for operators offering tours of the ruins around town. You can inquire in your hostel or hotel for more information or just start searching what the different tour operators have to offer.The price to get into the four ruins is about $15US/person. Make sure you hold onto your ticket as there is not a gate, but you could get asked for it at any time during your journey. If you begin at Sacsayhuaman, then you will no doubt be approached by locals offering their services as a guide. Some speak only Spanish, and some speak English as well. This is a great opportunity to learn even more about the ruins, and the guides will give you all types of useful information that will be helpful for your time at Machu Picchu.Visiting these ruins, particularly with a guide, is a great way to learn more about the Incas, their culture, religion, and society before seeing the most important Incan site of all, Machu Picchu. Most travelers stay in Cusco for a few days preparing for their journey, so you might as well make it worth your while. Exploring the ruins around Cusco, along with visiting the various museums in town, will have you pumped up and ready to see one of the most famous sites the world has to offer – Machu Picchu!Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/trekking-and-confronting-altitude-in-huaraz-peru/,"Trekking and Confronting Altitude in Huaraz, Peru",Peru,"I like to think I’m in fairly good shape. I exercise regularly and other than stove-top popcorn I’m pretty much a healthy eater. I wouldn’t call myself an avid trekker (because carrying a weighty backpack really ruins the scenery, in my opinion) but I do enjoy hiking, camping, and pretending I can rock climb. So I was pretty pumped to be traveling to Huaraz, Peru’s mecca for outdoor enthusiasts.The city of Huaraz sits over 10,100 feet above sea level. It is relevant to note that altitude sickness for weak lowlanders kicks in at about 8,000 feet. I’m from Ohio, a state that has an unimpressive altitude of 550 feet. I think you can guess how I dealt with the altitude (hint: not very well).The TownHuaraz is a surprisingly dingy place (most Peruvian cities are tidy affairs), but hidden in the grunge are some remarkable cafes catering to backpackers and hard-core mountain climbers. I slightly fell in love with Café Andino, the ultimate ex-pat hangout. They serve delicious breakfasts, smoothies, and burritos (which are difficult to find in Peru) all at a decent price. Plus they have an extensive library of books available to borrow. California Café, a few blocks away, is another gem.The MountainsSo what are these hip international-style hangouts doing in this dusty town? It’s all about the mountains. Huaraz is smack in the middle of the Cordillera Blanca and the Cordillera Negra, two massive mountain ranges that are part of the Andes. The Blanca range is about 12.5 miles wide and 112 miles long and has more than 30 peaks that top 18,400 feet. To put that in perspective, all of North America has only 3 peaks that tall (Mt. McKinley in Alaska, Mt. Logan in Canada, and Volcan Citlaltépetl in Mexico). This consolidation of sky-high peaks with base camps easily reached from town is what makes Huaraz so hip.But let’s get one thing straight:  I’m no mountain climber. I don’t “do” base camp. I don’t own crampons. The idea of carrying all my gear on my back as I forge through snow and ice and possible death doesn’t fit my definition of a good time. So for me, these mountains were simply a beautiful backdrop.However, I did venture out on one excursion. Laguna 69 is a long day hike (with a giggle-worth name) that starts at 12,465 feet and ascends to 15,090 feet—higher than the highest mountain in the continental USA.Hiking to Laguna 69The adventure to Laguna 69 requires hiring a taxi to drive you 3 hours to the trailhead, passing two twin turquoise lakes of Llanganuco (Chinancocha and Urconcocha) along the way. I paid 180 soles for round trip transportation, not a bad price if it is split among a few people. A guide isn’t necessary, because the trail is easy to follow, but be sure to have 5 soles for the one-day entrance fee for Huascarán National Park, where the lake is located.The first portion of the trail crosses a fairly flat valley. What should have been an easy stroll left me panting and light-headed after 15 minutes. The altitude and I were not friends. The bad news is that each step felt like I was pushing through an invisible wall of Jell-O. The good news is that because the easy part was so difficult, by the time I hit the incline I was almost immune to the agony. I staggered along like a drunken soldier—sloppy but determined—while other hikers zoomed past with their walking poles, trendy trekking gear, and an apparent abundance of oxygen.I preemptively celebrated summit victory at a tiny lake at the top of the first pass, only to discover it was not Laguna 69; I still had miles to go. This was a momentary mental setback, but 4 hours after stepping out of the taxi, I finally arrived at the sparking little lake surrounded by glaciers and icy peaks. Laguna 69 is pretty enough by itself, but I’m pretty sure the ridiculous effort required to reach its shores had something to do with its splendor.With fears I wouldn’t make it back before dark, I only spent about 40 minutes appreciating the magnificent beauty of Laguna 69—listening to cleaving glaciers and watching bits of ice tumble down—before beginning the speedier but still difficult decline back to base (it took me 2 and a half hours).Get ThereHuaraz is easily reached from Lima, Peru’s capital and the only city with an international airport. Frequent buses run between the two cities, and a one-way journey takes about 8 hours. Expect some spectacular scenery and a lot of windy roads. I recommend the bus companies Movil Tours and Cruz del Sur for their safety records and fairly comfortable reclining seats. For the best views, book tickets in the first row of the second level. If you get motion sickness, stick to the first level.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/a-guide-to-the-museums-of-lima-peru/,"A Guide to the Museums of Lima, Peru",Peru,"Few tourists spend much time in Lima which is a real shame, especially for those interested in learning more about Peru’s long and fascinating history and culture.Lima is home to Peru’s best museums, showcasing the city and country’s history from across the ages.Plaza San Martin, Lima’s colonial center – Matthew BarkerMuseo de la Nación and Museo Nacional de Antropología y Arqueología are highly recommended. Although the first is home to many pre-Colombian artefacts, they are somewhat disorganised and very little interpretation is on offer.  However, its temporary exhibits are usually very worthwhile.  It also hosts regular evening events, ranging from movie showings to talks about Peruvian culture.Situated on Avenida Javier Prado Este, the easiest and safest way to get here is by taxi.  A taxi from Javier Prado Metropolitano station will cost less than five soles.On the other hand, Museo Nacional de Antropología y Arqueología has several well-organised displays of ceramics from a number of Peruvian civilizations.  Situated on Plaza Bolívar in Pueblo Libre, either take a ‘S’ combi from Miraflores or taxi.Museo de Oro in the Larcomar shopping centre has a vast display of gold objects, jewellery and adornments from pre-Inca Peru.  Headsets allow you to hear commentary in numerous different languages and in addition there is written interpretation in both Spanish and English.  Larcomar can be easily reached by micro heading to Barranco, by taxi or on foot from central Miraflores.Art lovers on the other hand should head to Barranco – the bohemian district of Lima.  There are many galleries, mainly small and supporting new artists.  80M2 Arte y Debates comes highly recommended by local artists who claim it offers ‘arte fresco’ – new styles of art and thought. Located on Calle Prolongación San Martín, it can be easily reached on foot from the main square in Barranco.Also situated in Barranco is Amelia Pinzas, Calle Cajamarca 202 which supports younger artists; Wu Ediciones, Saenz Peña 129 featuring local folk and fine art; and Dedalo, Saenz Peña 295 which hosts numerous different types of art. For more art galleries visit the district of San Isidro.Note that most museums and galleries across Peru are closed on Mondays and although many museums offer personal guide services, they are usually only available in Spanish.  National museum day is held annually on the 18th May. Although this means that entrance is free to museums across the country, queues can be extremely long, so it is advisable to avoid visiting museums on this day.This article was written for Vaya Adventures, specialists in tours across Latin America including combined Machu Picchu and Galapagos tours.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/chicha-the-infamous-saliva-fermented-beer-from-peru/,Chicha: The Infamous Saliva-Fermented Beer From Peru,Peru,"There are two foods that are ubiquitous across the Peruvian Andes. One is potatoes and the other is corn. This isn’t the corn we’re used to back home. Peruvian corn, choclo, comes in kernels many times the size of our small, sweet version. They’re big, fat, juicy and versatile. Many things can be made from choclo but the most infamous has to be the corn-based beer, chicha.Sharing a glass of chicha in the mountains of Cusco, Peru – Matthew BarkerAlthough it isn’t especially alcoholic the amount that is consumed at one sitting can be enormous and in the towns and villages of the Andes, getting drunk on chichi is a popular pastime – particularly during on of the many holidays. On these days drinking starts early and most folks are more than a bit tipsy by the afternoon.The word chicha isn’t the original Quechua name for the drink, but is the name applied by the Spanish following their conquest of the Andes. Some say that the word is derived from indigenous languages used in Panama and Colombia or in Mexico. Others say it comes from chichal, to spit. Which, as it turns out, is particularly apt.As is common in other parts of the world, Andean people realized they could use saliva to activate the fermentation process, making the partial chewing & spitting out of corn kernels the first step in the chicha brewing process.Like civilizations before and after, the indigenous Andean people placed great significance on their beer and the brewing process became a ritual carried out by a small group of women, known as Virgins of the Sun, of the king’s chosen women. The corn would be chewed, mixed with saliva in the mouth and then spat out and stored for fermentation.The chewing & spitting part of the process was removed over time, and now malted barley is used, as is common in most beer brewing processes. That said, the old techniques doubtless live on in the more remote and rural corners of the mountains.The popularity of chicha definitely lives on. There is a town called Chinchero that lies between Cusco and Urubamba in the Sacred Valley. Today, although this town is known for its weavings, the town square features a giant statue of a man in traditional dress that looks for all the world like he is tipping back a jug of the homebrew.Throughout the Cusco area, but especially in the countryside, you can spot many chicherias around, recognizable by the red flag or bag hanging on a pole outside. Even modern, non-spit produced chicha is only recommended for the most hardened of stomachs. Chances are the brew will have been stored in less than sanitary conditions for a while, and the cloudy liquid has an earthy taste that isn’t naturally palatable to Western tongues.The tell-tale red flag of a chicheria – Matthew BarkerThat said, if you’re brave and don’t mind a day or two of “digestive discomfort,” entering the unlit gloom of an abobe-walled chicheria, sipping from a beaker of chicha while practicing your Quechua with your new companions, all makes for a genuine cultural experience.This article was written for Aracari, a specialist in luxury Peru travel.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/ollantaytambo-peru/,Ollantaytambo Peru – Quiet Corner of the Sacred Valley,Peru,"Ollantaytambo Peru is a small town with a long name and an even longer list of hidden treasures awaiting the visitor who wishes to take a break on the crowded route to Machu Picchu.The ancient town, continuously inhabited since the 13th century, lies in a secluded corner of the Sacred Valley, two hours from Cuzco by car and an hour’s train ride from Machu Picchu. It is a walker’s paradise offering little-known ruins in beautiful surroundings and a great spot to enjoy tranquil evenings after the tour buses are long gone.Ollantaytambo RuinsThe best way to start a day in Ollantaytambo is to head to the second floor of the produce market for a fresh juice to-go and make the quick climb to the ruins of Pinkuylluna to watch the sun wash over the valley.  These ruins take about 15-30 minutes to ascend and are separate from the main fortress complex which you must pay to enter.  Find the steep but short access trail right in town by walking 3 blocks up Lari Calle, the first cobblestone street on the right as you enter town from Cuzco.Later, an afternoon picnic in an Inca palace along the Urubamba River is in order.  To reach Qellorakay, a second set of free ruins, leave from the produce market and walk straight ahead down a short road. You will be forced to make a left turn as a large field comes into view.  Cutting through this field is an unmarked trail that continues away through agricultural fields.  A flat, 10-minute stroll ends at ruins nestled among terraced fields with a captivating view of the glacier on Mt. Veronica.Day Trips from OllantaytamboFor visitors wishing to explore further afield, the area surrounding Ollanta is rich with rewarding day hikes. Across the river from town, a moderate 4-5 hour round-trip hike leads you to ancient quarries, Las Canteras, where the massive stones to build the town were excavated.Heading up the Patacancha valley behind Ollantaytambo, an easy 3-hour round-trip hike will take you past steep terraces at Media Luna and the wind-swept ruins at Pumamarca.Confident hikers can easily navigate these walks on their own; ask around town for advice and the latest directions. A local hiking guidebook is available at some prominent stores and hotels around town.  And if you’d like to leave the navigation to someone else, most hotels can arrange for a local guide to accompany you with little notice.Visiting OllantaytamboOllantaytambo is an obligatory stop-off for most trips to Machu Picchu. The difference is in how you visit. Rather than force your stay into a whistle-stop tour of the Sacred Valley while en route to Machu Picchu, consider spending a night in the town instead.This gives you a chance to explore the place in its natural state, away from the crowds of day-tripper tourists. The real benefit to staying in the town though is that you can catch the first train direct to Machu Picchu and avoid spending a night in Aguas Calientes, the chaotic town at the foot of Machu Picchu that is usually considered a necessary evil for those who want to visit the world-famous citadel.This article was written by Yampu Tours, who offer trips to Machu Picchu.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-manila/,Things To Do in Manila in a Few Days,Philippines,"When you come to the Philippines, you will most likely land in what locals call Metro Manila. Metro Manila is a group of 16 municipalities within close proximity of each other. Manila City, the country’s capital, is part of Metro Manila. While the Philippines is most known for its beautiful beaches and islands, a few days of exploration in the city gives you an idea of what to expect as you make your way through the country. With a population of over 12 million people, Metro Manila sounds massive.Its interesting mix of tall skyscrapers and gated villages can be overwhelming, but there are many gems to discover. The attractions are diverse and suitable for any kind of traveler, even if you have several kids in tow.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}IntramurosAyala Triangle GardensManila Bay SunsetNational MuseumsShoppingDay TripsEnjoy a few days in ManilaIntramurosIf you’re looking to experience a bit of Manila history, then head over to Intramuros. Referred to as the “walled city”, the centuries-old cobbled steps and nearly three-mile stoned walls definitely solidifies its place as the oldest district in the city. Originally built as the Spaniard’s political and military base in Asia, it eventually became a hub for trade and commerce.Teeming with rich tales from the old colonial times tracing back from the 1500s, you’ll naturally stumble into museums scattered within. For about a dollar and a few cents charge each, you get to experience the past and get a feel of the old city.There’s Casa Manila showcasing Filipino daily life during the Spanish era; the San Agustin Museum that houses paintings, sculptures, and a gallery of recreated pharmacy pots of 16th century drug stores; the National Commission for Culture and the Arts Gallery which exhibits contemporary Filipino art; and the Bagumbayan Light and Sound Museum, an hour’s show that narrates the life of the Philippine’s national hero, Jose Rizal.Interestingly, educational institutions are also housed within the area. Mostly Catholic schools established by the early colonial rulers. So don’t be surprised by all the school-aged, young adolescence presence, they’re hopefully just trying to get to class on time.Once you get tired from all the walking, you can opt to rent a horse-drawn carriage, locally known as kalesa. Costing about $5.00 per person, you can have a guided tour of the walled city and can even explore other places within the immediate vicinity. Make sure you bring your A-game negotiating skills with you though, as kalesa peddlers don’t normally have fixed prices, so the charges can be dependent on the places you’ll visit and the number of stops along the way. Another alternative would be the free e-trikes that ply certain routes. If you have time to plan ahead the museums you’d like to visit, then this would be the cost-efficient choice.Image courtesy of Wiki CommonsAyala Triangle Gardens Set right in the heart of the Central Business district, this 20,000 square meter patch of land can be considered a respite within the concrete jungle. Busy office workers and passers-by alike are often lured by the lush greenery with more than a hundred golden palms, fire trees, and rain trees scattered across the area. An unusual sight within the city, finding a spot to chill to take a break from the daily grind will definitely leave you feeling relaxed.As you explore further, an array of restaurants offering various specialties from regional Filipino cuisine, bakery-cafes, dessert shops, and one targeted for the health-conscious, are found within the confines of this oasis. You definitely would want to visit on an empty stomach.Dropping by in the early morning or late afternoon, you’ll more likely find sweat-drenched health buffs and those who simply want to counter a static lifestyle, taking advantage of the jogging paths lined around the area. With no membership fees and dress codes to worry about, this is the perfect spot to burn the calories away.Pet parents are also encouraged to take their furry kids for walks and socialization as this place is pet-friendly. Ranging from energetic fur balls like Jack Russell Terriers, cute little Chihuahuas, and large but affectionate Huskies, you’ll never run out of cuties to meet.Lastly, the highly anticipated Christmas light show during the holiday season is a must-see. Trees are adorned with light displays that dance to the accompanying music. It is mesmerizing and will definitely have you enthralled. The most recent one was Disney-themed which made it more magical. Oh, and did I mention it’s free? Just be ready to jostle your way into the crowd as it tends to be packed with kids and kids-at-heart alike.Image courtesy of PixabayManila Bay SunsetHaving an unobstructed view of the Manila Bay sunset for a couple of years, sitting in my corner of the office is admittedly, one of the things I look forward to at the end of the workday is a Manila Bay sunset. The calming comfort of the soft orange glow as it sets, slowly turning into hues of blues and violets, seems to tell you that all has ended well.If you’re looking for the perfect way to wind down your one-day exploration, then you may want to do so in this part of the city. Closer to the airport than the other areas in this article, it would be much more convenient to make your way back to the airport from here, more so if you have to catch an early or late evening flight.Finding the perfect spot for a free front-seat view of the natural show is easy, as the 937-lineal meter sea wall provides a lot of retail space. If you have some cash to spare, taking the sunset cruise is another option. For around $30.00, you get unlimited drinks with buffet and have musicians serenade you as you quietly enjoy the hour-long experience. Either way, you’ll be treated to an impressive and strangely comforting display of one of nature’s wonders.A word of caution for all the sun-loving folks out there: before settling in for the day, the majestic Mr. Sun will harshly cast its glowing orange ball of scorching heat, so best to be armed with some sunscreen if you happen to stop by at a time earlier than the sunset is forecast.Image courtesy of Wikimedia CommonsNational MuseumsThe National Museum of the Philippines is found in Manila City. There are three main institutions: the National Museum of Fine Arts, Anthropology, and Natural History, which are located within a few meters of each other. As the government placed heavier emphasis on local culture, these buildings were renovated to look more modern and house many important exhibits. Best of all, they are now free to all visitors all throughout the year.The most popular destination is the National Museum of Fine Arts. Built in 1918, the building was used throughout history to house several government functions. During the Japanese occupation in 1945, the building was bombed and subsequently rebuilt to house the congress. It was only in 1998 that the building was turned over to the National Museum of the Philippines. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2010.The Museum houses many collections from all over the world, but the most revered piece is the larger-than-life Spoliarium by National Artist Juan Luna. It’s one of the most important pieces of art in Philippine history. The painting depicts the gladiators of the Roman Empire, dragged away and bloodied after a fight in the arena. National Hero Jose Rizal himself analyzed the artwork as a raw revelation of the Filipino ordeal during the Spanish regime in the Philippines.Across the Fine Arts Museum is the National Museum of Anthropology. It’s an interesting and extensive collection of artifacts and information about the history of the Filipino people. Exhibits showcase the story of the Filipino people from prehistoric to modern times. Much of Philippine history is centered around the 300-year reign of Spain, but the Museum of Anthropology reveals the long history of Filipino culture, deeply-rooted in natural beliefs and even Islam.The third institution is the Museum of Natural History. It’s one of the most recently-renovated structures and its modern design and unique architecture was the main draw during its reopening. It features a spiral ramp throughout the museum. Visitors learn about the many life forms in the Philippines. There are numerous displays and even walk-through exhibits showcasing the incredible biodiversity that calls the Philippines home.Image courtesy of Wikimedia CommonsShoppingOne of the first things you’ll notice in Metro Manila is the number and size of malls in every city. Filipinos are unashamedly fond of hanging out in malls, partly because of the all-day air-conditioning in this very hot country. Malls in the Philippines come in all shapes and sizes, but you will find some of the best retail stores and restaurants in them.Some of the best-designed malls belong to the Ayala Group of Companies. You’ll find malls such as Greenbelt, Glorietta, and Bonifacio High Street Central in Makati and neighboring Taguig. These malls are beautifully designed with gardens and sculptures. The SM Group has an extensive network of malls, from neighborhood spaces to the biggest mall in the Philippines called the Mall of Asia. These popular malls have an array of retail shops, from high-end boutiques to local brands. There are also department stores for affordable and mid-range apparel, which will be very useful if you need to adjust your wardrobe for your trip to the Philippines.For bargain-hunters, the easiest bargain heaven to navigate is Greenhills in Pasig City. There are places with rock bottom prices such as Divisoria, but these are hard to find and extremely packed with people. Greenhills, however, follows the same market stall concept and bargaining process, but it is housed in a comfortable and air-conditioned mall.If you’re looking for uniquely Filipino items and food, look for Kultura shops. They’re found in SM malls all over the city. Kultura is the Filipino word for “culture”, and this chain of stores features some amazing Filipino and Filipino-inspired items. You’ll find apparel, accessories, and even some local snacks for you to take on your trip or bring back home.Image courtesy of SPumpie on FlickrDay TripsIf you’re not really into the city scene and you’re itching to be one with nature, there are many day trips from Manila you can do.Rising in popularity is the province of Rizal, some two to three hours away from Metro Manila. This once-ignored province is now getting known for its accessibility to nature and ease of transport. A trip to Daranak Falls or a day hike to Mt. Pamitinan gives travelers a quick reprieve from the city’s chaos. Hiring a car to bring you to these places is ideal, but it’s quite easy to use public transportation as well. You jumpstart your outdoor adventure and still be in time to party back in Manila.Another popular day trip destination is Tagaytay City, another 2-hour drive from Metro Manila. Tagaytay is a town situated in Cavite province with an average elevation of about 610 meters (2,000 ft). The climate here is considerably cooler than Metro Manila, which is why it’s a very popular destination, especially in the summer season. There are many restaurants along the Tagaytay Ridge that overlook Taal Lake. It’s a great option to just relax, enjoy the famous Bulalo (beef shank soup), and cool off from the Manila heat.Enjoy a few days in ManilaMetro Manila may be a shock to anyone’s system, but this lively metropolitan city is an exciting place to be. With so many restaurants and bars, the gastronomic experience is bound to be phenomenal. At the same time, there are many places to explore to learn more about Philippine culture and scenery. So if you find yourself passing by, don’t waste your time locked up in your hotel room. Get moving and get to know one of the liveliest cities in Asia.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/island-running-routes/,7 Exotic Island Running Routes,Philippines,"The #runitfast hashtag has now hit 1.2 million posts on Instagram, so fitness expert Erny Peibst has mapped out running routes for all levels on some roads less travelled. Get away from it all and have a well deserved break, immersing yourself in the beautiful scenery and culture these islands have to offer.From mountain peaks to sandy beaches our planet has some incredible landscapes to explore, so pack your bags and get ready to test your endurance on these exotic islands.1. Running Route on Kauai, HawaiiKnown as the ‘Garden Island’ for its lush vegetation and steady rainfall, running on Kauai gives you an unbelievable opportunity to take in some stunning views of nature.Not only is there remarkable scenery, but along the coast, Kauai is home to white-sand beaches that stretch out into the clear turquoise water of the North Pacific Ocean.Tourists usually stick to the north of the Island, staying in places like Princeville so we’ve mapped out a route that will get you away from the busy tourist traps and allows you to take in all the treasures Kauai has to offer.The route will take you on a scenic 4-mile run along ‘The Coconut Coast’ from Wailua to Kealia. The flat, red clay path stretches along coastal cliffs giving you stunning views of the Pacific on one side and of the island’s vegetation on the other. As you take a leisurely run along the track, you may even catch a glimpse of dolphins or whales in the waters below.2. Running Route on Réunion, near MadagascarThis tiny island off the coast of Madagascar is no bigger than Dorset but rises more than 10,000 ft above the ocean and is the perfect place for any dedicated runner to test their abilities.Home to a truly untouched wilderness, the island was formed from 2 volcanoes (one of which is still active) that have created a heart-stopping natural beauty in the middle of the Indian ocean.The route mapped out starts at the small island village, Piton Sainte-Rose. The coastal town has incredible views and is the perfect place to catch the sunrise if you want to start your run early.The run totals 6.8 miles testing you on a range of terrain and revealing some breathtaking views along the way, not only of the Indian Ocean but then turning inland to the dense island vegetation.About three-quarters of the way around you will also come across an unexpected treasure in the form of Anse Waterfalls. A stunning natural waterfall that climbs 15m high with a crystal clear pool at the bottom – the perfect place for you to stop and catch your breath.*The waterfall is not on the trail and requires a slight detour. When you start to hear the sound of spraying water you will see a signpost for the waterfall with a small track that leads off the trail, take a short jog up and you will be blown away by this natural wonder.Photo by James Donaldson on Unsplash3. Running Route on Palaui, PhilippinesMade up of over 7,000 islands, you could spend months enjoying all of the remote and wondrous running trails the Philippines has to offer.If you only have a short amount of time for your trip then the one place you definitely need to go is Palaui. Located on the northeast tip of Luzon, the island is home to the nation’s capital and an international airport, it is incredibly easy to get to and well worth the 14-hour bus ride.The island is tiny but is home to an almost 6-mile trail called The Lagunzad Trail. The terrain is moderately difficult with some steep climbs up and down mountain peaks but the stunning scenery you get to take in along the route makes those burning climbs well worth it.The island was declared a National Marine Reserve in 1994 and gives you the opportunity to explore many untouched sites from white sand beaches and hidden waterfalls to clifftop views of the Philippine Sea – everything you could want from a running holiday this island has to offer.4. Running Route on Santorini, GreeceOne of the longest and most talked about trails on Santorini goes from Fira to Oia; it’s a steady descent for the entire trail but nothing even an amateur runner couldn’t handle.This is a great trail and really gives you a true taste of the Aegean experience. Starting at a picturesque port in Fira, it continues around the rim of the caldera to Oia on the southern tip of the island, passing through historic sights and Greek towns on the way.The trail takes you along spectacular cliff-tops giving you a stunning view of the sparkling blue Aegean sea that stretches for miles ahead.5. Running Route on Corsica, FranceThe French island of Corsica is home to one of the world’s most spectacular trails, the GR 20 that stretches across 111 miles.The trail winds its way along the jagged center of Corsica’s mountain range. Despite the rugged and mountainous terrain, the trail is within the capabilities of most runners.Your starting point is in Calenzana and the trail goes all the way down to Conca but the section mapped out is just 16 miles and ends in Haut-Asco. This northern part of the trail is great if you just want to go for a run rather than spend days trekking the length of the Island.The entire trail is incredibly well marked with red and white blazes so there is no chance of you getting lost as you run through the breathtaking scenery.6. Running Route on DominicaIf you’ve ever wanted to explore the jungle then Dominica is the place to go for your next ‘runcation.’ No poisonous snakes, no scary spiders, Dominica has some of the friendliest jungle in the world and the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail runs through it all.Segment four of the trail stretches from Wotten Waven to Pont Casse and is a great place to get in your run.The trail is shadowed on either side by an abundance of towering trees, buttress roots and dangling vines. One of the most spectacular waterfalls on the Island, Middleham Falls, is on this segment of the trail, the perfect place to stop and catch your breath or cool off and go for a swim.The terrain is moderately difficult, regular rainfall means you might sometimes find yourself slipping and sliding down hills and the jungle landscape means you will have to watch out for tree roots and branches ready to trip you up as you go.*There is a US$12.00 fee for a day pass to get on the trail.7. Running Route at Grace Bay, Turks, and CaicosIf the jungle isn’t really your thing and you’d rather be running across white sand beaches at sunset then Turks and Caicos is probably the island for you.Home to some of the clearest waters and softest white sand beaches you’re ever likely to find, Grace Bay beach is the crown jewel of the Caribbean.As you run along the beach looking out at the ocean, just a mile offshore you can see the protected reefs through the crystal clear water. The beach itself is always pristine (no rocks, seaweed or pollution in sight) and has been named the most breathtaking destination on the globe.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/10-best-street-foods-must-try-southeast-asia/,10 Best Street Foods You Must Try in Southeast Asia,Philippines,"If travel is all about exploring the rich history and local culture of the places you visit, to have a great travel experience you have to indulge yourself in the diverse activities that those places have in store for you. One of the best ways to do this is to delve mouth-first into the local delicacy and wow your tongue with all the pleasant taste of popular foods.If you’re currently visiting or planning a trip to Southeast Asia, then you absolutely have to try the food. The hustling and bustling street food vendors are an integral part of the daily life of Southeast Asian countries. You can get an insight into the ingredients and spices Southeast Asians use in their food when casually conversing with the local people.These are the top street foods which you cannot afford to miss in your next expedition there:1: Boat Noodles (Kuay Teow Reua) – Bangkok, ThailandTo visit Bangkok and not have Boat Noodles should be considered a crime. These small bowls of soup noodles served with a sprinkle of the key ingredient (pig’s blood) has a rich history and cultural aspect attached to it. This dish was originally served from the boats of the huge canal network that Bangkok used to have, and thus the name. While having pig’s blood in their bowl of noodles may discourage some people, the blood gets cooked almost immediately. It comes in touch with the hot broth and gives the dish a unique creamy texture which you’ll only find in Bankok cuisine.While there are vendors selling boat noodles at almost every street corner of Bangkok, ‘Doy Kuay Teow Reua’ near Victory Monument is one of the best places which continues to serve this dish in its original form.2: Green Papaya Salad (Som Tam) – ThailandGreen Papaya Salad is an extremely flavorful and spicy salad made primarily with green papaya, Thai bird’s eye chili and shrimp paste. The dish originates from the North-eastern or Isan region of Thailand. However, you can find varieties of this dish all over Thailand. If you want to taste this dish in Bangkok, you can head over to a place called Som Tam Jay So, which serves a replica of the various versions of Som Tam you will find in the Isan region.3: Stir-Fried Pork with Holy Basil (Pad Kra Pao ) – ThailandThis is a staple food of many office goers and local people of Thailand, and in Bangkok, you will find some of the best versions of this dish. The street food vendors of Bangkok have taken this everyday dish to a mouth-watering level, and while visiting Bangkok, you cannot waste an opportunity of tasting this delicious stir-fried dish. It is served with a side of fried egg and steamed rice. Just mix the rice with a bit of meat and egg, and you’ll be in taste heaven.4. Sticky Rice (xôi) – VietnamThe Vietnamese know how to prepare rice in various ways. In the streets, you would find the sticky rice that could have a sweet or salty taste. There is the sticky corn rice (xôi bắp), common in northern Vietnam that is comprised of softly cooked corn mixed with rice then topped with green mung bean and tasty fried shallots. This style of preparation makes it sugary. The salty one (xôi mặn) is comprised of rice, dried shrimp, green onion, and Chinese sausage stirred with oil and flavored with soy sauce.Explore rice in Vietnam and find out what it tastes like when various ingredients are is mixed with it. You will be surprised.5. Roll Cake (Bánh Cuốn) – VietnamJust like a sandwich in the west, Vietnamese like to get creative with whatever they put in rolls of food. This is evident in their popular roll cakes known as (Bánh cuốn). The rolls are made of thin slices of baked dough. There are two different styles of roll cake that you would come across in the streets. There are those filled primarily with pork meat known as (bánh cuốn nhân thịt) and those filled with steamed rice served with spicy fish sauce, bean sprouts and herbs known as “bánh ướt” (wet cake). They are normally sold on moving carts. If you spot one, hurry up and catch it before it gets away!6: Green Tea Salad (Laphet Thohk) – MyanmarAt the street side tea stalls of Myanmar, you’ll often find various salads that you can have with your tea. Among those, the unique and popular salad is the Laphet Thohk. It is a salad made with pickled tea leaves, peanuts, tomatoes, green chilies, lime juice, and different sauces. The end result is a very unique, tangy, spicy, saucy mixture, which you must try while you are in Myanmar.7: Chinese Style Barbeque – Yangon, MyanmarThe Chinese colonies of Myanmar play a huge part in its culture and history. So your journey to Yangon will be incomplete if you don’t pay a visit to the Chinatown of Yangon. The 19th street of Chinatown, which is popularly known as the Barbecue Street, is famous for its street food vendors selling Chinese-style barbecued goodies. Just grab a table, order whatever looks nice, have a beer and indulge in the action-packed environment.8: Pork/Chicken Adobo – PhilippinesThis may be the most popular dish of the Philippines, and you really need to try it while you’re there. Tender pieces of meat marinated in vinegar and soy sauce, this dish is easily available on the street side, and it is a great experience to have this famous dish in its homeland.9: Banana-Q – PhilippinesAll you sweet lovers must not miss the opportunity to taste this extremely popular evening snack of the locals of the Philippines. The dish is made with a local variety of banana called ‘Saba,’ which is coated in brown sugar, deep-fried and then skewered on a stick like a piece of barbecued meat. You can find this dish everywhere throughout the Philippines, especially during the evening time.10: Balut – PhilippinesThis might not be the most appetizing street food you can have while you’re in the Philippines, but it is almost certainly the most unique one. Balut is a developing duck embryo, still in its shell, boiled and eaten in one gulp. It is considered an aphrodisiac by the locals, and though not for the faint-hearted, still it is one of the most unique street food experiences you can have in the Philippines.That’s my list of awesome street foods to look for as you go about your adventure in Southeast Asia. If missing something feels free to share here.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/batad-rice-terraces/,Batad Rice Terraces – The Philippines,Philippines,"The Philippines are known for both adventure and luxury travel and my last trip to the Philippines included some of both.Banuae is not about luxury, it is about adventure. We took a Jeepney to the nearby Batad and Bangaan rice terraces  (see A Love Affair with Jeepneys – Rice Terraces of the Cordillera, Philippines). These terraces were built by the local people 2000 years ago up the sides of the hills and were breathtaking… especially when you hike them. The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and justly so.It is a relatively easy 20-minute hike from the end of the road to where you can view the village of Batad. Just a few years ago the road ended on the other side of the hill, so I was grateful they had extended it as far as they did. From the restaurants at the top with a view, things get more difficult if you want to visit the village. Hiking down starts with cement steps but partway down the steps become irregular stones stuck in the side of the stone walls of the terraces. In places, you are walking along the terrace walls with a rice paddy on one side and a 6-foot drop on the other.I traveled to Bananu in a group of bloggers. One had to opt-out partway down the descent because of a bad hip, one needed some help getting back up, one had muscle cramps on the assent. I had to go slower than I wanted because hiking stairs was tiring me out faster than the hikes I had done to prepare for the trip. Three of the bloggers did relatively well despite the heat and humidity.When we were in the village we were told not to take pictures of the locals as the local belief held that a picture steals your soul. I can’t imagine what they would think about Instagram. We bought cool drinks in the village. They did not charge enough for those drinks since everything has to be carried into the village by hand.Looking back at my pictures I noticed I took a lot more from the rim than I did down in the village or on the tough climb back out. During the climb, my mind was on other things.We also stopped at the village of Bangaan which is “only” 100 steps down into the village. By that time, 3 of our group opted out which did mean that I was the slowpoke. Our guide had married a woman from the village and had lived in the village for a time. He stopped to visit someone who lived in one of the traditional Ifugao houses. The houses are raised off the ground with disks on the posts to keep out any rats that might want to eat the rice in the attic.Throw In a ride in and on top of a Jeepney to and from the villages and this trip was a very different view of the Philippines than you can get from the club level of a luxury hotel. It is a more challenging trip, but worth the effort.In Manila, I stayed at the Diamond Hotel where I was in one of the club rooms on the 24th floor. The room itself was lovely but the real treat was the 25th-floor club where the service was very attentive. There is something wonderful about being greeted by name by someone who knows what kind of tea you like. “‘Mr. Chris, can I get you a cup of Earl Grey tea?” It seemed that the room was always stocked with breakfast, or “snacks” where snacks wee substantial enough to be a meal.Diamond Hotel – check reviews | check prices: Agoda | Booking.com | ExpediaI also stayed at the busy Belmont Hotel which is a boutique hotel at the airport. I got some work done by the pool and bar on the rooftop terrace where you could watch planes taking off and landing from the airport across the street. In Manila traffic, even a hotel across the street from Terminal 1 can be 15 minutes away, and as much as an hour away from Terminal 2.Belmont Hotel – check reviews | check prices: Agoda | Booking.com | ExpediaBy contrast, the Banaue Hotel and Youth Hostel in Banuae is paneled in dark wood like your Uncle Bob’s old rec room. The hotel did not have a club level, flat-screen TVs (or any TV at all). It did have a charming cultural show at night that displayed some of the dances from the local Ifugau people. Best of all, it had a view of some of the local rice terraces that attract tourists to the region.Belmont Hotel – check reviews | check prices: AgodaDon’t ask me to choose between luxury and adventure in the Philippines, my choice is a little of both… but next time I might opt for the remote beach instead of the tough hike… although I hear there are also volcanos to climb.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/jeepneys-philippines-video/,"A Love Affair with Jeepneys – Rice Terraces of the Cordillera, Philippines (Video #87)",Philippines,"I had the best seat in the house. I was sitting on some pieces of cardboard on top of the spare tire tied to the roof of a Jeepney, bouncing along the roads near Banaue in the Philippines.right click here to download video (Small)right click here to download video (Large)My Thanks to Richard from Travel Tramp for the pictures of me on the Jeepney and the hike.You have probably seen pictures of the Jeepney. The Filipinos took the old American Jeep design and turned it from something utilitarian to something with a bit more style. It was extended to allow more people to ride inside. It is decorated and often has a slogan where you would expect to find a destination on a regular bus. From Manila to the highlands of Cordillera, the jeepney is an efficient way to get from one place to another.Exploring Intramuros – The Old Walled City in Manila, Philippines (and Video 86)UpscaleThe first Jeepney that I road in Manila as part of a tour of the old walled part of the city, Intramuros. This Jeepney had some upgrades. The benches along the side had been replaced by seats, there was air-conditioning and a karaoke machine. It was a fun experience to be sure, but nothing like a typical Jeepney rides (I should point out that I got decent points for my rendition of “Blowing in the Wind” but was no competition to two French bloggers Antoine and Violette from Life Explorateurs who belted out “When the Lights Go Down in the City”). Regular Jeepneys do ply the streets of Manila on regular routes but you may need to ask a local to figure out which one to board, but since English is an official language of the Philippines asking a local is easy.CordilleraWe had a more typical Jeepney experience when we got on board one in Banaue to visit the local Rice Terraces of Cordillera UNESCO site. When I say we hopped on, I do mean on as on top of. The locals say the best seat is sitting on the rack on top of the Jeepney with nothing for padding but a few pieces of cardboard. Don’t let them fool you, the best seat is definitely the spare tire. While the view from the open windows of the Jeepney of this amazing landscape is good, it does not compare to watching the world go by from the top.Is it safe? Heck no. Please, no one tell my mother I did this. But these vehicles can not go very fast on these mountain roads, so I told myself I would probably survive.HitchhikersEven though we were on a private tour the Jeepney got more than a few hitchhikers up the steep hills. Kids would jump on and hold on to the ladders on the back of the Jeepney in a fashion that would give the car seat lobby a heart-attack. The driver seemed to know which kid went with which family and would slow down a bit at the house at the top of the hill so they could jump off again. The local village chief joined us inside for a ride. Since she was a bit tipsy, it was probably just as well she didn’t hold onto the outside.FutureThe Jeepney is an endangered sight. There are still many of them in the Philippines but the production of them by creator Sarao Motors has gone from building out 12-18 units a day to just 40 a year because there are more economical vehicles than the Jeepney. So if you want a Jeepney ride, you had better book your ticket to the Philippines soon. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/old-city-manila-philippines/,"The Old Walled City in Manila, Philippines – Exploring Intramuros (Video 86)",Philippines,"Manila is a sprawling city of 14 million people. It has challenging traffic and crowds. But within this modern city is still the old colonial walled city, the Intramuros. During the Spanish colonial period, this was the Spanish “Green Zone”. “Within the walls” or Intramuros was where those with Spanish blood lived while the natives lived outside the city walls, “extramuros”.We traveled to the Intramuros neighborhood in a suped-up Jeepnee with air conditioning, bus seats and a karaoke machine complete with flat-screen display. Karaoke seemed appropriate since our tour guide John Elton was named after pop-star Elton John. He has a brother named John Lennon.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Rizal ParkCathedralHorse Drawn CartBaluarte de San DiegoCasa ManilaSan Agustin ChurchConclusionright click here to download video (Small)right click here to download video (Large)Rizal ParkOur first stop was at the monument to national hero José Rizal at Rizal Park. Writer, nationalist, polyglot and ophthalmologist José Rizal helped spark the revolt against the Spanish with his novels, poems, and essays. Although not directly involved in the revolution the Spanish executed him on this spot for instigating it. When referring to Rizal, our guides simply call him THE National Hero and a stop at his monument is nearly mandatory.For more information about Rizal visit the museum in nearby Fort Santiago where he was imprisoned. His last footsteps are commemorated in bronze on the ground there.Rizal Park has continued to be a gathering point for major events in Madrid including protests or a mass during the 2015 visit by Pope Francis.CathedralMuch of Manila in general and Intramuros specifically was destroyed in World War II. We started our tour of the city at the cathedral which is the heart of the city in this mostly catholic country. The cathedral has been built 8 different times since its foundations were laid in 1571. It has been destroyed by fire, earthquakes, and war.The most recent version of Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception was completed in 1958.Outside were horse-drawn carts and vendors selling straw hats while inside large groups were walking the stations of the cross in the various chapels.Horse Drawn CartWe boarded one of the horse-drawn carts for a stylish ride through the city. Manila is a bit humid for walking around for long periods of time so sitting in the shade while the horse did the walking, worked for me. Our driver told us that our horse was a retired racehorse.Baluarte de San DiegoYou can get up on the old Spanish walls of the city at the Baluarte de San Diego gardens. These thick walls date from 1587. The old guardhouses here are typical of Spanish construction and reminded me of El Moro in San Juan, Puerto Rico and other Spanish fortresses from the 16th century.These walls kept out pirates but were breached by the British when they captured the city in 1762 during the Seven Years’ War. The walls were obsolete by the time of the Japanese conquest in 1942. U.S. And Filipino soldiers abandoned the city, declaring it an open city to spare the civilians. They then retreated to the more defensible Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island where they held out 3 more months before surrendering.This area along with much of Intramuros was destroyed in the liberation of the Philippines in 1945. Intramuros remained in ruins until the 1980s but now the Baluarte de San Diego is surrounded by gardens and sees more weddings than invasions.Casa ManilaWe visited the Casa Manila which is a reconstruction of the home of one of the wealthy families that lived in the Intramuros. The house is a reconstruction but the items in the home are originals. A home like this boasted goods from all over the world. Much of the artwork was from china, the woodcarving from the Philippines and the piano from the U.S. The family private chapel was painted in the style of a Gothic Cathedral. The second floor is surrounded by windows that can be opened to let in a breeze. Or the windows can be closed to the breeze but let in light through translucent sea shells window panes.Life inside the walls was good. During the Spanish period, education and opportunity were only available to those with Spanish blood. While the American colonization started with a bitter war, the Americans introduced public education which is why so much English is found in the Philippines and so little Spanish despite the much longer Spanish presence.Casa Manila is definitely worth a visit, but no pictures are allowed.San Agustin ChurchOf the 7 churches inside the city walls, only one of the old churches from the colonial period survived WWII. That church, San Agustin Church, is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The church was finished in 1607.Take the time to explore the attached museum which chronicles the history of the Augustinian monks who brought Christianity to the Philippines. Look for the picture of the earthquake damage that the church sustained in the 1800s and for the collection of ivory used for faces and hands of religious figurines.ConclusionThe Intramuros was my favorite part of Manila. It is worth a visit, and if you throw in a kaoroka Jeepnee, what’s not to love.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/cebus-top-3-tourist-spots/,Cebu’s Top 3 Tourist Spots,Philippines,"Cebu is a small yet immensely popular island in the Philippines.  It is also the location of the first Spanish settlement of the country; this is where Ferdinand Magellan landed, fought and died.  As such, the place is steeped in history, making it a very interesting place for tourists.  Though the island has quite a few places of interest, listed below are some of the more famous ones to which tourists flock in very large numbers.  Here are the top three tourist spots of Cebu.Mactan Shrine – This shrine was made to commemorate the achievement of Lapu Lapu, a native Filipino whose men resisted and defeated Portugese explorer Magellan’s men.  A life size statue made of bronze has been erected in his honor in the city named after him. Interestingly, there is also a monument dedicated to the vanquished Magellan who died in this battle.  This monument is known as Magellan’s Obelisk. Every year in April, the Kadaguan Festival stages a mock battle to relive the historic fight for sovereignty.  The festival is quite a colorful and entertaining affair with famous actors participating in the battle re-enactment.  Arrangements are made for fresh seafood to be served and a whole bunch of stalls crop up where one can splurge on cheap Filipino souvenirs.Cebu Taoist Temple – The Cebu Taoist Temple was constructed in 1972 by the city’s significant Chinese population.  300 meters above sea level, this temple is an imposing, multi layered colorful structure.  It has three approaches and welcomes worshippers as well as non-worshippers.  At the entrance to the temple is a mini Great Wall of China.  A huge, winding dragon statue can be seen in the front garden.  There is also a library, a chapel, a souvenir shop and a wishing well.  Every devotee who comes here is looking for a wish to be granted.  The ritual is to wash your hands and enter the temple barefoot and drop two blocks of wood.  If these blocks land face up, then the time is ripe to ask the gods for your wish, if not then you’ve got to repeat the pilgrimage and try your luck another time!  Non-worshippers who come here are required to maintain the sanctity of the temple by keeping their volume at a minimum and refraining from taking pictures of the altar.  This is a very popular tourist site and is very often offered as a side trip in a city tour by Cebu holiday tourist travel guides.Magellan’s Cross – Magellan’s Cross, a symbol of the King of Spain’s Catholic Legacy was planted by Magellan when he arrived in Cebu in 1521. One of the most prominent landmarks of Cebu’s religious, the wooden cross is housed in a rotunda right next to the Basilica Minore del Santo Nino. The original cross, supposed to have special powers is believed by some to be contained within the cross that is on display, to save it from souvenir hunters.  But many believe that the original cross was lost or destroyed by the time Magellan died, and this one is a replica placed there after the Philippines was fully colonized by the Spaniards. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/take-a-sweet-escape-to-the-philippines-best-undiscovered-islands/,"Philippines’ Best Undiscovered Islands (Camiguin, Palawan, Boracay)",Philippines,"Just because you’ve joined the throngs of tourists flocking to Cebu and shopped Makati in Metro Manila, don’t think you’ve experienced all the Philippines has to offer.With over 7,000 picturesque islands, there are plenty of undiscovered tropical paradises with beautiful beaches, clear blue sea, and coral reefs to explore. Of course, “undiscovered” doesn’t really mean that the island has never had human contact. In fact, most of the islands you might travel to have some form of resort on them.So, why call them “undiscovered”? Because these places are off the beaten tourist path – they’re not part of the mainstream. While they may have settlers and resorts, the vast majority of the land on these islands is left to nature. Just take a stroll away from your hotel or hut, and you’re likely to find a beach that you can have all to yourself.Which islands should you go to in order to get this slice of natural beauty? Well, that depends on what you’re looking for, because every place has unique aspects to them that might appeal to different people. Here are just a few of my favorite “undiscovered” islands for you to choose from.BoracayIf you’re only feeling just a tiny bit adventurous, you might want to check out Boracay. Like Cebu, Manila, and other popular destinations in the Philippines, parts of it are pretty built up with nice resorts that offer plenty of activities. It’s also home to several beaches that always seem to rank highly in all those “world’s best beach” lists, and it’s a very popular party destination, offering plenty of restaurants, bars, and clubs for all your nightlife desires.For the island’s best paluto restaurant, check out Smoke. You can order Filipino food a la carte or – my favorite – bring your own ingredients and they will cook it for you! In the mood for a Swedish, Accupressure or Shiatsu massage? Most of the masseuses around don’t have that kind of training, but there is one – Abe (it pronounced Abby), a blind masseur that works in Angol outside of Cocoloco restaurant.With all of this, why is Boracay still considered undiscovered? Because most of it is still covered with huge mountains, hidden caves, wildlife, and tucked away beaches. I like to leave touristy White Beach behind and join the locals across the island at Puka Beach. Or watch kiteboarders do their thing on windy days at Bulabog Beach.And while snorkeling and scuba diving is nice, you can’t leave without hiring a guide to take you to the Bat Cave. It’s way off the beaten path, and climbing down into the mouth requires quite a bit of care to avoid slipping on the rocks and bat guano, but it’s a sight to behold. Even better, you can get two for the price of one by also checking out the nearby Crystal Cave and climbing up to look out over the sea. Just don’t be afraid to haggle with the guide a bit; most will quote you 2500P, but that’s considered the “tourist” rate. PalawanThe largest province in the Philippines, Palawan is made up of almost 2,000 different islands. Some of the islands boast incredibly nice resorts, but many others are virtually untouched by human hands. For a very affordable rate, you can hire a boat to take you around to some of these islands so you can snorkel, cliff dive, rock climb, or hike in some of the most beautiful places in the world.Unfortunately, flying to Palawan can be a bit anxiety inducing. Not because you’ll have to travel in tiny propeller planes over shark-infested waters, but because before getting on one of these planes, everything you own – including you – will have to be weighed. In front of other people. Go over the weight limit and your bags will have to fly separately – or you might not be allowed to fly at all!If you do travel to Palawan, though, you have to check out two places. The first is El Nido, home to what has been called the best beach in the world, as well as some of the best fishing, bird watching, kayaking, lagoon tours, diving, and snorkeling I’ve ever experienced. The second must-visit attraction is the awesome Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park, which is home to the world’s longest underground river. Words can’t describe what it’s like to take a boat tour through this amazingly unique place, which was recently chosen as one of the New7Wonders of Nature.CamiguinIf you’re the type of person who likes heat and adventure and you’re tired of all the resorts, Camiguin is just the place for you. It is called “The Island Born of Fire,” and though it’s small in size, it is home to many volcanoes you can hike and explore, as well as a number of gorgeous waterfalls. One of the best – Katibawasan Falls – lies just on the outbound range of Mt. Hibok-Hibok, and once you see it you won’t want to leave.Are you more into relaxation? That works too, because few things melt your worries away better than Camiguin’s soothing hot springs, and the pristine white beaches are perfect for lying out in the sun without worry of being disturbed by obnoxious tourists.Just as easygoing and relaxing is the food, with plenty of simple but bountiful dishes that feel like home-cooked meals. Try the extremely rare tabon-tabon fruit with tuna, or a local dessert delicacy called a kiping – sheets of fried rice topped with coconut syrup.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/the-kalasha-people-of-northern-pakistan/,The Kalasha People of Northern Pakistan,Pakistan,"The narrow bridge led to another world. The journey, up the steep valley along a bumpy, precipitous track barely wide enough for a jeep, took two long hours. The other world was the small hamlet of Balanguru, high up in the Rumbur Valley of Northern Pakistan.Rumbur ValleyIn this land of glaciers, barren landscapes, jagged high mountains, and sunlit fertile fields are three valleys in which the Kalasha people (Kalash people) live. This one, the Rumbur, is home to about 300 of their estimated 4000 population.Jamil, a lithe, handsome clean-shaven twenty-year-old with a broad welcoming smile and mischievous blue eyes greeted me with tea and bread at the simple, newly built guesthouse. The smell of freshly cut wood mixed with the aroma of the warm bread laid out on a rickety table surrounded by four ill-matched and unsteady chairs. It was there, a little while later that I was introduced to Jamil’s father, Saifullah Jan, the chief of the Kalasha in this valley. Wearing a plain brown shalwar kameez, he is a gentle quietly spoken middle-aged man with lightly tanned skin, unkempt greying hair and bushy eyebrows that shaded intelligent, laconic pale blue eyes.KalashaThere are many theories about where the Kalasha’s pale blue eyes and fair complexion came from. One says from the Kurds, another that they were originally nomads from the Central Asian Steppes. A more widely held view is the Kalasha are descendants of Alexander the Great’s army that passed through this region around 300BC. Despite a lack of oral history, the chief believes the Kalasha were a tough warrior tribe from Kafiristan – ‘land of the infidels’, which is now Nuristan or ‘land of the light’, a region of modern-day Afghanistan just a few miles up the valley. Wherever their background there is no doubt the Kalasha are unique both in looks and culture.The chief introduced Shakil, the middle of his three sons, who was to be my guide. Unlike his father, Shakil was swarthy with darker skin and hair, deep penetrating green eyes and a serious, thoughtful way about him. His excellent English was delivered, disconcertingly, in the staccato bursts of a drill sergeant. Where did he learn to speak such good English I wondered?: “SCHOOL” he bellowed and with that we were off for a walk to the summer fields an hour or so up the valley.As the steepness increased and the track narrowed, I noticed how the heat of the day was tempered by the natural air conditioning effect of the freezing glacial water rushing a few feet from our path. Perched on a rock was a small grey concrete hydro-electric station which provided power to the hamlets and villages dotted along the valley.Kalasha ReligionAfter an arduous climb away from the river we reached a collection of small green fields which led to a wood of tall slender dark brown trees dotted with small, single-story stone buildings around which woodsmoke billowed and children played. Beyond the houses is a temple. The Kalasha are animists, they worship many gods and believe that all things, including plants, animals, humans, weather possess a spirit.  Their temple was about thirty meters square. In the center sat a plinth of stones covered in bundles of dry spindly twigs, above which were basic wood carvings of horse heads. The whole temple is surrounded by a crude twig fence along which wooden posts carved with lattice and geometric designs are set at regular intervals.I missed the very recent branch laying ceremony when men placed a twig on the plinth for each member of their family. In front lay the charcoal remains of a fire on which a sacrificial goat had been cooked. No women are allowed in or near the temple.There is an odd dichotomy in the attitude to women in Kalasha society. On the one hand, the women, who wear headdresses woven with cowrie (small egg-shaped shells), black robes heavily embroidered with brightly colored wool and small orange, yellow and green bead necklaces are free to marry who they like. They can choose to divorce, initiate elopement both inside and outside of marriage and are not judged nor frowned upon when engaging with men unrelated to them. Women of all ages in the hamlet freely associated with me, alone or in the company of other females, and most were happy to be photographed.On the other hand, they are considered ‘impure’. Shakil pointed out a couple of large buildings behind a compound of high stone walls set away from the hamlet by an eddy in the river. This is the Bashaleni he told me, where menstruating women and those in labor are segregated before returning home, but not before ritually washing themselves, fully clothed in the river.Life of the KalashaHaving gone to bed at nightfall exhausted from walking at higher altitudes, I woke early the next morning to the sound of the river coursing its way down the valley. The air still had a pre-dawn coolness; although the sun was up it had not penetrated the steep narrow valley. The myna birds, unseen in the surrounding trees, welcomed the day with their chirps and squawks amidst mithering babies and families outside cooking and talking, the air above them hazy from their stoves’ woodsmoke.From my rooftop vantage point, I was distracted by the flecks of orange, green and yellow threads embroidered into women’s dresses against the monotone grey-brown houses. The men dressed in drab-colored shalwar kameez were barely discernible.The hamlet has a one jeep width road running through it off which lead alleyways and steps. The walls of the houses are built up of large rocks from the riverbed, reinforced with a lattice of interlocking timbers and held together with grey-brown mud. The squat houses huddled higher on the slopes, away from floods, were designed to withstand earthquakes. The roof of one house is the terrace for the one above, on which I saw vivid orange apricots and off-white mulberries drying out on colorful sheets.Later, walking past homes I caught glimpses of the single room interiors, illuminated only from a small opening in the ceiling through which the smoke from the winter stove escaped. In one home, rough, worn reddish-brown carpets lined the floor, along three walls, were raised platforms covered with colorful blankets used as seating during the day and communal beds at night. The remaining wall space was a mish-mash of shelves and cubby holes storing the family’s pots, pans, plates and jars of fruit, lentils, and flour. I imagined the family in winter all wrapped in blankets huddled around the stove keeping warm and drinking tea.Kalasha CraftsI noticed one woman hand-spinning bright green wool on a large bobbin. Her left hand twiddled while the right sent the bobbin into a gyroscopic spin. Eventually, these colorful threads would be turned into the embroidered flowers, leaves and motifs which decorate the black robes and headdresses worn by the women, young and old.Further along, a group of women squatted on low stools sewing small colorful beads and cowrie shells on to Kapas, the ceremonial headdresses used in the main Kalasha festival which takes place every August. This three day ‘Uchal’ festival celebrates the harvest with singing and dancing at the neighboring hamlet’s Dancing Place, a large covered square at the top of a steep incisor shaped hill. Young girls, meanwhile, unsuccessfully, tried to corral half-naked grubby toddlers playing around the charred remains of breakfast’s fire.Hike to the Afghan BorderI stopped at a shop to buy water, biscuits, and fruit for a planned ten-kilometer hike to the head of the valley where, on the virtual border with Afghanistan, was an old Nuristani village. The shopkeeper invited me into his adjoining home. The large inner courtyard, with three rooms off it, was a playground for nine or so youngsters busy running around, climbing, hiding and playing tag. Three generations of women sat around chatting, laughing and occasionally glancing up to check on the children. In a small lean-to, I was surprised to see a homemade still dispensing clear and pure mulberry alcohol drop-by-drop into a large green bottle.Later, as the sun was leaving the valley and dusk approached, my nose twitched with the citrus notes of freshly cut Juniper trees. There was a different timbre and cadence between the sounds of the hamlet in the evenings and mornings. Voices seemed louder; the swishing of yards being swept more urgent, young children ran, jumped and shouted joyfully. A game of football took place on a roof beside a group of young boys play fighting. On another roof a girl and boy flirted, she doe-eyed and gently slapping his arm, him taking the punishment with a coy smile. Quite suddenly day become night, Small lanterns and bare bulbs illuminated the faces on verandas with a ghostly pallor. Sounds became muted as conversations were hushed as the younger children had gone to bed.ConclusionReluctantly, I left the next morning to continue my travels in the region. It is easy to assume this hamlet is an oasis of calm and serenity nestled in a happy valley but walking with Shakil through Muslim hamlets on the way to the Afghanistan border I sensed an uneasy truce between these disparate cultures. This was confirmed over tea with Saifullah Jan. He spoke earnestly of regular court attendances seeking protection for his people from proselytizing imams, dealing with logging rights disputes and fighting for central government grants. All of which seemed to weigh heavily on his shoulders.Despite threats to their unique culture, the Kalasha remain a steadfastly peaceful, welcoming and hospitable people who live in an enchanted corner of Northern Pakistan.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/the-road-to-islamabad-pakistan/,The Road to Islamabad – Pakistan,Pakistan,"Traveling from Murree to Islamabad got much easier several years ago when the motorway was completed providing a lovely two-lane divided highway for travel. It is normally a quick jaunt on a link road from Jhika Gali to the motorway. But we no longer have that luxury, as part of the link road was washed out during the monsoon season. So instead you head out of town on a different route, this adds about 15 more minutes to the journey, unless of course, you are riding with one of the school’s lead-foot drivers.My most recent journey started with rounding up two students that needed to go to the orthodontist. Our van and driver were waiting and ready to go, and we pulled out promptly at 1430. I had packed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and water for the 2 boys as they were going to miss afternoon teatime. Our driver quickly made it through Jhika Gali, which is no small feat, as there is always lots of foot and motor traffic.At this point in time, I am able to take off my headscarf; we wear them to show respect when around the locals that we do business with. Next, we headed past the army base with some trucks full of soldiers, through another small town, and then down a hill past a local amusement park. I have never seen anyone riding on any of the rides at this site, which includes a fairly large Ferris wheel. At last, we were on the motorway. As you travel along you are struck by how red and rocky the soil is. You also notice how easily it is eroded; tree roots are exposed and many small rock slides dot the sides of the roadway. Monsoon season was particularly long this year and the damage is evident.It is always amazing to me how many people, animals, and little shops populate this motorway. Today we drive past school children, both girls with their white dupattas, and boys in their dark pants and white shirts, dragging their backpacks and slates home. Some will walk home, and others are climbing into ornately decorated, canopied Suzuki Bolan pick-up trucks. Often 15 or more people ride in and on these mini-sized pickups.There are also many men and women just using the motorway for traveling. I used to wonder where they were all going; some are likely heading home from work, while others may be going to a small shop for groceries or other necessities. I also wondered where they came from, as there are not many homes right on the motorway. Instead, if you look down along the steep hills you see many homes dotting the landscape.Small footpaths connect the motorway to these homes and villages. You often see men just sitting along the motorway passing time. As well there are lots of little fruit stands and eateries along this road. Some are folks selling just roasted corn others are more elaborate sit down restaurants. Today I watch as a man stokes the fire under his big pot of oil, for cooking pakoras. Animals are just one more element along the roadway. Today we drive past a dog, many spotted cows, some goats, and the first herd of sheep that I have seen here. Last week I also saw 2 camels being lead along. As well today I am able to observe two donkeys being used to haul cinderblock and sand up a hill, the term “beast of burden” becomes quite literal.The motorway is a wonderfully smooth road, with only a few carefully planned speed bumps—right before a sharp turn. These cause our driver to slow way down as we drive over them. Although the road is smooth it is in no way a good road for those with a tendency towards car-sickness. The road winds back and forth down the hills for about 5000ft to Islamabad. The temperature goes up about 30 degrees and the air becomes quite hazy as you get close to the city.Our driver kindly switches on the aircon as we get descend.After about an hour on the motorway, we come to the toll booth, everyone must stop here and pay the 25 rupee fee to help maintain the road. Once past this booth, it is not much further into the city. Right next to the toll booth is a strange shop with huge fiberglass animal sculptures—dinosaurs, a shark, and a giraffe family.Next, we travel through a small town just outside Islamabad. The sides of the road are full of people, and stalls selling everything from blankets to garlic. There are also schools, medical clinics, and a mosque. People travel by foot, taxi, Suzuki van, or motorbike. I don’t think I will ever get used to seeing a whole family; mom, dad, and several children all stacked on one of these little motorbikes. As well there are large trucks which are ornately decorated with paintings, figurines, chains, and lights. These move slowly up and down the motorway, carrying their loads of anything from building supplies to livestock.When we finally reach Islamabad we enter the city by traveling around a large traffic circle call a chowk. This brings us to the main roadway in Islamabad. Our driver navigates the heavy traffic well—again a large mix of pedestrians, motorbikes, bicycles and even several horse-drawn carts. At each stoplight solicitors or beggars come up to the vehicles trying to get a handout or sell their wares. The air is smoggy here and hot. You can feel it in your eyes and throat. Finally, we reach our destination after about an hour and a half of traveling. We spent roughly 30 minutes at the orthodontist, after which we e head back into the van for our ride home.We see roughly the same things on the ride home, except that this time there are many women on the road with their water pots. Some are carrying the empty pots in their hands, others have the full ones perched upon their heads—perfectly balanced as they head back home. There are also men carrying large bundles of sticks home in the same manner.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/4-terrifying-places-in-europe/,4 Scariest Places in Europe,Poland,"People always tend to go on and on about the hundreds of marvelous destinations as well as the many romantic getaways ideal for a holiday with your beloved one. However, since I’m more of a solo traveler, I love to travel alone, so these romantic places are of pretty much no interest for me. On the other hand, being an avid backpacker, I’ve pretty much covered all the places that are worth visiting in my home Europe. That is why, I started thinking about something along the lines of the unusual. Not the average traveling ideas you can find in all guidebooks. And then, I finally got it! Since I’m going to be on my own, why not find some places where I can be scared out of my wits?I’m usually into extraordinary types of adventures and, being a big fan of horror movies, consider myself not easily scared. That is what actually made me embark on a journey to visit the top four most terrifying places in Europe. However, note that some of the places are not particularly scary. What actually makes them give you chills down the spine is the mystery and legends they are shrouded in.1. Catacombs of ParisI decided the first stop of my horror journey to be France and to gradually advance east. That’s why my first destination was the Catacombs of Paris. Filled with genuine human skulls and bones, the Catacombs have been created in the eighteenth century. It is basically situated under the city center streets. I had been to Paris before but never have I given it much of a thought what is there under my feet.What led to the ‘building’ of the Catacombs is the fact that the Parisian cemetery that had been used for nearly ten centuries became a source of infection and got many people seriously sick. Therefore, in 1786 the removal of the bones was performed.Nowadays, the Catacombs are an alternative tourist attraction where you can walk around the maze-like corridors along with the remains of about six million Parisians. I definitely found the place worth the visit, especially if you have nerves of steel and the sight of millions of human bones doesn’t make you nauseated.2. AuschwitzNow, the next one really made me shiver. The Auschwitz concentration camp. We have all seen movies about World War II and archive footage of the so-called ‘camps of death’, but experiencing everything firsthand gives you a whole different feeling than watching it on film.The Auschwitz concentration camp is situated in Southern Poland. It consists of hundreds of wood-houses where, during the Second World War, German Nazis would keep hundreds of thousands of Jews, gypsies and others who they considered ‘inferior’.Walking around these places, where people literally starved and toiled to death gave me a feeling I had never experienced before. The grimmest one you can imagine. Millions of people were executed in these camps. Those interested can now enter the grounds of the camp and, while following an expert guide, explore this terrifying place. I took advantage of that opportunity, and I strongly advise you to do so, too, because having a guide contributes to the better understanding of what had been happening there. The very thought of it can scare you stiff.3. Bran CastleBran Castle is one of the places I had in mind when mentioning sites that are shrouded in mystery and legends. Located in the Transylvania province in Central Romania, near the city of Brasov, the Bran Castle is known to have been home to the infamous Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula. Now, this is something that cannot be proved for sure, but it is widely claimed.This historic figure made famous by Bram Stoker’s novel is known to have been very strict and to have impaled criminals for even the smallest felony. This led to the belief that he was blood-thirsty and that is why he was portrayed the way he was in the aforementioned novel.Precisely because of these legends, I literally consider the castle to be one of the creepiest places one can visit. Especially if you have seen the movie or have read the novel, like myself, you will constantly look behind your back scared that a vampire might appear silently from one of the dark and narrow passages. As if century-old castles aren’t spooky enough in the first place.4. PrypiatThe last site is really different from all the rest and quite unusual. Not a specific ‘attraction’ but rather a whole town, Prypiat is an abandoned town, the one which is closest to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It has been uninhabited since 1986 when the Nuclear Disaster took place. Prypiat used to be home to the hundreds of workers and scientists that worked in the factory. However, due to the extremely high levels of radioactivity, all people were moved from the town.Nowadays, the levels of radioactivity have dropped significantly in comparison to 1986, and the place is basically safe to visit, but with a guide. Since I was on my own, I had to join a group of fellow travelers in order to be able to visit the radioactive ground. After the Chernobyl disaster, Prypiat was cleared of its inhabitants, everything was left intact and up to this day stays where it has been once left – household furniture, everyday items, even the nursery’s beds, and an amusement park’s bumper cars and Ferris wheel are still there. I felt like an intruder in some ghost town. The feeling of the place being haunted is extreme.So next time you feel adventurous, why not test your courage by visiting one of these, instead of climbing a mountain? If you have the guts, that is.You can read more from Grace at http://www.vacation-rentals.com/.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/6-amazing-must-see-places-2017/,6 Amazing Must See Places for 2017,Portugal,"“The gladdest moment in human life, me thinks, is a departure into unknown lands.” – Sir Richard BurtonSummer is almost upon us and for many, that means thinking about our yearly vacation. The budget airline revolution and strong US dollar have made it more affordable than ever to take that dream trip. So where should you go? Whether you’re a lay on the beach type or a cultural city explorer, this list has something for everyone. Here are 7 excellent places to blow off steam in 2017:1. PortugalAlta Duoro PortugalThe oft-forgotten gem of Western Europe, Portugal has rebounded financially since the global recession. The capital, Lisbon, is in the midst of a gastronomic revolution, making the most of fabulous fresh fish and local products of the lush Mediterranean climate.Lisbon is a city of contrast, in which, the sublime black and white tilework clashes with red clay rooftops and the vibrant azure of the Rio Tejo delta.To the south, the stunning grottos of the Algarve are dotted with secretive beaches.In the North, you’ll find Porto at the mouth of the river Douro. The birthplace of Port wine and home to some the world’s best vintners. A Douro valley cruise is a must for true wine enthusiasts, and a delightful journey for all.Overall, Portugal has a ton to offer in a tiny compact (affordable) package.2. Croatian CoastCroatia Coast, photo from pixabay.comCroatia’s tourism industry is just before the fever pitch. With a little help from Game of Thrones, Westerners are finally flocking to the gem of the Adriatic. The picturesque castle of Dubrovnik (you may recognize it as King’s Landing), sits on crystal clear inlets and alcoves.Locals recommend an island hop from Korcula, to Brac, to party central Hvar, and finally to Pag, where you’ll find stellar artisanal cheese. On Pag, you’ll feel a world away from your troubles on the barren rocky surface often likened to the surface of the Moon. Nearby Zadar is famous for a majestic sunset Alfred Hitchcock once lauded as “the world’s most beautiful.” Roman ruins are ubiquitous and especially worthwhile in the Istrian city of Pula, which features one of Europe’s best preserved amphitheatres.Croatia is fully recovered from the tumultuous 90’s and ready to take you in, it’s best to take advantage before everyone else takes notice.3. DenmarkCanal boat in Copenhagen, photo from pixabay.comIn the capital, Copenhagen, you’ll find an eclectic mix of the contemporary and the classic. The architecture offers a delightful clash between the ancient sea foam rusted copper roofs and modern compositions, like the flowing Opera House. The exploding food scene, likewise, ebbs between traditional open faced sandwiches, and the truly experimental creations of nouveau culinary legends. Copenhagen is also home to Mikkeller Brewing, which constantly pumps out some outlandishly delicious craft brews.Furthermore, Denmark’s second city, Aarhus, is the European Capital of Culture for 2017. The often-ignored locale is home to Denmark’s largest university so there is no shortage of vibrant, innovative culture, and nightlife.The typically Scandinavian architecture along the quaint riverfront is, in itself enough to merit a visit. The Danes speak excellent English and are very open to explaining their unique lifestyle.4. AustraliaSydney Opera House, photo from pixabay.comAustralia is a tried and true destination. The pristine beaches, world class surf, and fantastic cities have been attracting tourists for decades. So why now? The Australian Dollar has cratered making a traditionally expensive destination affordable for the rest of the world. Furthermore, global warming and pollution continue to threaten the gargantuan Great Barrier Reef with extinction. Close to ⅔ of the reef is in danger of deadly “bleaching”, so there’s no time like the present. Budget airlines and economic trends make now the time to visit the land down under.5. CanadaBow Lake – Banff National Park, photo from pixabay.comCanada is celebrating a big birthday this year. 2017 marks the nation’s 150th year, and gives you a reason to visit the second biggest country in the world. From Vancouver in the West to Prince Edward Island in the East, Canada consistently delivers beautiful natural wonders. Alberta’s Banff National Park is well worth a visit.The cultural capital of Toronto is a cosmopolitan metropolis with a completely idyllic mixture of people from all over the planet. The contrasting Montreal is an enclave of a singular Quebecois mind-set, where you can find francophone food and a proud local heritage. Likewise, the languishing Canadian Dollar makes it a great time to join in the birthday party.6. ColombiaSalento Colombia, photo from pixabay.comBest known in the 90’s for a slew of cocaine fuelled violence, Colombia has calmed down in recent years. Growing interest in the drug kingpins, spurred by numerous documentaries and Netflix’s Narcos, has made the interior cities of Bogota, Medellin tourist attractions. It’s finally safe to visit their exquisite rolling hills.Former rival Cali, is the jewel of the pacific coast, and Cartegena is the capital of the post Columbian Caribbean. A rising star is the oldest inhabited colonial city of Santa Marta where you can see history in motion. Colombian cuisine and culture is in the midst of a velvet revolution and it could be cool to see a small part of it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/island-running-routes/,7 Exotic Island Running Routes,Reunion,"The #runitfast hashtag has now hit 1.2 million posts on Instagram, so fitness expert Erny Peibst has mapped out running routes for all levels on some roads less travelled. Get away from it all and have a well deserved break, immersing yourself in the beautiful scenery and culture these islands have to offer.From mountain peaks to sandy beaches our planet has some incredible landscapes to explore, so pack your bags and get ready to test your endurance on these exotic islands.1. Running Route on Kauai, HawaiiKnown as the ‘Garden Island’ for its lush vegetation and steady rainfall, running on Kauai gives you an unbelievable opportunity to take in some stunning views of nature.Not only is there remarkable scenery, but along the coast, Kauai is home to white-sand beaches that stretch out into the clear turquoise water of the North Pacific Ocean.Tourists usually stick to the north of the Island, staying in places like Princeville so we’ve mapped out a route that will get you away from the busy tourist traps and allows you to take in all the treasures Kauai has to offer.The route will take you on a scenic 4-mile run along ‘The Coconut Coast’ from Wailua to Kealia. The flat, red clay path stretches along coastal cliffs giving you stunning views of the Pacific on one side and of the island’s vegetation on the other. As you take a leisurely run along the track, you may even catch a glimpse of dolphins or whales in the waters below.2. Running Route on Réunion, near MadagascarThis tiny island off the coast of Madagascar is no bigger than Dorset but rises more than 10,000 ft above the ocean and is the perfect place for any dedicated runner to test their abilities.Home to a truly untouched wilderness, the island was formed from 2 volcanoes (one of which is still active) that have created a heart-stopping natural beauty in the middle of the Indian ocean.The route mapped out starts at the small island village, Piton Sainte-Rose. The coastal town has incredible views and is the perfect place to catch the sunrise if you want to start your run early.The run totals 6.8 miles testing you on a range of terrain and revealing some breathtaking views along the way, not only of the Indian Ocean but then turning inland to the dense island vegetation.About three-quarters of the way around you will also come across an unexpected treasure in the form of Anse Waterfalls. A stunning natural waterfall that climbs 15m high with a crystal clear pool at the bottom – the perfect place for you to stop and catch your breath.*The waterfall is not on the trail and requires a slight detour. When you start to hear the sound of spraying water you will see a signpost for the waterfall with a small track that leads off the trail, take a short jog up and you will be blown away by this natural wonder.Photo by James Donaldson on Unsplash3. Running Route on Palaui, PhilippinesMade up of over 7,000 islands, you could spend months enjoying all of the remote and wondrous running trails the Philippines has to offer.If you only have a short amount of time for your trip then the one place you definitely need to go is Palaui. Located on the northeast tip of Luzon, the island is home to the nation’s capital and an international airport, it is incredibly easy to get to and well worth the 14-hour bus ride.The island is tiny but is home to an almost 6-mile trail called The Lagunzad Trail. The terrain is moderately difficult with some steep climbs up and down mountain peaks but the stunning scenery you get to take in along the route makes those burning climbs well worth it.The island was declared a National Marine Reserve in 1994 and gives you the opportunity to explore many untouched sites from white sand beaches and hidden waterfalls to clifftop views of the Philippine Sea – everything you could want from a running holiday this island has to offer.4. Running Route on Santorini, GreeceOne of the longest and most talked about trails on Santorini goes from Fira to Oia; it’s a steady descent for the entire trail but nothing even an amateur runner couldn’t handle.This is a great trail and really gives you a true taste of the Aegean experience. Starting at a picturesque port in Fira, it continues around the rim of the caldera to Oia on the southern tip of the island, passing through historic sights and Greek towns on the way.The trail takes you along spectacular cliff-tops giving you a stunning view of the sparkling blue Aegean sea that stretches for miles ahead.5. Running Route on Corsica, FranceThe French island of Corsica is home to one of the world’s most spectacular trails, the GR 20 that stretches across 111 miles.The trail winds its way along the jagged center of Corsica’s mountain range. Despite the rugged and mountainous terrain, the trail is within the capabilities of most runners.Your starting point is in Calenzana and the trail goes all the way down to Conca but the section mapped out is just 16 miles and ends in Haut-Asco. This northern part of the trail is great if you just want to go for a run rather than spend days trekking the length of the Island.The entire trail is incredibly well marked with red and white blazes so there is no chance of you getting lost as you run through the breathtaking scenery.6. Running Route on DominicaIf you’ve ever wanted to explore the jungle then Dominica is the place to go for your next ‘runcation.’ No poisonous snakes, no scary spiders, Dominica has some of the friendliest jungle in the world and the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail runs through it all.Segment four of the trail stretches from Wotten Waven to Pont Casse and is a great place to get in your run.The trail is shadowed on either side by an abundance of towering trees, buttress roots and dangling vines. One of the most spectacular waterfalls on the Island, Middleham Falls, is on this segment of the trail, the perfect place to stop and catch your breath or cool off and go for a swim.The terrain is moderately difficult, regular rainfall means you might sometimes find yourself slipping and sliding down hills and the jungle landscape means you will have to watch out for tree roots and branches ready to trip you up as you go.*There is a US$12.00 fee for a day pass to get on the trail.7. Running Route at Grace Bay, Turks, and CaicosIf the jungle isn’t really your thing and you’d rather be running across white sand beaches at sunset then Turks and Caicos is probably the island for you.Home to some of the clearest waters and softest white sand beaches you’re ever likely to find, Grace Bay beach is the crown jewel of the Caribbean.As you run along the beach looking out at the ocean, just a mile offshore you can see the protected reefs through the crystal clear water. The beach itself is always pristine (no rocks, seaweed or pollution in sight) and has been named the most breathtaking destination on the globe.Share this: "

https://amateurtraveler.com/7-things-you-should-know-before-traveling-to-romania/,7 Things You Should Know Before Traveling to Romania,Romania,"This week’s Amateur Traveler podcast was about traveling in Transylvania in Romania. What should you know if you go to Romania?Transylvania in Romania – Amateur Traveler Episode 161Dracula – Dracula was a real person, not a vampire. Vlad III Dracula was a ruler in Romania in the 1400s after whom Bram Stoker patterned his character Dracula. Although we should point out that you don’t get the nickname “Vlad the Impaler” by being Mr. Nice Guy.The People’s House – Before former communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted from power in 1989 he built the second-largest building in the world (the largest being the pentagon outside Washington D.C.). Ceausescu had over 1/5th of Bucharest demolished to build The People’s House which now houses the parliament. The building survived Ceausescu who was deposed, tried and executed.Romania language – The Romania language is a romance language with ties to Latin as this region was part of the ancient roman empire.Hello.”Salut.” (sah-LOOT)Excuse me. (Getting attention)”Pardon” (pahr-DOHN)Romania Population – Romania is shrinking. No not the country, the population. With a fertility rate of 1.38 children born for every woman, Romania like many other European nations is losing population.Romania History – Romania did not appear on the map until 1856. According to the CIA Factbook:The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia – for centuries under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire – secured their autonomy in 1856; they united in 1859 and a few years later adopted the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and acquired new territories – most notably Transylvania – following the conflict.Old Romanian Superstition – According to Unbelievable Facts – Strange Facts – Barmy Beliefs:In parts of Romania, they used to think it was dangerous for someone to sleep with his or her mouth open. They believed that the person’s soul, in the shape of a mouse, would run out of the open mouth and escape. If the mouse didn’t return, the sleeper could never wake up.Social Conventions – According to the World Travel Guide:Handshaking is the most common form of greeting, but Romanian men may kiss a woman’s hand when being introduced. Mr or Mrs should be used when greeting someone for the first time. Visitors should follow normal European courtesies on social occasions. Dress tends to be rather conservative but casual wear is suitable. Beachwear should not be worn away from the beach or poolside. If visiting a home, a small wrapped gift should be given to the host, such as flowers or chocolates (to women only), wine or liquor. Flowers should be given as a gift in odd numbers only. Many Romanians are smokers and gifts of Western cigarettes are greatly appreciated. Other well-appreciated gifts include toiletries. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-a-weak-american-in-russia-and-ukraine-by-walter-parchomenko/,Book Review: “A Weak American in Russia and Ukraine” by Walter Parchomenko,Russia,"The phrase “A Weak American in Russia and Ukraine” I thought was a joke.  How can anyone be weak traveling to Eastern Europe?  That’s not possible!  After reading these short stories by Walter Parchomenko of comical personal adventures, frightful current statistics and embarrassment reducing hints, I sadly concur that most Americans I know, including myself, may be classified as a weak and overly privileged American.Parchomenko’s memoir is an almost unbelievable, yet invaluable, painfully honest guide for those interested in navigating minefields, also known as cities, adjusting to the customs of copious vodka consumption, lending itself to alcoholism or how to maneuver the supermarket in foot candy stilettos.  He lends practical advice, wisdom and unabashedly laughable experiences that could be shared from any parent wanting to shield their child from being taken advantage of or travel agent attempting to protect themselves by informing the traveler to pack wisely because they really are going to visit a third world country.He has a writing sense of humor like Bill Bryson and gives Rick Steves a howling stray dog avoiding, sidewalk leaping, non water resistant “Slovak lightweight thatched shoes with countless tiny holes” jaunt for his rubles.  Reading of the “rootin-tootin, Poutin’s” and Ukraine’s culture of consistent stealing, cheating, bribing and poverty is appalling.  A government that requires one to bring their own medical supplies to the hospital blows my mind.  Living or traveling to these countries would certainly be an adjustment for the “average” American.  The statistics Parchomenko provided are current and astonishing.  94%, yes, 94% of Ukraine’s mortality in 2009 was related to alcohol, smoking and traffic accidents.  Turning down a cigarette with a friend is blasphemy and wearing a seatbelt is an insult to the Slavic Formula-1 drivers who think pedestrians are speed bumps.  He explains why one should treasure a loaf of bread, learn to enjoy Salo and accept gifts of food as a guest.  His true anecdotes about lack of hot water in the ticking time bomb apartments, common, yet appalling sex trade for a better life in America where “squat stalls” are a rarity, police corruption and atrocious government that values the World Cup more than their population growth is incredibly eye opening.This book, I dare say, was better than a travel guide on attractions to visit, where to dine and the public transportation system.  It is a survival guide.  It is a truthful account of why Slavs live in the moment, even though they are chronically tardy.  I know if I ate Borscht, my spoon would have kerplunked soup over the pages, countless times because of drollness and bleakness.  Reading a collection of travel anecdotes about living in a country that is not mine is a reminder that I am fortunate to live in America.  I have clean water available, a savings account and the option to say no to smokers.  I am curious how Russia won the bid for the 2014 Olympics.  I have speculations.  Those will be tales to read another day. Share this: "

While there are many great beach destinations in Africa, very few can rival the lure and charm of the Seychelles Islands. Located deep in the Indian ocean, north-east of Madagascar, the Seychelles archipelago is a group of over 100 small islands many of which have incredibly beautiful beaches, and should be your next goal if you enjoy beach luxury.Mahe IslandEven though the best beaches in the Seychelles are in Praslin Island, you should probably start your Seychelles vacation at the Mahe Island. First, because it is the commercial center of Seychelles, and second, because of the Beau Vallon. This magnificent beach will solve all your problems momentarily through its healing waves that sweep into the shoreline ever so gracefully.There is a lot for you to do and to see in Mahe, top of which include visiting the Botanical Gardens and thereafter the St. Anne’s Marine National Park. At the marine park you’ll easily get watery-eyed as you set your eyes on the beauty of the Sauzier Waterfall. At the center of the capital, Victoria, you will find the famous clock tower which has its twin at the Vauxhall Road Bridge in London. The tower was given as a gift in 1903 to symbolize the separation from Mauritius and the beginning of a new colony for Seychelles.Mahe offers you plenty of water sport activities chances, including snorkeling, deep-sea diving and deep-sea fishing. Most of the hotels and lodges in Mahe offer the necessary facilities needed, so you do not need to worry. If you love paragliding, you and your bravery are in luck, for there is an available option to do so in Mahe. But if you fear that you might get a heart attack if you go paragliding, you can just hire a helicopter to take you on scenic flight excursions over the islands.How about treating yourself to a souvenir with mystical sexual powers? The ‘coco de mar’ is one such souvenir. Owing to its shape that is similar to the female pelvis, is the subject of many legends, legends further enhanced by the fact fact that you can only find it the Seychelles. It is such an expensive nut that when you buy it, you receive a registration number that acts as authorization for its sale. A perfect gift.PraslinYour best chance for getting a coco de mar is in Praslin Island, which should be your next stop in the Seychelles. Other than just the ‘coco de mar’, Praslin hosts some of the most amazing beaches in the world, adding to the beautiful diversity in Seychelles. The beaches include Anse Lazio, Anse Georgette, Anse Kerlan and Anse Volbert, all of which stretch longer and wider than those at Mahe Island.Talking about special, how would you fancy a tour to where it all started? Valle de Mai is thought to have been the Garden of Eden where Adam set the trail for all men by falling prey to the forbidden fruit. The moment you set your eyes on this splendid nature reserve, any doubts you may have about this myth will take a back seat. It’s open to tourists and is an absolute must-see. Its well laid out paths lead you on a Seychelles discovery tour that you will never forget. A peek at one of the world’s rarest birds, the Seychelles Black Parrot, will be one of the highlights, though not the only one, for the ardent birdwatcher.La Digue islandFrom Praslin, you should next go to La Digue island, which is a mere 30 minute ferry ride from Praslin. As you land on this magical island, where the main forms of transport are still bicycle and ox-cart, you will experience a deja vu feeling of years gone by. For a completely serene vacation away from the hustle and bustle of civilization, this is definitely the dream destination.La Digue hosts one of the world’s most famous – and certainly most photographed beaches – Anse Source d’Argent. The Island also holds relics of another age, including a cemetery of the first settlers, a working calorifer (oven for refining coconut oil), giant tortoise pen and magnificent Creole mansion.Further away in the horizons, low corals ascend gradually into islands lands, churning up images from the scene in “Pirates of the Caribbean” where Jack Sparrow is stuck in an abandoned mystic island devoid of human life. Forget about the “abandoned” part, add elegant accommodation amid surroundings of breathtaking natural beauty and you have yourself the perfect hideaway island.Bird and Denis52 miles north of Mahé, you’ll find the glimmering world of the coral isles of Bird and Denis. In this lovely isles lies the opportunity for you to change careers to being a sailor. The safe mooring will keep you free of worry for your safety, with only the wind direction to worry about. Some charter companies even provide catamarans and Mono-hulls if you are interested.Other than sailing, the islands are home to the best snorkeling, fishing and diving conditions. The waters go as steep as 2km at the edge of the shallow banks, giving rise to a rich aquatic ecosystem. The waters here are crystal clear and are a beauty to the eyes. The sea bird colonies, silver surf, golden sands and nestling turtles will keep you busy the whole time.Normally, you wouldn’t consider giant tortoises as a common tourist attraction. But when you have 150, 000 of them, this becomes a topic of interest. Where else will you see this than in the Aldabra Atoll, yet another splendid Seychelles destination. The phenomenon is so marvelous that it has earned the Aldabra Atoll a UNESCO World Heritage Site status.With a cocktail in one hand and lots of adventure simmering inside of you, enjoy Seychelles as much as you can since there’s nothing like Seychelles.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/scandinavia-travel-for-first-timers-what-to-expect/,Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect,Sweden,"Scandinavia Travel for First-Timers: What to Expect?Scandinavian countries stand among the most perfect destinations for a getaway as they combine all you need for a wonderful vacation: picturesque landscapes, cutting-edge cities, outstanding cuisine and adventurous spirit. If you’ve already made up your mind to explore the motherland of Vikings for the first time, you should know a couple of facts about this marvelous region to avoid some pitfalls and make your Scandinavia travel even more pleasant and memorable.No money, no honeyThe first thing that’s impossible not to mention is that this Nordic region may astound or even shock some visitors with its, at times, skyrocketing prices. Norway, in particular, is the most expensive country in the world with average salaries of 4665 euros per month, so it’s not that hard to imagine that the prices there – and in Scandinavia on the whole – can bite. Good news: there are some ways to save money and travel around Northern Europe without breaking the bank. You can cut back on your costs by joining a pre-planned small group tour, buying multi-day transport tickets instead of single fares, saving on accommodation by choosing to stay at hostels or simply by getting food in local supermarkets instead of dining in posh restaurants. In any case, Scandinavia is not a budget destination, so it’s better to plan the trip carefully and keep an eye on your spending in order not to squander all your money during the first two days.One more fact about money is that Scandinavia is becoming more and more cashless, thus the most convenient and wise payment method is by card.Unpredictable WeatherMost people believe that Scandinavian climate tends to be cold and severe, but that’s not entirely true. Everything depends on the season and region you’re going to explore. If you’re planning a summer trip, you may be pleasantly surprised by mild and warm weather with temperatures of 21-23°С during the day in the southern regions, and by the shiny midnight sun during the night in the north. Polar day is a usual phenomenon in northern Norway and Sweden as some parts of these countries are located beyond the Arctic Circle, meaning the sun doesn’t go down the horizon in the summer months and can be seen 24 hours a day.Winters are also not that severe in the majority of Scandinavian capitals. For instance, the average winter temperatures in Oslo and Copenhagen are only about -3/-5°С due to the proximity to the Gulf Stream. However, if you want to fulfill your dream-come-true to visit the Santa Claus residence in Lapland, stock up with warm sweaters as you’ll have to travel in the frosty conditions of -15/-17°С.Unexpected Masterpieces and Hidden GemsScandinavia is not only about natural marvels like breathtaking fjords, tiny islands and frozen lakes. The region boasts fascinating cities and lovely villages that have their own special charms. Green parks of urban Helsinki, Hans Christian Andersen’s heritage in Danish Odense, the majestic Stockholm Royal Palace, numerous museums of Oslo… there’s no end to Scandinavian attractions that are worth visiting. But it’s sure that you’ll come across even more hidden gems than you expected to see. The brilliant example of Scandinavian creativity and love to beauty is the Stockholm subway. It’s considered to be the world’s longest art exhibition as 90 of the 100 stations are decorated with fantastic paintings, sculptures, and mosaics, created by more than 150 artists.Scandinavian cities also have a dense impressive collection of street art. There are even tours on the urban murals that are sometimes painted on the facades of buildings in the city centers. Some of them have deep meaning, some are painted just for fun. Anyway, Scandinavians just love to turn boring structures into real masterpieces.Scandinavian Design and Decor – MinimalismComing to Scandinavia, you can’t help but notice the free and easy spirit of the Viking descendants. The main trend of living is minimalism which pervades every aspect of everyday life: from the clothing they wear to how they decorate their homes to their attitudes toward food.The inventors of Ikea and H&M, Scandinavians do their best to simplify their lives. It’s unlikely that you’ll come across lots of people wearing sophisticated colorful clothes for the reason that Nordic people put comfort above all. They mainly give preference to basic clothes and comfortable shoes but combine them in the way to look trendy and cool.The same simplicity can be seen in Scandinavian decor. The typical interior uses light pastel colors diluted with bright accents. They also keep a strong relationship with the elements and nature. Passionate about the idea of harmony and eco-friendliness, Scandinavians employ lots of wooden items in their homes: from furniture to floors and windows.As for the way of cooking, you’ll be surprised about how delicious simple meals can be. Nordic cuisine boasts an impressive variety of dishes based on fresh organic products. So visiting this region offers a perfect opportunity to savor the taste of healthy foods prepared in the best traditions of local chefs.Cycling – Scandinavian CbsessionThe people of the European North are true nature lovers and put much effort into the protection of the environment. Traveling around the cities, you’ll witness the huge number of cyclists and that’s not a coincidence. The most ‘cycling’ Scandinavian capital is Copenhagen where you can borrow a bicycle for any period of time absolutely for free. Moreover, the citizens ride bikes in any weather conditions, even in winter. The main arguments in favor of bikes are the reduction of emissions in the atmosphere, mobility and health benefits.Scandinavians also practice a responsible approach to waste processing. For a couple of decades, citizens have been accustomed to sorting garbage: almost near every house there are containers for paper, glass, metal, plastic, food and unrecoverable waste which helps these countries to remain in the top of the most ecologically sound countries in the world.All in all, Scandinavia offers a number of attractions and features to fall in love with. No doubt that the trip to this spectacular region will leave lots of lovely memories and impressions that eventually can become the reason to come back, maybe more than once. This article is a sponsored by firebirdtours.com.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/stockholm-on-a-budget/,Stockholm on a Budget – Save Money on a Trip to Sweden,Sweden,"Riksdag, the Swedish equivalent of the Houses of ParliamentScattered across 14 islands and surrounded by water and lush, green spaces, Stockholm is stylish and beautiful – but notoriously expensive.For travelers on a budget it can present quite a challenge, but if you scratch beneath the surface you’ll find plenty of reasonably-priced restaurants and hotels in Stockholm and lots of free or cheap things to do.Go swimming at the city’s beachesStockholm has two city beaches where you can go swimming: Långholmsbadet and Smedsuddsbadet.Both offer sandy shorelines and good swimming but get heaving during the summer when the sun’s shining. In the winter, there are far fewer souls around who are prepared to brave the cold.Look around Stockholm’s free museumsSome of the city’s museums offer free entry at certain times. Tourist information will be able to give you complete details, but for example, the Moderna Museet (modern art) and Arkitekturmuseet (architectural exhibits), both housed in the same building, offer free entry on Fridays from 4-6 pm.Explore leafy DjurgårdenDjurgården BridgeNearly a third of the city is made up of waterways, and almost another third of parks and other green spaces, making it a very pleasant place to spend a few days.Of the many bridges you’ll cross during your trip to Stockholm, look out for the Djurgården Bridge connecting mainland Östermalm to the island of Djurgården.Once the royal game park, today the island is full of attractions: historical buildings, yachting harbors, museums, and the Gröna Lund amusement park and Skansen open-air museum. And while you have to pay for most attractions, you could easily while away a few hours enjoying the lush parkland or picnicking under the trees.Take a free tour of the RiksdagFree, hour-long tours of the Riksdag (the Swedish equivalent of the Houses of Parliament) are available in English four times a day on weekdays over the summer, or on Saturdays and Sundays in winter. Call ahead (00 468 786 48 62) to book a place.Witness the Changing of the GuardModerna Museet, StockholmStroll over to the Royal Palace, the seat of Sweden’s monarchy, to witness the Changing of the Guard – a ceremony that packs a great deal of pomp and circumstance into its 40 minutes.During the summer this ceremony takes place daily, but in winter you’ll need to time your visit for a Wednesday, Saturday or Sunday.Follow the National Geographic Traveler’s tour of the Old TownThe narrow streets of the Old Town open out into attractive courtyards and pass by lots of interesting buildings, but you could easily miss out on some of the best if you don’t have a plan. Rather than paying to join an organized guided tour (of which there are several on offer), you could download the free National Geographic’s Stockholm Walking Tour map along with a description of what you’re seeing en route.Rebecca (but not Amateur Traveler) did receive compensation from Octopus Travel to write this post.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/singapore-favorite-city/,Singapore – Favorite City,Singapore,"My wife and I went on a trip of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore and I wanted to write about Singapore. I was delighted to be in that city as it is an archetype of my concept of “Modern Asia”. This was more evident specially after spending 1 week in Thailand which is very underdeveloped.Before speaking of how nice the city is, let me tell you that I was surprise to know how it came to be. In all my years at school I always learned of countries being either independent or becoming independent but never being “expelled”. And this is what happen to Singapore, as it was part of Malaysia but since the number of citizens of Chinese origin was more than the citizens of Malaysian origin, the Malaysian government decided that they didn’t wanted the province to be part of Malaysia and “cut” it of the country.Interdit!Originally uploaded by magna_maximaWell, the first thing you notice is all the signs about what is forbidden, when we got into a bus shuttle to go into the airport the first first thing was a big sing asking you to use your belt or getting a 500$ fine! But you are inside a bus! I have never ever seen this before. Then after spending some time there you see how these kind of signs speaking about fines are EVERYWHERE and this has an impact on culture, for example there is a “Chinatown” in Singapore (which is more like an old town) happens to be the most clean china town I ever been, literally spotless.The second thing you will notice, is that the city is in reality 3 parallel universes coexisting, the first is modern Singapore, the second is the Indian community and the third the traditional Chinese. Everyone is well educated and bilingual and you can’t stop to feel you are in an artsy American film of someone going to Asia and everyone speaking English with a different accent. For all of the above, I recommend going to Singapore. Don’t forget to book your hotel accommodation online on sites like Expedia, to get the best deals.This is an entry for January’s Your Favorite City – Blog Contest.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/what-to-do-in-slovenia/,What to do in Slovenia,Slovenia,"There are moments when you are exploring a new destination that you think, “why didn’t anyone tell me about this place before?” For Slovenia, I had that moment while exploring the Škocjan caves which is a UNESCO site. We had just come out of the Silent Cave and were entering into the Murmuring Cave, one of the largest known underground river canyons in the world. I knew at that moment that more people should come to Slovenia.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Where is Slovenia?ItineraryLjubljanaIdrija (UNESCO)Franja Partisan HospitalPredjama CastlePostojna CaveŠkocjan Caves (UNESCO)LipicaPiranKamnik and the Velika PlaninaLake BledDriving in SloveniaPodcastConclusion            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/Slovenia.kmz"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(8);    });  }Where is Slovenia?Don’t be too embarrassed if you aren’t sure where Slovenia is. Slovenians told me that sometimes Italians aren’t sure… and they are the country next door. Slovenia was a part of the former Yugoslavia and before that the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is neighbored by Italy, Croatia, Austria, and Hungary. It is smaller than all but the 3 tiniest states of the United States: Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island.Slovenia has been in the European Union since 2004 and uses the euro as its currency.ItineraryLjubljanaI flew into the airport in Ljubljana which is the main airport in the country. It is located about 20 minutes outside of the city.Ljubljana is a beautiful city, although my visit was in April which has changeable weather. The weather the week before and the week after my trip was sunny but I saw much of Slovenia in between rainstorms. I took a walking tour of the city and my guide said that the city streets fill up with locals when the sun is out but the city hibernates on rainy days.A major earthquake in the 1500s destroyed much of the downtown. When it was rebuilt much of it was rebuilt in the baroque style. As the city expanded in the 1920s much of the new construction was in the style of Art Nouveaux.In the city’s medieval core, you can still see traces of a city history that goes back at least to the time of the Roman Empire. When you stand by the marker dedicated to the brief rule by Napoleon, note the curved houses of the buildings across the street that still retain the shape of the Roman hippodrome. At one end of Congress Park, there is a Roman sarcophagus that was found nearby.The river Ljubljana cuts through the city and one of its most famous sights is the Triple Bridge design by architect Jože Plečnik.While you are in the Old town, you can also check out the large daily market and the city’s baroque cathedral.The trails or the funicular up to the castle for the best views of the city. In the summer, arrive earlier in the day or walk up to avoid the long lines at the funicular. Even on a rainy day, the tower of the castle is worth the climb for views of the city.Idrija (UNESCO)There are 13,000 caves in Slovenia and I was told in the mining town of Idrija that when Slovenians don’t find a hole in the ground they will dig one. Idrija was a center of mercury mining.In 1490, a local tub maker found a very odd liquid metallic substance. When he took it to a goldsmith in nearby Loka he was told: “oh that’s not very valuable… but where did you say you found it.” But the substance was mercury which was important, among other reasons, because it was used in the extraction of gold in gold mining.It quickly made the town wealthy but according to a local story that came to the attention of the local ruler when the town loaned him a fairly large amount of money in exchange for the right to build a caste. Carl Archduke of Austria bought the mines in 1575 and they remained a major source of income for whatever country Slovenia was a part of until all Mercury it was closed in 1995. Slovenia joined the EU in 2004 where all mining, import, and exports and most uses of mercury have been banned.The city’s castle, Gewerkenegg castle, was owned by the mining company and now contains a great museum about the history of mercury mining in the area. Look for the exhibit that shows a steel ball floating in a bowl of mercury which demonstrates how heavy mercury is. If you get a chance, lift up a chunk of mercury ore, called cinnabar because of its red color. Because of the danger of breathing mercury vapors, it was this mercury ore that miners were looking for and they tried to avoid any liquid mercury deposits that they found. They burned the cinnabar to produce pure mercury. The life expectancy of a miner was only 40 years.https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Slovenia/Idrija/i-QX27xjG/0/9fb85c3b/640/IMG_6105-640.mp4You can also find a display about lace-making in the Gewerkenegg castle because while the men were down in the mine, the women were making lace. That handmade lace-making tradition continues in the city today.The mines in Idrija are part of a two-part UNESCO site showing the history of mercury mining along with Almaden in Spain which was the world’s largest mercury mine and dates back to Roman times.You can still tour the mine shafts of the old Antonijev Rov Tourist Mine. You don a hard hat and descend into the old mine with a guide. The earliest miners carved these tunnels slowly with a hammer and a chisel. As such, they dug as little as possible and worked on their knees in tunnels half the height of a man. Later tunnels were blasted with black powder and then dynamite before the final days of mining when pneumatic drills were introduced. I was glad for the hard hat as I had to duck the ceilings too low for my 6’3” frame and bounced my head off the rocks on the ceiling at least a dozen times. You do need to be able to climb about 300 steps to take this tour but it is worth it if you are able.While exposure to mercury was definitely going to kill you, the miners did not have the same risks of explosions from natural gas pockets that coal miners would have. They did still have a risk of flooding and of fire. On one occasion a large fire was started by a lantern that caught the timbers of the mine of fire. The only way to put out the fire was to divert a nearby river into the mine. That shut the mine down for half a year.While in Idrija look for two churches, or rather one church and one missing church. The town’s main church dedicated was dedicated to a patron saint of miner’s St Barbara. The uniforms of the mining company band and the tour guide’s today both have 23 buttons in commemoration of St Barbara’s martyrdom at the age of 23. But St Barbara’s church was destroyed in a British bombing raid in WWII and was not rebuilt under communist Yugoslavia. High above the town, you can see the small church dedicated to St Anthony of Padua who is a patron saint of miners and single people.Franja Partisan HospitalSlovenia, like the rest of the former country of Yugoslavia, is proud of its ability to liberate itself from German occupation at the end of WWII. That historic fact also gave Yugoslavia more independence in the post-war years from either the east or the west in the Cold War. While it was a communist country, it charted an independent course from the U.S.S.R. under its leader Tito.Because it had such a large number of partisans fighting for its freedom, it also had an unusual network of secret hospitals that treated the wounded. You can still visit one of those which is the Franja Partisan Hospital.Franja Partisan Hospital was located in a remote gorge and even today getting there is half the fun. Be glad that you aren’t carrying a litter with a wounded soldier up the gorge as the litter bearers had to do. To preserve the secrecy of the hospital they also only carried in the wounded at night and blindfolded them, friend and foe alike. They even spun them around a few times to disorient them.Even if you are not s history fan, if you are physically fit-ish then you will enjoy the adventure of the hike from the small parking lot up the gorge. The trail is well interpreted with signs in English and Slovene. The signs will point out where some of the defenses such as bunkers up the sides of the cliffs.What surprised me was that when I finally reached the hospital I found comfortable cabins and even X-ray equipment and an electric generator. All the materials to build the hospital were lower from the side of the gorge. The hospital was attacked twice by the Germans and was abandoned for a time in 1944. Many of the original cabins were destroyed in a flood in 2007 but were reconstructed. The hospital was able to save all but 78 of the roughly 500 patients that they received.Predjama CastlePredjama Castle may not be the most historically significant castle but it is one of the most photogenic as it is built into the mouth of a cave on the side of a cliff. It is most well-known for its previous owner Erasmus of Lueg who was a robber baron, Robin Hood-like character.When he killed one of the king’s favorite nobles he retreated to Predjama Castle where he held out against a siege. What the besieging soldiers did not know was that Erasmus had a secret entrance out through the back of the cave. So while they were hoping to starve him out, he would pelt them with fresh fruit and vegetables.He was eventually betrayed by one of his own men who lit a candle do identify when Erasmus was in the privy which allowed the besiegers to target him with artillery and kill him in this thinly walled portion of the castle.Erasmus is buried beneath a plane tree at the small church near the castle.The castle has some cozy living areas and some less cozy areas like a torture chamber.Postojna CavePostojna Cave is the easier to visit of the two caves that I saw in Slovenia. The cave has been welcoming tourists including kings, queens, and presidents since 1818. The cave was equipped with a train system back in 1872. The cave was lit with electric lights in 1884, before Ljubljana.It currently features an electric train that takes you 15 minutes under the mountain at the start of your tour. Visitors with mobility issues can opt to just take the train in and out for a 30 minute round trip, but most visitors will then do an hour-long walking tour of the caverns, stalactites, and stalagmites of Postojna Cave. The cave is a constant temperature of 10 °C year-round.https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Slovenia/Postojna-Cave/i-CQwTBDk/0/d7f9a45c/640/IMG_6150-640.mp4Photography in the dim light of the cave is challenging so I feel like my photos don’t do justice to the beautiful interior of the cave. Flash photos are not permitted as they encourage the growth of funguses that can destroy the fragile formations. The formations only grow at a rate of around 1 mm a year so the large formations are hundreds of thousands of years old.Škocjan Caves (UNESCO)To be honest, I did not want to enjoy the Škocjan Caves. The park does not allow photography inside which annoyed me. Unlike the train ride in the Postojna Cave, Škocjan will require you to climb 500 stairs up and down.You start with a 10-minute walk from the visitor’s center down to the entrance of the Silent Cave. The Silent Cave was discovered much later than the main cavern. It is a “dry” cave, which is to say it does not have a river running through it as the Murmuring Cave does. Compared to Postojna Cave its stalactites and stalagmites are not quite as spectacular, so right around this part of our tour, I thought I would be recommending to skip Škocjan Caves.The moment when we left the Silent Cave and got to where we could see the underground Reka River gorge is when my recommendation went from you can skip this, to this is the highlight of my trip.I am not surprised to feel some claustrophobia when visiting a cave but it was the first time that I have ever felt acrophobia. We were suddenly high up the wall of a misty river gorge lit here and there by lights along the path which clung to the other side of the canyon. Further up the cave wall, you could see the “oh hell no” path that the original tourists took which clings even more tenuously to the side of the chasm. We crossed to the other side on a bridge high above the river.I would not be the first to say that I suddenly thought I had been transported to the Mines of Moria in Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings.There are fewer stalactites and stalagmites in this portion of the caverns because when the river swells from heavy rain the entire chamber can fill with water, covering or even washing away the paths and bridges.The cave exit is one of a couple of large sinkholes where the cave ceiling collapsed, Pictures are allowed in that area and even just that area is stunningly beautiful. There is a funicular that you can take partway back to the visitor’s center.LipicaIf you are a lover of horses you have heard of Lipica even if you don’t realize it. Or at least you have probably heard of the famous Lipizzaner horses that are named for this small village. For centuries this was the center for breeding and training the horses for the Austria-Hungarian court, but when the country was broken up after WWI the herd was split between Vienna, Slovakia, and Slovenia.Because the total number of Lipizzaner horses is small, they are bred with great care. Every stallion has a sign above his stall that shows his registration number and the 1st initial from its sire’s bloodline, followed by the name of its dam. There are 4 main bloodlines for Lipizzanerhttps://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Slovenia/Lipica/i-VHL9FLL/0/95c0611b/640/IMG_6176-640.mp4You can still see these mostly white horses (technically grey horses with white hair) being put through their paces in an indoor arena.You can also go riding but their riding program is targeted towards experienced riders. My one ride in Lana’i did not really qualify me. They do offer Shetland pony rides for the kids in the summer.PiranSlovenia has a small slice of coast at Piran on the Adriatic coast between Trieste Italy and Croatia. But what it lacks in quantity Slovenia makes up for in quality. Piran is a lovely old Venetian city which has a church on the hill and old town walls.April was a great time of year to visit much of Slovenia to avoid crowds and that was especially true in Piran and Lake Bled that get a disproportionate amount of Slovenian tourism. The city’s old town square was quiet. You can easily circumnavigate the entire old town in around 20 minutes but it seems to me to be a better place to linger than my whirlwind itinerary allowed for.While you are in Piran one unusual ancient tradition that continues is the harvesting of salt from nearby Sečovlje salt ponds. You can tour the salt ponds and a small museum about the production of salt. Even if you don’t appreciate the historic significance of salt, the area is rich in waterfowl that are attracted to the marshy surroundings. Back in the day, many families would move out from the town to huts by the salt ponds for the summer to tend their white gold.A newer industry that you can tour just offshore near the salt ponds is the Fonda fish farm. This family-run company is looking to change the understanding of sustainable fishing by producing a tasty alternative to importing fish from halfway around the world. Visitors can visit by boat or kayak or can even take cooking classes at Fonda. I did try the fish but did not have time to visit the farm on my trip.Kamnik and the Velika PlaninaMy trip headed me back towards Ljubljana to the well known Lake Bled but on the way I made a visit to the high alpine pastures of Velika Planina.Near the city of Kamnik, some of the cow herders still take their cattle to the high alpine pastures in the summer just like the movie and book Heidi (kids google it). But these days they are joined by tourists who take a cable car ride up to the pastures to stay in huts fancier than those traditionally used by herdsmen.Slovenians love to hike. That’s a good thing because the western part of the country is hills, valleys, and mountains. From the locals that I talked to it seemed common that a baby would be taken on their first hike long before they take their first step.My trip to Velika Planina was on a foggy day after a late snow when the sun made only occasional appearances and I could only get glimpses of the nearby snow-capped mountains. I took the gondola with a guide up the mountain where we hopped on a chairlift that runs in winter for skiers and the rest of the year for hikers.We hiked to a small museum dedicated to the mountain herdsman that shows the traditional hut and what life was like on the mountain. The hut has a small inner hut for the herdsman and an outer ring of a stable for maybe a dozen cows. The cows are, in essence, part of the insulation for the hut.You might still be able to stop at a hut of a local herdsman and buy the signature hard cheese that they traditionally made with the summer milk.Lake BledLake Bled may be the best known of the Slovenian tourism spots. Tourism in the area was bootstrapped by natural healer Arnold Rikli who started a health spa in the area in 1854.The most famous spot in Lake Bled is the island church of the Assumption of Mary Pilgrimage in the middle of the lake. You can take a rowboat out to the island or a ferry. If you bring your bride you are supposed to get good luck (or maybe just chiropractor bills) by carrying her up the stairs to the church. Visitors also ring the bell in the church for good luck.https://photos.smugmug.com/Europe/Slovenia/Lake-Bled/i-PSd66nC/0/2a1b0ea7/1280/LakeBled-1280.mp4Climb to the top of the bell tower for the best views. I am not going to say that Lake Bled has the best views in Slovenia, but the former leader Tivo had a mansion on the lake just opposite the island. His mansion has now been turned into an upscale hotel, the Vila Bled.Take time to visit the castle on the mountain overlooking the lake. Bled Castle has a small museum that is worth a visit, a restaurant, and a small souvenir shops that have some nice local craftwork, but the best reason to visit is the spectacular views of the lake.You can watch a crew boat race along the lake, which is popular on Lake Bled.In the summer you can swim in the lake, but it is a bit too cold for that still when I was there in April.Driving in SloveniaDriving between all the spots I listed is easy in a rental car. The two furthest sites are probably 2 hours apart and most are less than that.Driving in Slovenia can be slow at times because there are few straight roads in the western half of the country because of the hills. But driving is not at all challenging. Slovenia uses the same sort of universal road signs you would expect to see elsewhere in the EU. Like in the rest of Europe most rental cars will be a standard transmission and you will need to reserve and pay more for an automatic transmission.PodcastHear more about my trip to Slovenia on Travel to Slovenia – Amateur Traveler Episode 656: ConclusionSlovenia is a beautiful green country with thousands of caves, snow-capped mountains and friendly people. Many Slovenians, especially younger ones, speak fluent English so it is an easy country for English speaking tourists. Check out this up and coming corner of Europe.Thanks to the Tourism Board of Slovenia for sponsoring my trip and working with me to narrow down where I would go on my week-long itinerary. The first pass at my itinerary had me going to the hometown of Melania Trump for a spa treatment. That might be something you would enjoy, but I loved the historic sites, UNESCO sites, and unusual sites that we ended up with instead. See all my Slovenia Photos. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/wine-and-ancestry-in-slovenia/,Wine and Ancestry in Slovenia,Slovenia,"Each page crackled as the village priest opened centuries old church birth records and my anticipation heightened when the page fell to my great grandfather’s name. The discovery of a hand written family tree led me to this “old country” village of Metlika, Slovenia, Old Yugoslavia. Soon I would find the working vineyard where my great grandfather Martin Jakljevic emigrated from in the late 1880’s to start a new life in America.Bela KrajinaVineyards, wine making and sheep breeding are the heart of the Bela Krajina region, a mere 2 miles from the border of Croatia.  The annual wine festival, the Vinska Vigred is a celebration of the white and red wine harvest and I knew that was just the right time to visit.  My long lost relatives own a tourism B&B including farm to table foods and they anxiously awaited my visit.Growing up with the Yugoslavian relatives, we shared freshly home baked potica bread and discussions as to where the family truly originated from in Europe.  This expedition would be like Columbus being sent out by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella as far as my family was concerned.Envisioning dirt roads in a rural village, I was pleasantly surprised with the paved roads, big yellow directional signs and mini markets along the highway.  Being a member of the European Union has modernized this country that is slightly larger than the state of New Jersey.  The tourists have yet to find this sleeping gem of a gorgeous country.Through rolling green hills, chalet style homes with family gardens protected by little fences and a sunny Mediterranean climate, I arrived to my homeland. The Jakljevic family ran to greet me and grand papa age 80 through the youngest third cousin age 13 circled around me with very broken English giving me the warmest welcome.Immediately whisked away to the large patio overlooking a steep valley with sheep roaming and bales of hay tightly rolled up, a crisp tablecloth embroidered with the family crest was ceremoniously draped over the patio table.FamilyGlass carafes of red and white wines were proudly set on the table and refilled often as our conversations focused on the family lineage. I grazed on fresh lamb sausage, jagged chunks of cheese and hearty breads served from a decorative tray. The older relatives who were survivors of World War II and knew the days of war torn Yugoslavia ate their food down to the last morsel. Locals arrived to buy wines and peaking through the big wooden doors to the cold wine cellar, I knew as long as there was wine, there was conversation!In the afternoon, we all walked through the Metlika wine festival enjoying freshly baked breads and roasted meats while listening to native Slovenian musical groups performing on stage. Third cousin Katje played the accordion with enthusiasm on stage!The village priest awaited us and he gathered the old books of birth and baptism records from a back room.The names that I had heard of all my life unfolded right before me, great grandparents and great aunts and uncles all listed.  Later, walking through the local cemetery where my ancestors are buried I was impressed how the families had modernized each plot out of respect for the loved ones.HarvestThe visit went by quickly and the family invited me back in the fall to help with grape harvesting.  The harvest is a community event with each family helping pick grapes, playing the accordion and singing as the grapes in the village are gathered.Grand Papa pointed to the vineyards and exclaimed, “Martin, Martin!” The vineyards begun by Martin continue to prosper in many ways to this day.  I’ll be ready for the grape harvest with my wicker basket and helping grand papa pick from our century’s old vines happily singing along with the accordion music.Share this: "

These small bowls of soup noodles served with a sprinkle of the key ingredient (pig’s blood) has a rich history and cultural aspect attached to it. This dish was originally served from the boats of the huge canal network that Bangkok used to have, and thus the name. While having pig’s blood in their bowl of noodles may discourage some people, the blood gets cooked almost immediately. It comes in touch with the hot broth and gives the dish a unique creamy texture which you’ll only find in Bankok cuisine.While there are vendors selling boat noodles at almost every street corner of Bangkok, ‘Doy Kuay Teow Reua’ near Victory Monument is one of the best places which continues to serve this dish in its original form.2: Green Papaya Salad (Som Tam) – ThailandGreen Papaya Salad is an extremely flavorful and spicy salad made primarily with green papaya, Thai bird’s eye chili and shrimp paste. The dish originates from the North-eastern or Isan region of Thailand. However, you can find varieties of this dish all over Thailand.

This style of preparation makes it sugary. The salty one (xôi mặn) is comprised of rice, dried shrimp, green onion, and Chinese sausage stirred with oil and flavored with soy sauce.Explore rice in Vietnam and find out what it tastes like when various ingredients are is mixed with it. You will be surprised.5. Roll Cake (Bánh Cuốn) – VietnamJust like a sandwich in the west, Vietnamese like to get creative with whatever they put in rolls of food. This is evident in their popular roll cakes known as (Bánh cuốn). The rolls are made of thin slices of baked dough. There are two different styles of roll cake that you would come across in the streets. There are those filled primarily with pork meat known as (bánh cuốn nhân thịt) and those filled with steamed rice served with spicy fish sauce, bean sprouts and herbs known as “bánh ướt” (wet cake). They are normally sold on moving carts. If you spot one, hurry up and catch it before it gets away!6: Green Tea Salad (Laphet Thohk) – MyanmarAt the street side tea stalls of Myanmar, you’ll often find various salads that you can have with your tea. Among those, the unique and popular salad is the Laphet Thohk. It is a salad made with pickled tea leaves, peanuts, tomatoes, green chilies, lime juice, and different sauces. The end result is a very unique, tangy, spicy, saucy mixture, which you must try while you are in Myanmar.7: Chinese Style Barbeque – Yangon, MyanmarThe Chinese colonies of Myanmar play a huge part in its culture and history. So your journey to Yangon will be incomplete if you don’t pay a visit to the Chinatown of Yangon. The 19th street of Chinatown, which is popularly known as the Barbecue Street, is famous for its street food vendors selling Chinese-style barbecued goodies. Just grab a table, order whatever looks nice, have a beer and indulge in the action-packed environment.8: Pork/Chicken Adobo – PhilippinesThis may be the most popular dish of the Philippines, and you really need to try it while you’re there. Tender pieces of meat marinated in vinegar and soy sauce, this dish is easily available on the street side, and it is a great experience to have this famous dish in its homeland.9: Banana-Q – PhilippinesAll you sweet lovers must not miss the opportunity to taste this extremely popular evening snack of the locals of the Philippines. The dish is made with a local variety of banana called ‘Saba,’ which is coated in brown sugar, deep-fried and then skewered on a stick like a piece of barbecued meat. You can find this dish everywhere throughout the Philippines, especially during the evening time.10: Balut – PhilippinesThis might not be the most appetizing street food you can have while you’re in the Philippines, but it is almost certainly the most unique one. Balut is a developing duck embryo, still in its shell, boiled and eaten in one gulp. It is considered an aphrodisiac by the locals, and though not for the faint-hearted, still it is one of the most unique street food experiences you can have in the Philippines.That’s my list of awesome street foods to look for as you go about your adventure in Southeast Asia.

https://amateurtraveler.com/a-guide-to-bangkok/,A Guide to Bangkok,Thailand,"written by Thomas Barker & Cole Baratte from DealsPlus.For tourists and expats alike, Bangkok can be daunting city to be in. It is hot, smoggy, and full of traffic. Under its surface Bangkok is a thriving cosmopolitan city, with award winning cuisine, and ridiculously fun nightlife.Here is digestible list of the very best Bangkok has to offer.TransportationTrain linksSource: Bangkok.com by Hotels.comEverything in Bangkok centers around its transport links. Although the city is home to almost 8 million people it only has four main train lines, which are shown below:The BTS Skytrain (Sukhumvit line)This is Bangkok’s most used transport link. It runs along Sukhumvit road, which most locals consider to be the heart of Bangkok.The BTS Skytrain (Silom line)This runs through Silom Road, a popular area for restaurants and shopping, then across the Chao Phraya river in to Bangkok Yai, a major residential neighborhood.The MRT subwayThis line runs through the Ratchada and Rama IV areas of Bangkok, where most offices are located. The Airport LinkRuns from the city to the main hub airport SuvarnabhumiTaxisSource: Travel Happy via Colin Tsoi on FlickrTaxis in Bangkok are notoriously cheap and the city is full of taxis and TukTuks. Here is the best way to use these servicesBangkok taxisColors: Yellow and green, pink, light blue, and white with a red stripeThese taxis can be flagged anywhere in Bangkok. You should also insist on the driver running the meter and it is generally a bad idea to negotiate an off book price as you will always be paying a higher rate. It is important to note that the taximeters are often tampered with so pay close attention to the meter increments. These should be 3 – 5 THB per KM and 1.5 THB in standing traffic.UberUber is available in Bangkok and can be a cheaper and safer alternative to the public taxis around the city.GrabtaxiThis phone app works with the local taxi companies to provide a guaranteed meter run taxi. You pay a small surcharge of around a dollar per ride. A good alternative, as many flagged taxi drivers may not understand you or want to take you to your destination.TukTuksThese three-wheeled trikes are a fun and fast alternative to taxis, but expect to pay at least double the taxi rate. You must negotiate the cost before the journey starts.Motorbike taxisAlso known as soi taxis, these bikes will give you a ride on the back for about 10 baht per Km. The bikes typically wait at the end of a numbered soi adjacent to the main road at most train stations. Make sure the driver is wearing an orange vest with his ID displayed on his/her back.Where to staySource: AgodaGrand Centre Point Hotel Terminal 21Nearby: Asoke BTS station and Sukhumvit MRT stationAverage cost per night: 4,500 THB ($130 approx.)Here you will find a 5-star experience with minimalist feel and a rooftop infinity pool and spa for wonderful city views.

https://amateurtraveler.com/teenager-thailand-volunteer-traveler-adventure/,Teenager Thailand Volunteer Travel Adventure,Thailand,"I’ve trained my teenage traveler well. I’ve never been more certain. After 30-plus hours of airport and flying time, when the wheels of her plane touched down in Los Angeles, the first thing she did was text her mother.“Just landed safe!”Having just celebrated her 16th birthday, my daughter has done more traveling than many adults. What she’s gained from her travel experiences can’t be measured. The fact that she understands how lucky she is, comes together to make her the person – teenager – she is.It was during spring break, that she was offered the opportunity to go to Thailand with Adventures Cross-Country (ARCC) on a summer adventure that combined community service with some unique, amazing actually, travel opportunities. The preparations began almost immediately. From shots to physicals, to more shots, and prescriptions for antimalarials and “just in case” antibiotics. And then there was the last-minute decision to get dry shampoo. Not on the official list, but a must-have in her mind, along with hydrocortisone cream and the Ex-Officio bug-repelling hoodie she wore (and apparently slept in) the entire trip.I spent a great amount of time helping her get ready for the trip. Far more time and attention than I ever give myself when getting ready to travel. But after weeks of preparation, in what seemed like an instant she was on her way. In the time it took for her to send a quick goodbye text from LAX, she was gone and off the grid.What her group of a dozen teens did in Thailand during that first week of radio silence was exhausting and impressive.They spent their first and only night in Bangkok in a hotel. Less than 24 hours after landing, they squeezed in their first service project, teaching and volunteering in a local school, before hopping on a night train to Chiang Mai. From there they boarded open-air bus-like trucks and bumped their way along dirt roads for a couple of hours, leaving their comfort zones behind before reaching the Village Hill Tribe.It might have been the closest many of the kids have ever gotten to a ‘middle of nowhere type setting.’ Surrounded by rice paddies, the teenagers taught English and poured the cement floor of a library in the making. Their home away from home was a village classroom. Tables and chairs were pushed aside to clear floor space for the kids to sleep at night. There were bugs of the flying and crawling variety and the board in the classroom was the kind that actually still uses chalk. Though they didn’t see the inside of any actual homes, my daughter got the impression the groups’ accommodations were nice in comparison to some of the villagers that may or may not have had electricity.There were no flush toilets. Showers were accomplished by filling a bucket with a hose and dumping it over your head. There aren’t many folks, let alone teenagers, that can rough it in those conditions, do community service work that involves hard labor and most impressively, still be smiling at the end of the day. When my home phone rang about a week after she left, there were no complaints but the shower, in her words, “was the best thing that ever happened to me.”For two weeks, she traveled through Thailand with two college-aged leaders. As a group, they learned who was shy, who was happy and yes, even who tended to lean toward the grumpy side. They learned how to work together, whether it was lining up to pass buckets of wet, heavy concrete or navigating and actually sleeping on overnight trains. Somewhere along the line, they also figured out moving trains provided good reception for calls home. It was one of the few times during the trip the kids were allowed to have their cell phones. ARCC has a strict no cell phone policy. When the group met for the first time at Los Angeles International Airport, leaders collected all cell phones.Teenagers can get a bad rap. Granted sometimes, they deserve it, but in many instances, the reputation distorts the facts. Put teens in the right situation, in this case, remote sections of Thailand, and it becomes clear how impressive they actually are.Along with mastering new construction skills and teaching English to dozens of children, they spent two days working at an elephant sanctuary. Cooking breakfast takes on new meaning when it’s for a 30-plus-year-old elephant and it’s done outside over what would remind you of a large campfire. When an unexpected call came from a nearby farm, they spent a warm afternoon harvesting banana stalks to add to the elephants’ diets, then came back to the sanctuary and cooled off while giving the gentle giants a bath in the river. I never thought of elephants as the cute and cuddly type, but the hundreds of photographs my daughter came home with prove me wrong over and over again.Experiences like this can’t be gained by reading books or searching the internet. They’re learned by traveling and doing. My daughter learned about Mahouts, Thai people who dedicate their lives to caring for rescued elephants, by talking to them and working with them. She learned how to lay a cement floor without the luxury of any fancy equipment. All of the teenagers learned that people, themselves included, can do great things when they put their minds to it.As a group of American teenagers, I think the kids also benefited and learned from each other. They came from all over the United States; the East Coast, West Coast and in between. Some had traveled extensively with their families, some came from affluent households, others saved every penny for years to make the trip a reality. But regardless of where they came from, they all came back with a unique glimpse of Thailand, the people and the amazing animals who call it home.Understanding cultural differences goes a long way toward understanding each other and living with each other, in a world that seems to grow smaller every day. It seems like something that could come in handy for any teenager, or any adult for that matter.Dana received a media rate for her daughter’s Thailand adventure, but as always her thoughts and opinions are her own.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/thailand-perfect-detox-holiday/,Thailand – The Perfect Detox Holiday,Thailand,"Having spent the majority of my early adulthood overindulging on holidays with too much food, booze and sunshine, the idea of a healthy holiday – although an alien concept – certainly appeared to have its upsides. Ever since I’d left behind my early twenties, I had initiated a venture into healthier living, so it was only natural to combine this with a trip across the world.The concept of getting healthy whilst surrounded by the wondrous landscape of Thailand’s shimmering coastline seemed too good to be true, but the reality made me wonder why I hadn’t been doing this ever since I first stepped onto a Costa del Sol bound plane with my friends at the age of 16.A Holiday Health KickEvery year just as the last signs of Christmas fade into the blistering January winter, we are bombarded with adverts of tropical bliss, sunshine breaks and, of course, how to transform into a god or goddess of swimwear prowess in the months preceding such a trip. Once the spring begins to settle in and summer looks likely on its way, the nation flutters into diet mode, with the impending image of showcasing those extra pounds on the beach threatening our holiday bliss.This vicious diet cycle that many of us slip into pre-holiday definitely doesn’t match the excitement of a fast-approaching chance to relax, so why not alleviate the anxiety, and simply combine the two?The notion of turning your poolside cocktails and late-night tapas into exercise regimes and healthy eating might not seem like the ideal exchange, but there is certainly more to a detox holiday than meets the eye…Taking it Easy in ThailandWhen I first began looking into the detox break, Thailand shouted out to me as the ideal setting. Known to many as the spiritual mecca when it comes to healing, where better than Asia to search for a more mindful version of myself? I then went on to discover that 95% of the population of Thailand has a belief system rooted in Buddism, so it seemed like the perfect place to discover a calmer, happier and healthier me.Naturally, the landscape of Thailand has always seemed like paradise to me; natural white sandy beaches, jewel-like crystal clear sea waters, and lush green rainforests… an exotic dream.Thailand’s spa sanctuaries and detox resorts are spread across the country, and most can be easily reached via Bangkok, which is ideal if you want to start with some city sightseeing and cultural exploration. I booked my flights with Thomson and started my journey…Letting goThailand’s islands are, to the majority of us Brits, synonymous with revelry, full moon beach parties and all-round debauchery, that is, until, you discover the quieter side to these sandy shores….Koh Samui island is a cultural melting pot of grand villas, simple beachside shacks and luxurious hotels, and my destination, the Absolute Sanctuary. Boasting the ability to provide me with a “life-changing experience” that will “last me a lifetime” this Moroccan inspired boutique hotel sits nestled amongst lush green gardens and a tree-lined hillside, providing the ideal setting for two weeks of relaxation.The sanctuary offers a signature selection of Detox Programs, Rejuvenating Programs and Yoga Programs, so you can select the perfect solution for your quest for a happier and healthier you.Having selected the detox program, my stay began with a consultation with a therapist, who outlined three potential courses to choose from, the Ultimate Detox, the Living Foods Detox, and the Vegetarian Detox. Shying away from the daunting prospect of full fasting with the Ultimate Detox, I selected the Living Foods Detox, which would allow me to enjoy fresh fruit and vegetables whilst on the program.Visitors can choose to detox for three, five or seven days, and having traveled some six thousand miles from home, I opted for the latter, making the most of my two-week visit.An Opulent SettingFrom my very first steps into the hotel, I was impressed with its sumptuous design of Moroccan decor, its striking views across the Gulf of Thailand, and its warm and welcoming staff. Not knowing what to expect I had conjured up images of my tummy rumbling at the poolside, resisting the urge to run to the nearby town and scoff my face with Thai curry, but the hotel’s infectious serene atmosphere was not one I ever wanted to divert from.Having arrived in mid-August the island was coming to the end of its hottest season, with temperatures reaching 35 degrees Celsius during the day. The few warm rain storms didn’t succeed in dampening my spirits, actually feeling rather magical as I swam in the pool amidst the warm droplets. Be warned that visiting from September to November might dampen more than your holiday heart though, as it’s the island’s monsoon season.My seven day detox was lived out amid a tailor-made programme of colon hydrotherapy (not as horrific as it may sound), detox drinks, nutritional supplements and freshly made food from the aptly named Love Kitchen. When I wasn’t choosing between the classes offered in the Yoga Suite, I could laze beside the striking outdoor swimming pool, indulge in a tempting massage or body therapy at the spa, or watch Hollywood films in the theatre in the evenings.Being just a five-minute walk from the bustling Chaweng Beach, there is plenty of entertainment to be discovered nearby, albeit only if you can resist the smells of street food and the happy hours of the beachside bars…Having resisted any temptation I managed to experience a truly perfect trip to Thailand; cultural insight, spiritual awakening, sand in my shoes, a sun-kissed glow, a shrinking waistline, and feeling as though I was the luckiest person in the world. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-thailand-surprise-coco-bijou/,Book Review: “Thailand Surprise” by Coco Bijou,Thailand,"In “Thailand Surprise“, a book by Coco Bijou, two women take a journey through Thailand expressing their thoughts and emotions as they travel. The book is filled with various photographs, snapshots, and pictures of drawings of the places they encountered on their tour. It is touted as a book intended for prospective first-time visitors and it might achieve that goal.The book focuses on their tour, starting from Bangkok and their visit to Wat Pho temple, then to a place called Koh Samui with beautiful sunsets and vistas. They visited Old Chiang Mai city and the temples there, at every stage documenting the trip with candid shots of architecture, street/temple scenes, and various items seen only in Thailand.It is really only a snapshot of what is possible to see in Thailand and only from the perspective of a week-long trip. Frankly, this book doesn’t have much substance and wouldn’t fill the pages except for the accompanying photos. The photos alternate between artful shots and very simple snaps of their trip locations.The book could be a very nice coffee table book and does have some very nice photos. Those seeking more detail on various cities in Thailand will find the book lacking.

But not just any type of food, I like exotic cuisine. Common burgers and pizza were never my thing. As far back as I can remember, I have always been into things that are out of the norm in terms of food and enjoyed experimenting. Maybe that is the reason why I love to do food travels. That is, traveling to different countries in order to have a taste of their unique cuisine. I even keep something like a diary in which I put the records of all my food-related impressions.The best destination in terms of exotic cuisine so far, in my opinion, has been Southeast Asia. Countries like Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand offered me amazing treats that managed to please my palate like no other meals before. Following is a brief description of my food travel to these distant and marvelous countries whose meals had the biggest culinary impact on me.CambodiaThe Cambodian cuisine, also known as Khmer cuisine, is one of the world’s oldest. Cambodians are known for their passion for rice. As a matter of fact, they are the nation that consumes the most rice.A distinctive ingredient in many Khmer dishes is prahok, which many Westerners might find a bit pungent, probably due to its nature, which is actually a type of fermented fish paste. As unusual as it may sound, it is an almost integral part of the Cambodian meals. It took me a while to get used to its taste but put in the proper meal, it is quite good.As for the meals themselves, my favorite one proved to be Amok trey, which is the most well-known amongst visitors. A freshwater fish fillet is prepared with a variety of aromatic spices (pounded lemongrass, shallots, garlic, etc.), egg, coconut milk and roasted peanuts. All of this is wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. The dish is not spicy at all but is very fragrant and zesty.IndonesiaIndonesian cuisine is rather diverse, mainly because of the fact that Indonesia is composed of about six thousand islands. However, just like Cambodia (and all other Asian countries), rice is an inseparable part of their meals. I noticed that Indonesians serve it both as a savory and a sweet food. Other staple foods they prefer include sweet potato, yam, and breadfruit.What impressed me a lot was the wide application of peanuts in many signature dishes – whole, ground or in the form of peanut sauce. My favorite Indonesian meal turned out to be the satay. Although it is also known in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, it originated in Indonesia. It consists of seasoned and grilled skewered meat served with sauce. The meat can be pork, chicken, goat, mutton, fish, etc. A variation made of tofu is also served. The sauce is usually soy-based.ThailandThai cooking is known to blend elements of several Southeast traditions. What I put in my ‘cuisine diary’ was that I noticed that most Thai dishes emphasize food prepared with strong aromatic components. Also, I learned (the hard way) of the famous spiciness of the local cuisine. The dishes in Thailand are famous for their balance of three or four fundamental food taste senses: bitter, sour, sweet and salty. Probably, I need not even mention the importance of rice in Thai cuisine. Its usage is as wide as in every other Asian country.As for my favorite Thai food… this is a bit tough to decide. I really enjoyed Kaeng hang-le, Bami haeng pet, but the one that appealed to me the most is Kai yang. It is basically a halved and pounded flat marinated grilled chicken. I believe that what gives Kai yang its special flavor is the special marinade, which includes garlic, fish sauce, coriander root, turmeric, and white pepper and the fact that it is prepared for a long time over a charcoal flame.I wish I could have included more meals in my report, but to be honest, I failed to remember the names of some of them (being in the locals’ language). After all, I tried so many dishes that in order to memorize all of them and their ingredients I would have needed to write a whole book. Bottom line, whichever country of Southeast Asia you might decide to visit, you are bound to be amazed by their cuisine. A true paradise for every foodie like myself.You can read more from Grace at http://www.vacationhomes.net/.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/elephant-sanctuary-chiang-mai/,"Elephant Sanctuary – Chiang Mai, Thailand",Thailand,"Elephant Sanctuary – Chiang MaiIt’s not quite what you expect when you arrive at your holiday accommodations.Instead of:  ”Welcome, there is chocolate on your pillow and happy hour starts at 5?” my visit to the Elephant Nature Park in Thailand’s Chiang Mai region started with a safety lecture, including such helpful tips as “Run away from aggressive elephants faster than they are running after you,” and “Avoid the moon bear who roams around the grounds.”Another guest asked, “Does the moon bear eat meat?”“Not yet,” was the answer.Learning Ethics from ElephantsFor all the careful warnings, the only aggression I saw during my weeklong stay was a heart-stopping moment when one female elephant attacked another. The sight of one of these massive beasts throwing her full weight against another was terrifying. The attacker was known to be the bully of the herd, her victim an elephant who had arrived at this sanctuary already injured.  We all heard a loud crack when Ma Bua Khum’s skull connected with the concrete platform. People gasped and the mahouts jumped into action. Ma Bua Khum struggled to get back to her feet, she had tumbled over onto her right side, falling over her bad ankle – already immobilized from a previous break.What startled me the most was the reaction of the other elephants.  No uncaring bystanders in this herd. They rallied around both the attacker and the victim, trumpeting to stop the attack and soothing the two involved in the fight with chirps and gentle caresses of their trunks. I had a lump in my through as I watched their response. I’d heard about the strong social connections between elephants, but seeing it in action is entirely different.And it reinforced my whole reason for coming here.Much as I love to travel, I’m always faced with the dilemma of living up to my own ethics and values. Traveling abroad often means confronting how our desires shape industries, economies, and cultures.Thailand has responded to being one of the world’s most popular tourist destinations by catering to the worlds’ demands. The exploitation of women is no secret, the signs selling sex are everywhere in downtown Bangkok, but the torture of animals for the amusement of tourists is little known, even by the average Thai.The population of Thailand is 95% Buddhist, a religion that eschews violence, but the brutal treatment of animals seems to fit within one of the philosophies’ loopholes. Elephants, the central symbol of the country, are often seen begging in the city streets, prancing to music at a festival or carrying a party of enthusiastic adventurers through the jungle’s thick foliage. Seeing these gentle giants up close is such a treat to visitors whose only previous experience involves zoos or circus performances, we gladly pay the price to watch them paint a picture or carry us around on their big, broad backs. But how often do we question the practices that have enabled this type of intimate interaction?Visiting the Elephant Nature ParkElephant Nature Park has attempted to counteract that by offering an ethical tourism experience that delivers an unforgettable opportunity to interact with the world’s largest land mammal balanced with education about conservation, animal exploitation and, oh yes, some serious manual labor.Visitors to the park careen up the lush, green hills of northern Thailand, about an hour away from the city of Chiang Mai, to arrive at an oasis in a small valley, fed by a mountain stream and inhabited by a herd of thirty happy pachyderms. They’re happy now, but most have lived through a lot of pain. Many have been injured by landmines, logging camp accidents or cars.  The visitors who opt to spend a week or more working with the elephants get ample opportunity to feed them, bathe them in the river, observe the soap opera of herd dynamics and hear the life story of each elephant – stories of suffering and survival.Every morning, after a refreshing cold shower I would grab a mug of coffee (enhanced with a little coconut milk), and pull up a seat overlooking the parks’ acreage. As the sun came up the elephants would amble over to their dining room – right in front of the volunteer’s eating area – and get ready to start their daily chore, eighteen hours of grazing.After filling up on the buffet breakfast, our team of international volunteers would be assigned our daily tasks – shoveling elephant poo; unloading tonnes of pumpkins, bananas, and watermelon; building fences; planting sugar cane; or splashing in the river with the happy herd.  Believe it or not we were always rooting for poo duty. We passed the hours with songs, stories from our travels and photographs of us standing beside, big, beautiful elephants.After a few days, you quickly become accustomed to walking among the elephants – but they don’t let you forget that this is their park. Trying to build a fence feels really futile when a two-year-old elephant keeps removing each post you pound into the ground.Lek and Darrick, the park’s founders have struggled to gain the support of the local community. Slowly, by engaging people through employment, conservation projects and opportunities to witness their work, the villagers have come on board. Their families have used elephants for many generations, so changing perspectives and practices takes time… Many of the local women provide Thai massages in the evenings – a treat to work-weary travelers and a significant influx of income to the local economy.Chang YimChang Yim, a mischievous male calf born at the park in 2009, may be a symbol of the future of elephants in Thailand. His rambunctious personality is a strong contrast to the older residents. I delighted in watching him tackle his sister, spout water from his trunk, and roll around on the sandy shores. At two or three years of age, most elephants in Thailand would be undergoing harsh training to make them yield to the request of humans. You see the legacy of that training in the elephants in the park, who still cower if someone raises a camera too quickly, remembering past pain. Some still have physical scars, almost all have emotional scars.Chang Yim is being trained, but using only positive reinforcement. He’s living evidence that these gentler methods work, and Lek’s hope is that his example will change the traditional practices.After a week with these remarkable animals, it’s my hope, too.And I’m relieved to be able to add that the moon bear is still vegetarian… so far.To learn more about the park visit ElephantNaturePark.orgShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/off-the-beaten-path-in-isan-northeast-thailand/,Off the Beaten Path in Isan (northeast Thailand),Thailand,"Huddled around dog-eared copies of Lonely Planet in a Bangkok cafe, groups of independent travelers are planning their route across Thailand, eagerly trying to devise routes that will provide them with plenty to see and do – and hopefully allow them to notch their belts with some trophy discoveries. Popping their guidebooks back into their backpacks, alongside a copy of Alex Garland’s “The Beach“, they all come to the same forlorn conclusion. They will head north to Chiang Mai for some trekking, then travel down south to chill at a remote beach, sustained by banana pancakes and fresh coconuts.The scenario unfolds daily along the Khao San road – Bangkok’s vastly expanded mecca of inexpensive accommodation for “Gap Year” visitors – and is more often than not duplicated by older, return visitors. As a result, the Northeast of the kingdom, known locally as Isan, remains largely unvisited – and unchanged by the pressures of the mass tourism markets.Udon Thani in Northern ThailandAfter some online research, we decided to fly up to Udon Thani, one of Isan’s main cities. From there, we would head on out to explore the outlying villages. Boarding a Nok Air flight to Udon Thani at Don Muang airport, we noticed that we were almost the only non-Thais on the plane, whilst the boarding gates for Phuket and Chiang Mai were predominantly comprised of holidaymakers. Were we making a big mistake?Fifty minutes later, the plane touched down in Udon Thani’s “international” airport. Originally built by the Americans as a base from which to bomb Vietnam and then Laos in the Secret War, the airport was a base for what was then known as “Air America”, as portrayed in the film starring Mel Gibson. The airport clearly had an international aspect back then, but today all flights landing there are domestic. It does have an unused international departures gate, and a barricaded Lao Airlines booth in the terminal still bears witness to the days when the Lao airline optimistically launched flights to Luang Prabang, before closing down…Gecko VillaKeen to get out of the city, we had booked a stay at the eclectically named Gecko Villa, a standalone property some half an hour out in the countryside. Ten, the owner, was at the airport to meet us, in a shirt festooned with geckos, and we were soon heading out of town in his pickup truck.The journey saw us take ever smaller roads until on the last leg we were bouncing along a potholed dirt track, before turning into the property via a long driveway of arched bamboo. Around us were patch-worked rice paddies, sugar cane plantations, and large-eyed water buffalo luxuriating in water holes.The private pool at Gecko VillaThis spacious Thai holiday villa was a very comfortable, three-bedroom property with a private swimming pool, surrounded by tropical gardens flowering with orchids, frangipani, banana, mango, and bougainvillea.We had planned the stay as a chance to simply chill out by the pool and relax – but Ten encouraged us to get out and about, and kindly accompanied us on our expeditions. He taught us how to commandeer his samlor (a kind of three-wheeled tuk-tuk), and we were soon able to get around quite respectably – even if corners always presented a subtle challenge. Children giggled and waived at the sight of us, and we were often flagged down by villagers keen to chat, as foreigners were obviously a novelty to them. MarketsThe local wet markets were an eye-opener, with a massive array of exotic fruit, fresh herbs, aromatic spices – and containers full of live fish and giant tiger prawns. Selecting some of the produce, we headed back to the villa where Ten’s wife showed us how to concoct several Thai and Isan dishes – although she was always mindful to keep the chilies to a level with which we could cope!The Isan specialties were deceptively simple to prepare and quite delicious: a zingy beef salad with fresh herbs called Laap was our favorite, accompanied by a green papaya salad and the indigenous sticky rice, served in woven containers.Time Slowed DownTime seems to have stood still – or at least to have slowed down – in Isan. In the villages, we watched as wizened old ladies hand wove silk and cotton in intricate, traditional patterns; in the rice paddies, water buffalo were still being used instead of tractors to plow the land, and along the roadsides grasses and bamboo were being dried to hand weave mats and containers which outnumbered any plastic produce.Water buffalo after a day’s work in the fieldsMonks in saffron robes and carrying outsized ochre umbrellas strolled barefoot to collect alms, and all the villagers we met were keen to stop and chat with none of the rush to work that occupies Thais in the capital.A highlight of our stay was an early morning trip to the local lake, where we clambered into a traditional wooden longboat and headed out through elephant grasses. Suddenly, before us, a vast expanse of dramatic lotus flowers appeared, carpeting the lake in pink as far as the eye could see.Fishermen cast circular nets as they foraged for lunch, small birds darted down as if to play with us as we made our way through the flowers, and every now and again wide-winged white heron would flap lazily and majestically into the blue sky. As we collected lotus stems, notions of the land of the lotus-eaters sprang to mind.UNESCO SiteNearby, and also worth a visit, is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ban Chiang. The striking pottery originally discovered at an archeological dig, with its trademark red ochre swirls, is still handcrafted here by artisans.The verdant rice fields farmed by Gecko VillaSustainabilityTen later explained that the villagers of Isan are almost all tied to private smallholdings, cultivating rice and a variety of other crops, and are very much at the mercy of the elements. Insufficient rain can lead to drought, whilst too much can bring flooding. Apart from arduous work in the fields, employment opportunities are limited, and millions of Isan natives are obliged to migrate to other provinces or even overseas to seek work – and are often cheated in the process.In establishing Gecko Villa as a sustainable project with a focus on responsible travel, they hoped not only to prevent the breakup of families seeking work elsewhere in the kingdom, but also to encourage visitors to travel to Isan and experience the warmth and hospitality of the locals, the renowned cuisine, and the rich historical remains of the plateau. They have clearly been successful, and have launched a second traditional Thai villa called Green Gecko, an imposing Thai house centered around a high wooden deck and a very private swimming pool.ReflectionBack in the Bangkok cafe, the guidebooks are again being rifled through. We feel tempted to talk to the young family sitting next to us and to suggest a trip to the backwaters of Isan. Yet simultaneously we also wonder whether, one day, there will be a Lonely Planet guide to Isan, and whether tourism there, too, will come to be dominated by foreign multinationals to the detriment of the locals.We decide this is unlikely. Isan has no beaches, no hill tribes to dress in colorful garb for the photographers, and very few of the locals speak English, as they stick resolutely to their fundamentally Lao dialect. It will remain off the beaten tourist path, appealing to those seeking authenticity and the true heart of the country. ”Go”, we say. Like its cuisine, like its smiling inhabitants or its lilting melodies of morlam, it has soul – and will call you back.Getting There – Ironically, as many Isan natives work out of the region, the area is easy to access. Main road arteries lead up to Nong Khai on the Lao border from Bangkok, and across to Ubon from the capital. Trains serve the major cities, again from Bangkok. There are also numerous flights from the capital to the major cities, serviced by the national carrier Thai Airways and by the inexpensive domestic airlines www.nokair.com and www.airasia.comShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/artist-in-thailand/,An Artist in Thailand – Thailand through the Eyes of a Painter,Thailand,"Stephan Giannini Painting in Sukothai, Thailand, February 2010I am a professional artist and have been lucky enough to take several long painting focused trips. Starting In early January 2010 I embarked on a four-month painting and travel tour of the Indochina region, which included Thailand as well as Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Myanmar.  I paint in oils and it is a lot of equipment to lug around, but once I am set up, it all seems worthwhile. One thing I would mention is that the whole time I painted in Asia I was surrounded by on-lookers, especially children.BangkokI started my trip in Bangkok and it was quite exciting and fun just wandering around. My favorite part of Bangkok were the water taxis on the Chao Praya River. But it is very hot and humid there. It probably took me a couple of weeks to get over the jet lag and adjust to the heat-induced lethargy, which seems to be pretty typical for visitors here. There was a foot of snow on the ground when I left Chicago and suddenly I was confronted with 90 degrees and very high humidity. At first, I really couldn’t paint. It was just too uncomfortable and tiring. But after the first couple of weeks, I started some work, although I was careful to avoid the sun in the afternoon and just generally stay in the shade.And Bangkok! A more frenetic place one cannot imagine. Of American cities it is most like New York, but not as clean. Traffic is extremely heavy and it is filthy, in parts. Really there are two cities here, one for the rich and one for the poor. There are lots of newer high-rises as well as real slums, although it is not dangerous.I also spent some time in southern Thailand visiting my German uncle who has a quiet country house near Chumpon. Perhaps most importantly I learned how to ride a scooter while there. Later during my trip, I frequently rented one, which really made painting more productive. That is something I highly recommend as it really frees one up when you have lots of equipment to transport in the heat.Sukothai RuinsSukothaiAfter Chumpon I went to Sukothai, which is north of Bangkok. Sukothai is a very pretty archeological site from an earlier civilization and there I finally started to get some more serious drawings and oil sketches done. The Park itself was very different from the rest of Thailand, because of rather minimal traffic and general cleanliness.  The city of Sukothai was rather low key as well.I traveled to Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia from Thailand but returned to Northern Thailand at the end of my trip. The border crossing involved a boat but was otherwise uneventful. It was back to the stifling heat in Thailand (now the hot season there) after the mildness of northern Laos. The heat pretty much stopped my painting for the rest of the trip. I may have also been getting tired of traveling after almost 3 months. You might say the vacation really began now as I spent a lot of time just hanging out and talking to fellow travelers.Chang RaiI stopped in Chang Rai for a couple of days. Chang Rai is a relatively unexciting place, except for two wonderful artists built ‘temples”, the White Temple and the Black Temple. Both temples are Buddhist structures, but not official Wats. The White one is, well white, and a bit ice cream garnish in appearance. It has some great murals inside but I found the architecture crass. The Black Temple on the other side of town was one of the most beautiful structures and grounds I found in Thailand (or anywhere). Somber and dark, it has wood relief work and wooden furniture/sculpture all around.Read more about Chang Rai here: White Temple Chiang Rai – Instagramming the beauty of Wat Rong KhunThewet, Bangkok, ThailandChang MaiI proceeded on to Chang Mai where I hoped to get my visa extended and do some painting.  Chang Mai was a pleasant place, but apparently, I could only get my visa extended for 7 days. The problem is that when you cross by land into Thailand you only get a 15-day visa (30 days if you come by air). Because they have problems with foreigners working under the table, here they only allow a 7-day extension (for $60). So you end up having to do a land crossing every 15 days to another country. To do this I went to the south of Thailand where I intended to visit my uncle. From my uncle’s house in Chumpon, I took a bus to Ranong and then a boat to Victoria Point, Myanmar. It was all quick and uneventful (lots of people do this), but street-hustlers glom on you as soon as you leave the Myanmar passport control. Since I could not get rid of these guys I just went back by boat to Thailand right away, although I had hoped to look around for a few hours.Ko Pha Ngan IslandScooter being drenched on Thai New YearVisa in hand, I then proceeded to Ko Pha Ngan Island. A touristy and party island that many people I met had visited and really enjoyed. Here I had a beachfront bungalow and beautiful ocean views.  Mai Had beach is also a great place to do some snorkeling with a stunning coral reef. The big excitement during my stay there was  Songkran, the Thai new years and water festival. When this is celebrated, Thai people  (and some tourists) arm themselves with water pistols, hoses or buckets and generally drench anyone who passes by.During the festival, I decided to go out on my motor scooter to check out the party on the rest of the island and spent the day getting totally drenched by partiers on the side of the road. It sounds a little dangerous but mostly they wave you down and you have to “accept” the invitation to be “attacked”, or there is a traffic jam and you just submit. It was extremely hot so actually a lot of fun.Sculpted Buddha, SukothaiPhuketOn April 15 I took a boat and bus to Phuket, which is a touristy vacation island a bit farther south. Not really much of interest to me there, but parts of the island are very beautiful. There is also a red light district here, which was almost comical with the Disney-esque lady-boys and the western families with children walking around gawking at it all.In conclusion, it was an extraordinary trip, both educational and interesting. Overall, I was not that thrilled with Thailand. I found the cities and towns too congested and dirty and just plain unattractive for the most part, although some markets and older streets are exceptions. Where Thailand shined for me was in the food, especially what I found at street stalls, which was always affordable and usually delicious.The paintings I created are all small single session sketches around 6 x 9 in. in size. The drawings are a little larger. To see most of the work I did on this trip take a look at Painting On Location In Southeast Asia. If you’re interested in the logistics of my painting gear you can take a look at My Asian Painting Equipment.PodcastTo learn more about travel to Thailand listen to one of our podcast episodes about Thailand.Share this: "

Some tourists aren’t required to have a letter depending primarily on nationality.All Central Asia counties, excluding Kyrgyzstan, require a visa from travelers. Visas may be simple to get through arranged tours and specialized travel agencies or next to impossible – it all depends on the country and the mood of the government. Arrange as many visas as possible before leaving for a trip and plan time to deal with the embassies in each nation prior to leaving.The best airport to fly into the region is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Many flights also land in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but this airport can be a bit seedy and even dangerous after dark.Trains provide a popular way into the countries of Central Asia. Trains regularly arrive in Almaty, Bishkek, and Tashkent from Moscow and cities in China. Travel by boat and car is irregular and not highly recommended.Samarkand in Uzbekistan is one of the most famous of the Silk Road cities and is a testament to the Islamic style of building and architecture with domes and stunning tile work.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/first-time-travel-tunisia/,First Time Travel to Tunisia,Tunisia,"I wanted to visit Tunisia, a place I’ve never been before, because I wanted to experience their culture and vast historical heritage. I wanted to stay in small towns not too populated by tourists and explore on my own. I’m not a seasoned traveller so I knew I needed to do my research about the area.  I compared quotes on flythomascook.com, my usual travel agents, against popular airlines and flight centres. I looked into some hotels in Enfidha that weren’t too populated with tourists and found a small family owned house converted into the Sinbad Hotel, where I rented a room for the night I landed.I travelled from the coast of Port El Kantaoui-Sousse to the pearlescent white-washed homes along the SidiBou Said (Tunisia’s Mediterranean stretch of coastline) staying in small guesthouses and peppering my stay in two 4-star hotels along the way. I always make sure I budget for my trip by checking out forums and reviews (such as Tripadvisor and Lonely planet) to research the best deals so I can spend more money on food and curios.Sousse MedinaThere is a sensory overload when you visit Medina’s in Tunisia, not only with all the exotic scents but also just the labyrinth of people that you will need to maneuver through. The alleys are lined with curios, food stalls, clothing and perfume. I was in awe of the architecture and sheer beauty of the Mosques and Madrassas (Islam Clerical Colleges). There were coves of craftsman, you would miss them if you weren’t looking down a small alley. Their workmanship and skill as masons, carpenters and blacksmiths rivals that of any that I’ve seen.Don’t be intimidated by the lack of prices on items, there is rarely a set price to the traditional items being sold at markets and along the roads. Before you visit, brush up on your haggling skills, as almost everything is up for negotiation. Haggle well (I kept telling myself that’s it’s part of their culture…so as not to feel too bad about buying a scarf off a kindly old woman) but I got good deals. With just a little bit of persistence, you should be able to wangle a fair price. Remember everything is negotiable, even the cost of camels at the Pushkar Fair.El-Jem (formerly the Roman town of Thysdrus)The main attraction in this halfway point city between Sousse and Sfax is the Roman Amphitheater, now a UNESCO World Heritage site. You might also recognize it from the film Gladiator. It illustrates the true engineering proficiency with a movable floor and pulley-systems to entertain the masses over 2000 years ago.Try and see it either when the sun is rising or setting, the auburn glow of the Amphitheater is brilliant, especially from the higher levels.When you go down to beneath the arena (the main stage, where are the action takes place) are more intact and reachable rooms (better preserved and accessible than its twin the Coliseum in Rome), where fighters, animals and ‘staff’ were kept during the ‘shows’. The theatre also houses a beautiful collection of mosaics that I thought was better than that at the Bardo Museum for its preservation and for the restored Roman Villa that shows their bravura style and the variations in floor plans for different levels of society. Al-Qayrawan (Kairouan)The way I organized my tour, was to go more inland than south (where most people visit the set of the Star Wars early franchises) but because I was passing through Al-Qayrawan, there is only one site worth visiting if you’re only there for a short time and that’s the Zaouia (an arrangement of buildings around a saint’s tomb) of Sidi Abid el-Ghariani, which dates from around the 14th-century. Although it’s quite empty, most of the attraction is in the construction, tiles and exquisite architecture. Well worth a visit if you’re in the area.Bulla Regia, Northwest of JendoubaThe Romans really knew how to live, love and have a good time. They were inventive and you can see it all in these complete and preserved underground villas. The mosaics (although most have been taken to the Bardo Museum) range from simple and elegant to gaudy and grandiose. Definitely visit the House of Fishing and see the Venus and Centaurs in the House of Amphitrite.The Bardo National Museum, Le BardoI nearly missed this museum, but I’m glad I didn’t. It has an exquisite collection of Roman, Phoenician and Islamic artefacts, mosaics and collections. There’s a solid gold statue of amour but it’s more of a chest plate made of bronze and gold for the Punics (a Hellanistic time period people) campaign warriors for Hannibal. The museum has an extensive Greek and Egyptian collection through extensive land and underwater excavations.Carthage, TunisiaCarthage was the home to Hannibal who led his army, including elephants, over the Alps to attack Rome in the Second of the three Punic Wars that Rome and Carthage fought for controlled of the Mediterranean. The Romans stormed this once great city in the last of the Punic Wars . Carthage couldn’t hold on and the Romans destroyed it. We saw were Roman basilicas, bathhouses and traditional homes.Tabarka to Sidibou Said (Northwest Coastal towns)The quiet coastal town of Tabarka is a hub for music lovers. They have a fusion of Algerian-pop, Jazz festivals mixed in with a bit of Latin and African World beats. I stayed in a beach villa, and was close to both the city festival and a small music gathering on the beach. I didn’t visit the cork forests (I’m not that big on hiking) so I decided to travel the coast to SidiBou Said to see Greek inspired lime-washed homes and spent the remainder of my trip on the beach and in the sea.You will never forget the exhilarating and sometimes over-whelming cultural experiences that Tunisia has to offer amongst its caves, hills, alleyways and monuments. Take the time to travel to a country that mixes the familiar West with the exotic East.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/3-days-in-instanbul/,"3 Days in Istanbul, Turkey",Turkey,"If you, like me, are a history buff then Istanbul is a place to visit before you die. It is an amazing city that has a history that goes back to the Romans overlaid with Ottoman and Turkish history. Combine that with vibrant markets, great food and welcoming people for a must-see destination. While I recommend a longer itinerary to see Istanbul, this is an itinerary you can use to see some of the best sites of Istanbul in 3 days.What to Do for 3 Days in Istanbul Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}What to Do in Istanbul in 3 DaysDay 1 – SultanahmetHagia SophiaSultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque)Have a traditional lunchTopkapi PalaceGrand BazaarSpice BazaarDay 2 – BeyoğluBridge to BeyoğluTünelGalata TowerWalk the İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)Dolmabahçe PalaceDay 3OrtaköyBosphorus cruiseVisit AsiaIstanbul Attractions MapDay 1 – SultanahmetThe oldest part of the city is the Sultanahmet district. It is still inside the old Roman walls. It is a triangular-shaped area with the old walls at the west, the body of water known as the Golden Horn at the north and the Sea of Marmara to the south which connects via the narrow straights known as the Dardanelles to the Aegean Sea. Istanbul is located here because of its position on this strategic waterway (see map).Hagia Sophiahttp://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-73193-08-01-2007.m4vThe crowning achievement in Roman (later Byzantine) architecture was the church Hagia Sophia which is now a museum in Sultanahmet. Its impressive dome on dome design so impressed the Ottoman Turks after they captured the city that you can find Mosques that are influenced by its design throughout the former Ottoman Empire.The interior of Hagia Sophia is quite large and even more amazing when you realize that this building was built in the 6th century. As you can see from the photo above, there are elements of the use of Hagia Sophia as a church but also from its use from the 1400s as a mosque.In addition to the architecture, the beautiful mosaics are some of the best examples of Roman / Byzantine art.Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque)The most notable of the mosques that were influenced by the design of Hagia Sophia is the so-called Blue Mosque which is located just opposite it. Stand in between the two and the similarities will be fairly obvious.The nickname Blue Mosque comes from some of the tiles in the interior of the mosque (which is really not particularly blue).Visiting a mosque: You can enter the mosque even if you are a tourist and not a Muslim, although you should not enter during prayer-time or during the middle of the day on Fridays. You will need to wear appropriate dress which means no sleeveless shirts or shorts. At the Blue Mosque, they may offer you a robe if your clothing is inappropriate, but that will not be available at smaller mosques. Women should have a scarf they can use to cover their heads. Remain respectful and inconspicuous as people are here to worship. Flash photography is not appropriate.The real name of the mosque is the Sultan Ahmet Mosque after which the Sultanahmet district is named. The Sultanahmet name has a more interesting story. Sultan Ahmet (or Ahmed I) caused all kinds of controversy when he commissioned the mosque to be built with 6 minarets. Look around Istanbul and the number of minarets that a mosque has tells you the significance of the person who built it. While a neighborhood mosque would have 1, a mosque built by a sultan could be expected to have as many as 4 minarets. But when Sultan Ahmet had this mosque built only the mosque in Mecca had 6 minarets. It was pointed out that Sultan Ahmet had won no great victory for Islam that would justify this hubris. Ahmet’s solution was brilliant. Rather than knock down one of his minarets he paid from his own fortune to build a 7th minaret in Mecca.Have a Traditional LunchOne of the specialties of Istanbul is the Sultanahmet kofte. This is a spicy ground meat dish that is often served with peppers. One very popular restaurant for this is Sultanahmet Koftecisi.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-84122-10-20-2007.mp4Topkapi PalaceThe Topkapi Palace is just around the corner from Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque. It was built shortly after the conquest of Istanbul in 1453 and was the center of the Ottoman Empire until the 1800s when the more modern Dolmabahçe Palace was built north of Sultanahmet.Don’t expect a lot of furniture in the palace as this palace is an oriental design where people sat on pillows or cushions in large relatively sparse rooms.Pay special attention to the quality of the tile work or the windows inlaid with abalone shells. This is where a lot of the craftsmanship is displayed in this sprawling palace. I visited with someone who could point out the intricate blue tiles from nearby Iznik and the poorer craftsmanship of later replacement tile work after the tile industry in Iznik declined in the 1700s.In addition to visiting the harem and the throne room, the national treasure of Turkey is housed in the Palace. The collection has a large number of relics such as Mohammed’s footprint, one of his teeth and a selection of hairs from his beard, Moses’ rod, Abraham’s saucepan, and John the Baptist’s hand. It was a surprise to me that an Islamic culture would even have relics.Grand BazaarIf you go to the Grand Bazaar someone will try and sell you a carpet. They will offer you tea and invite you to come in and sit down. They will do this in perfect English or any of a number of other languages. I honestly think they think every tourist really wants a carpet and that my refusals were simply negotiating. The shop that I visited was run by a couple of Kurdish brothers. I was wearing a microphone at the time so you can eavesdrop on the process if you listen to Turkey, Istanbul – Amateur Traveler Episode 83.I love the energy of the bazaar. Watch for boys who are carrying copper trays with small glasses of hot tea on them to the various merchants. You can certainly buy souvenirs here but there are real bargains as well… especially if you want a carpet. I visited with a Turkish young man from Gaziantep in eastern Turkey. He claimed you can get much better prices in Gaziantep because the carpets are made there.Spice BazaarEven more colorful than the Grand Bazaar is the spice bazaar with piles of colorful spices (and lots of souvenirs). What I really needed was a cookbook to know how to use all of these wonderful spices. Photographers and Instagrammers will love it.Day 2 – BeyoğluBridge to BeyoğluIf you are staying in Sultanahmet, walk over the bridge that crosses the body of water called the Golden Horn to Beyoğlu. Along the way note the fisherman that can be found on the bridge catching their lunch for the day.TünelJust north of the Golden Horn is the neighborhood of Beyoğlu. In southern Beyoğlu right near the water is the 2nd oldest subway in the world (after the London Underground). The Tünel is not nearly as extensive as the Underground. It is a funicular that climbs the hill from the Golden Horn towards Galata Tower.Galata TowerGalata Tower is the most notable landmark in Beyoğlu. It was originally built by the Genoese and called the Tower of Christ. It offers a great view of the old city (Sultanahmet, Fatih).Walk the İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue) runs from Galata Tower towards Taksim Square. This is a pedestrian shopping street. When Istanbul was the capital, this area is where most of the foreign embassies were. There are still at least 4 foreign consulates along this street.Along the avenue, you will find the Galata Mevlevi Museum which is dedicated to the Mevlevi branch of Sufism which is better known as the Whirling Dervishes. You can see the Whirling Dervish Dance show here.There are also some churches on this street that are still active. This neighborhood used to be a greek neighborhood until the forced resettlement of greeks and Turks after the Greek War of Independence.A fun place to eat along the İstiklal Caddesi is Cicek Pasaji (Flower Passage). This restaurant used to be a flower market.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-73210-08-02-2007.m4vDolmabahçe PalaceThe Dolmabahçe Palace was built in the 1800s as a more modern replacement for Topkapi Palace. This is a very European style palace complete with imported chandeliers from Venice and furniture from Paris. The palace cost the sultan 25% of his yearly tax revenue and the debt that it caused helped speed up the decline of the Ottomans.For Turks, one special place in the palace is the bedroom where Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, died.Day 3OrtaköyOne of the iconic photos of Istanbul is the view of a small mosque and the Bosphorus Bridge in the background. The mosque in the photo is in Ortaköy on a beautiful small square near the base of the bridge. There are some good places to grab a bite, a photo and also a boat for a cruise on the Bosphorus.Bosphorus cruiseA cruise along the Bosphorus will go from the city up to at least the fortress built on each side of the water by Mehmed the Conqueror and his father. Along the way, you will see mansions, mosques and quiet neighborhoods.1.5-Hour Morning Bosphorus Boat TourUS $20BuyVisit AsiaSo far we have only spent time in the European part of the city. I would recommend taking a ferry over to the Asian side of the city for your last afternoon and evening. This is where much of the population of the city lives and it’s worth a visit. I would recommend visiting the Kadikoy marketplace and then finding a place to eat dinner back on the water with a view of the Bosphorus Bridge.Istanbul Attractions Map            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/Istanbul.kml?v3"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(13);    });  }AccommodationsI have stayed in both a small older boutique hotel in the Sultanahmet neighborhood as well as a more modern hotel in the Taksim square area. I recommend Sultanahmet for history buffs and Taksim more for people who are looking for nightlife.ConclusionI would recommend staying even longer in Istanbul than 3 days, but if 3 days is all you have you can still enjoy this wonderful city. To see what I skipped to make a 3-day itinerary check out 22 Must See Places in Istanbul.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/must-see-places-in-istanbul/,22 Must See Places in Istanbul – Turkey,Turkey,"Istanbul is one of my favorite cities in the world. People who have been there always seem to understand that when I declare it. It is only those who have not been there yet who wonder why Istanbul. It is s city with a rich and enduring history that goes back to Roman times, overlaid with a Muslim, Turkish history which goes back to 1453. It feels like a European city, which it is, but at times can also feel like a Middle Eastern city. It has one foot in Europe and one in Asia and is a great gateway city to the Muslim world.In this post, I will talk about some of my favorite sites to see in Istanbul. Also check out 3 Days in Istanbul, Turkey for an itinerary.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Istanbul SitesHagia SophiaSultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque)Topkapi PalaceBasilica CisternObelisk of Thutmose III (Hippodrome)Grand BazaarMısır Çarşısı (Spice Bazaar)Theodosian WallsYedikule (Fortress of the Seven Towers)Saint Savior In ChoraSüleymaniye MosqueTünelGalata Towerİstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)Taksim SquareDolmabahçe PalaceOrtaköy and the Bosphorus BridgeBosphorus CruiseRumelihisarı and AnadoluhisarıFree Things to do in IstanbulIstanbul Attractions MapAccommodationsConclusionIstanbul SitesHagia SophiaOne of the most enduring buildings in Istanbul is Hagia Sophia. This church was built by order of the Roman Emperor Justinian I. It was the world’s largest building from its completion in 537 until the completion of the cathedral in Seville Spain in 1520, almost 1,000 years.It was built as a Christian cathedral but then served as a mosque after the Turkish conquest in 1453. At the time the Christian elements of the church were covered up and only exposed again when it became a museum in modern Turkey.What’s the point of being emperor if you can’t include a picture of you and your queen along with your good friend Mary the mother of Jesus.Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque)Hagia Sophia influenced the design of churches in the region and later also influenced the design of mosques like the famous Blue Mosque (Sultan Ahmet Mosque) just opposite from Hagia Sophia.The nickname Blue Mosque comes from some of the tiles in the interior of the mosque (which is really not particularly blue).Visiting a mosque:Non-muslims are welcome to visit mosques like the Sultan Ahmet Mosque but should not enter during prayer times or worship times mid-day on Friday. Dress appropriately. Don’t wear short or revealing clothing. Women should cover their heads. Carry a simple scarf so that you are ready to peek into an interesting mosque you may see. Remember that you are visiting a house of worship and act accordingly. This is not the place to do flash photography or a shout out to your friends on Live Chat.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-84122-10-20-2007.mp4Topkapi PalaceAfter the conquest of Istanbul by Mehmed the Conqueror in 1453, he built himself a palace in the oriental design of the Turks. This remained the palace of the Ottoman Empire until it was replaced in 1843 by Dolmabahçe palace. The palace is part of the Historic Areas of Istanbul UNESCO site as is Hagia Sophia.Don’t expect a lot of furniture in the palace as this palace is a much more oriental design where people sat on pillows or cushions in large relatively sparse rooms. It is a reminder that while you are standing in Europe today, the Turks came originally from much further east and were more influenced at the time of its construction by the east than the west.A museum in the palace holds the national treasures of Turkey. These treasures include jewel-encrusted swords, manuscripts, but also significant religious relics like the turban of Joseph, the staff of Moses, a tooth from Mohammed, and the swords of the first four Caliphs.Basilica CisternTo get some sense of the layering of history in Istanbul, visit the Basilica Cistern. This underground reservoir was built by the Emperor Justinian in the 6th century. After the conquest by the Turks, it was forgotten for 100 years until someone started to wonder how local residents were able to fish through holes in their basements. Apparently, there are hundreds of ancient cisterns below the city streets of Istanbul.Look for the two different columns that have the head of the mythical Medusa at their base.Obelisk of Thutmose III (Hippodrome)One reminder that Istanbul was once a Roman city is the Egyptian Obelisk of Thutmose III. This obelisk dates back to the 1400s BC. but was brought to Constantinople by the Roman Emperor Constantius II in 357 A.D. to celebrate being on the throne for 20 years. It was later moved to this site which was the site of the old Roman Hippodrome or horse racing course. Look at the shape of the long narrow square you are in and see if you can picture charioteers like in the movie Ben Hur.Right next to the obelisk is the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts.Grand BazaarIf you are looking to do some shopping, especially for a Turkish carpet then you should make a stop at the expansive Grand Bazaar. This is an indoor shopping area that has plenty that tourists might buy. The shop keepers speak an astonishing array of languages.Mısır Çarşısı (Spice Bazaar)As a photographer, I love the Spice Bazaar for its displays of fragrant spices. A small bag of spices to cook something Turkish can make a great souvenir, especially if you take the time to take a cooking class while you are in Istanbul.Theodosian WallsFor over a thousand years the impressive Walls of Constantinople kept out all invaders (well, there was that one regrettable incident in the 4th crusade that no one wants to talk about). They kept out enemies like the Ostrogoths and Atilla the Hun. You can still walk these walls and see what made them so impressive. They are far enough away from the normal tourist areas that you will need to grab a bus or an Uber to get to them. If you managed to breach the outer wall you had the unpleasant surprise of finding yourself trapped between it and an inner wall. It was not until Mehmed the Conqueror brought his canons to besiege it that they fell.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-85310-10-29-2007.mp4Yedikule (Fortress of the Seven Towers)Anchoring the Walls of Constantinople at the southern point is the Fortress of the Seven Towers. This is a great place to get up on the walls and explore.From the walls look south and you can see something like 100 ships bringing goods through the Bosphorus.Saint Savior In ChoraOn the way to the Theodisian Walls stop at one of my favorite under-visited spots in Istanbul: Saint Savior In Chora Church. It is a small church unlike the towering Hagia Sophia but Saint Savior In Chora has some of the best-preserved Byzantine mosaics and murals. Both churches had the murals plastered over when they were converted to mosques after the conquest of the Turks in the 1400s, and both also had them uncovered when they were converted into museums in the 1900s.Watch Travel to Istanbul – St Saviour in Chora – Amateur Traveler Video Episode 14 to see what this site looks like today.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-85291-10-29-2007.mp4Süleymaniye MosqueThe Süleymaniye Mosque was built by Suleiman the Magnificent. Suleiman was a sultan at the highpoint of Ottoman rule. His armies conquered Hungary, Rhodes, Belgrade and threaten all of Western Europe before they were defeated at the walls of Vienna. A bit of trivia for you, the croissant was invented in Vienna to commemorate the victory over the Ottoman Turks, hence its crescent shape.TünelYou may have heard that London has the oldest subway in the world, but did you know that Istanbul has the second oldest? The Tünel is quite different from the Underground as it is an underground funicular that is made to climb the hill of the neighborhood of Beyoğlu towards the Galata Tower.Galata TowerThe very un-Turkish looking tower that this the most notable landmark in the neighborhood of Beyoğlu is the Galata Tower. It was built by the Genoese in 1348 when the city had expanded to the northern shore of the body of water known as the Golden Horn.İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)İstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue) is a pedestrian shopping street that runs from Galata Tower towards Taksim Square. This is where you will rub shoulders with the real day to day life of Istanbul as it is as popular with locals as it is with touristsStop at the Galata Mevlevi Museumto see the famous Whirling Dervish Dance show. The Whirling Dervishes are a Sufi order of Islam. It was founded by a 13th-century Persian poet and is known for its exuberant dance.If you are an art lover the Istanbul Modern Art Museumis very near to the avenue.The Flower Passage (Cicek Pasaji) is a colorful flower market that has been converted into a popular traditional restaurant.Taksim SquareWhen you get to Taksim Square you are in an area of shops, restaurants, and hotels that is the heart of modern Istanbul. The monument in the center of the square is dedicated to the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923. Taksim square is also a major transit hub.Dolmabahçe PalaceThe Dolmabahçe Palace is an ornate palace built in the European style towards the end of Ottoman rule. While Topkapi Palace may seem sparsely decorated the same cannot be said for Dolmabahçe. The decorator was not going for subtile.Dolmabahçe Palace is colorful, lavash and cost about 25% of the annual revenue. The Ottoman empire was not in great financial shape at the time of its construction. This didn’t help.Ortaköy and the Bosphorus BridgeOne of the photos most used by the Turkish tourism board to promote the country is the picture of this small mosque at the base of the Bosphorus Bridge in a small square filled with pigeons. This picturesque spot is Ortaköy. If it does not look familiar now, you will be surprised by how many times you see this picture in the future.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-73210-08-02-2007.m4vBosphorus CruiseIstanbul is defined by the water that surrounds it. It is hard to say you have been to Istanbul if you have not gotten out into a boat. This might just be a ferry from the European side of the city to the Asian side, but I also highly recommend a cruise up the Bosphorus towards the Black Sea.Rumelihisarı and AnadoluhisarıNorth of the city you can see the two fortresses built on either side of the Bosphorus Rumelihisarı (on the Europe side built by Mehmed the Conqueror) and Anadoluhisarıa (on the Asia side built by his father Murad II). These fortresses were built in preparation for the siege of Istanbul. They were later used to control trade on the Bosphorus, coming in and out of the Black SeaWhile you can tour them if you just want to get a photo of them I highly recommend a cruise on a site-seeing boat on the Bosphorus. You can catch one from Ortaköy.Free Things to do in IstanbulFrom this list, all outdoor sites, bazaars, and mosques are free… unless you buy a carpet at the Grand Bazaar.Grand Bazaarİstiklal Caddesi (İstiklal Avenue)Obelisk of Thutmose III (Hippodrome)Ortaköy MosqueSpice BazaarSüleymaniye MosqueSultan Ahmet Mosque (Blue Mosque)Taksim SquareIstanbul Attractions Map            var map;      var src = ""https://amateurtraveler.com/maps/Istanbul.kml?v3"";  function initMap() {            map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {              });            var kmlLayer = new google.maps.KmlLayer(src, {     map: map    });    google.maps.event.addListenerOnce(map, 'zoom_changed', function() {      map.setZoom(13);    });  }AccommodationsI recommend staying in the Sultanahmet neighborhood if you are looking for a quiet place in the history part of the city. If you are looking for nightlife stay closer to the Taksim square area.ConclusionIstanbul has much to offer as a modern city but if you love history then a visit to this city is a must.For what to see if you only have 3 days, check out 3 Days in Istanbul, TurkeyShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/top-7-hot-springs-europe-worth-long-haul-flight/,Top 7 Hot Springs in Europe That Are Worth the Long-Haul Flight,Turkey,"What better way to relax on holiday than in natural hot springs. As well as relaxing they have quite a few health benefits too, soaking away the tension that has built up through the year. Many hot spring destinations have spa facilities nearby and health conscious hotels to add to your pampering and rejuvenating break. Here are some of Europe’s best natural hot springs in beautiful locations that will help you melt away that stress.The Blue Lagoon Iceland, photo from pixabay1.    The Blue Lagoon IcelandOne of the most popular hot springs today, when you see the blue lagoon in Iceland you will know why. The beautiful scenery needs to be seen in person as photos just don’t do it justice. Take a dip in the hot water and try rubbing the white geothermal mud on your face for that extra special relaxation experience. The lagoon can get busy especially when there are large tour groups visiting all at once.The lagoon is only 30 minutes from Reykjavik which makes it a great day trip whilst on a break in the city. Prices start from 5400 ISK depending on which package you choose.2.    Terme di Saturnia, Tuscany, ItalyThe pure volcanic spring water is fed straight into the pools here, being replenished every four hours. Although these springs are part of a resort, non-resident guests are welcome to use the pools. The idyllic location adds to the relaxing atmosphere and mud treatments are also available upon request. The Spring waters are known for their rejuvenating qualities and many people with medical ailments combine soaking in the waters with other treatments.Located in Grosseto, Tuscany, the best way to get here is by road and if you are staying at the hotel in the resort transport can be arranged for you.Thermal Spa Tuscany Photo from Pixabay3.    Heviz Lake, Heviz, HungaryThis thermal lake is the largest of its kind in the world. Although the village started to form in the 18th century, the bath house was not built on the lake until the 20th century and from then on more and more visitors have come to enjoy the benefits of the lake.Single entrance tickets to the Thermal Lake are available in different categories costing 2 400 HUF for three hours, 2 600 HUF for four hours, or 3 700 HUF for a whole day.

https://amateurtraveler.com/exploring-dalaman-turkey-and-the-lycian-way/,"Exploring Dalaman, Turkey and the Lycian Way",Turkey,"Kayakoy ghost town in southwestern TurkeyDalaman is a fantastic destination for anyone who is new to Turkey. While the town benefits from excellent facilities and a wide range of activities thanks to its proximity to main tourist resorts, Dalaman itself remains fairly quiet and the coastline is just begging to be explored, allowing more adventurous travellers like myself to get away from the tourist crush.Dalaman, TurkeySituated just ten minutes from the airport, Dalaman is set in lush pine forests. For most of the year the weather is hot and sunny, although off-peak is relatively comfortable for British travellers. I chose to go last autumn which was absolutely ideal in terms of climate.Upon arrival, I spent a few days just chilling out on the stunning blue flag beaches at Dalaman and Sarigerme. These two resorts are split by the Dalaman River, which offered some high-octane white water rafting – not something for the faint of heart!Turquoise CoastOnce I’d settled in and started to get to know the place, I was ready to explore further. The stretch of coastline, also known as the Turquoise Coast, is famous for its serene, clear, azure waters—hence the nickname. What better way to explore the spectacular coastline and its views then to embark on the 500 kilometre Lycian Way trek, named for the ancient kingdom of Lycia which once covered this area. As an avid walker, I had always heard how immensely rewarding this particular hike was and I was eager to get started.Beach in the Lagoon of Oludeniz, Lycian coastIn the first stage of this beautiful journey, I stopped in the small town of Fethiye, one of Dalaman’s neighbouring resorts, which stands on the ancient city of Telmessos, where I spent the afternoon exploring the historic ruins. The cliff side tombs and the medieval Knights Castle were arguably the highlights of the entire trip.Tired out from my wall, I spent the night in Fethiye before travelling on to Kayakoy, a spectacular, atmospheric ghost town with sea views which will completely blow you away. I then braved the mountain path to the lagoon of Oludeniz, but chose to get the bus on to Ovacik, the official start of the Lycian Way.Lycian WayFrom there, I climbed the steep slopes of the Baba Dag mountain range and was rewarded with indescribably beautiful coastal views. By this time, my stomach was starting to rumble, so I made my way to a small village called Faralya where I had lunch overlooking the beach. Sadly, this was the last stop on my tour and I had to leave the rest of the trek for another trip.From Faralya I returned to Dalaman, where a final day on the beach refreshed my aching legs and allowed for plenty of time to plan the next visit. Next time, I’m determined to complete the Lycian Way and revisit this spectacular coastline, the blissful beaches and the friendly villages with delicious Mediterranean cuisine.This article was written by Monarch Airlines, who provide regular  flights to Dalaman from a range of UK airports. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/3-of-the-best-turkish-baths-in-istanbul/,3 Of The Best Turkish Baths In Istanbul,Turkey,"Within the last few years Istanbul has gained a reputation as a hub for the hip and happening. Nightclubs are packed, trendy bars are bustling and the restaurants in Istanbul are amongst some of the best in the world.But not all is shiny and new. In fact much of Istanbul’s decadent past remains, including its historic Turkish Baths. A hallmark of the city, the Turkish Baths of Istanbul are still used by locals today, and are a wonderful way to not only relax after a big night out, but experience the old side of Istanbul. But where to begin?Three of the Best Turkish Baths In IstanbulÇemberlitas HamamiCemberlitas is Istanbul’s most visited Turkish bath, also known as a hammam and a great place to visit for tourists who are new to the experience. Its location on Divanyolu Street, surrounded by numerous attractions, makes Cemberlitas an easy resting point after a morning of sightseeing. The hammam itself is also an impressive historical site, dating back as early as 1584. Inside the bath house is a heated marble platform called the sicaklik which is surrounded by bathing basins and private bathing cubicles. The traditional way to enjoy the hammam is to relax and perspire on the hot marble, followed by an exfoliating scrub and rinse in one of the basins. The hammam also offers numerous services catered towards tourists.Tarihi Galatasaray HamamiFor a more traditional bath experience, head to the Tarihi Galatasaray in Beyoglu. When it was built by Sultan Beyazit II in 1481, the hammam was considered more than just a bath but a way of life where locals both rich and poor, men and women, would visit freely. Today the Hammam is still popular with locals, particularly business men. The traditional Tarihi Galatasaray treatment is conducted by a person called a ‘Kesaci’, who begins by dry scrubbing your body using a mitt made of goat hair called a ‘Kesa.’ After the exfoliation, the Kescai will rub you with rich olive oil, followed by a rinse off in a basin of warm water. After drying off, the last treatment is a 20 minute oil massage which takes place outside of the bath house.Haseki Hürrem HamamiLocated between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, The Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamami is the biggest bath house in Istanbul and beloved for its impressive interior. Though built in 1557, the Hammam was abandoned as a bath house for numerous years due to its lack of retaining heat. After being used as a coal-fuel tank and a carpet exhibition venue, in 2007 the spectacular Ottoman building was restored back to its original function. Today the Haseki Hürrem Sultan Hamami retains the original hammam design featuring two baths that are seventy-five meters long each, as well as dome ceilings and grey marble.With flights to Istanbul readily accessible and great value, the city is a metropolis for the cool and cultured. This post was written by Lauren who works for http://www.flightcentre.com.au/flights/product/istanbul Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/small-european-hotels/,Small European Hotels,Turkey,"When I was in Istanbul recently I stayed in two different hotels. The first one was a European style business hotel near Taksim. The second one was a small hotel, Hotel Historia, just behind the Sultanahmet mosque (the blue mosque). The first hotel was wonderful but was probably about twice the price of the second hotel. Neither of the hotels is what Americans would expect from a typical hotel room. A typical American style hotel has two double beds or a king size bed. A typical small European hotel might fit a double bed but there would not be any floor space. More likely you will find smaller twin beds. The rooms are smaller. I noticed with the Hotel Historica that the reviews for the hotel ran from people who loved it to people who hated it. Some of the people who hated it were Americans who I think arrived with the wrong expectations. So what should you expect? These boutique hotels can be a wonderful experience. The hotel Historica was inexpensive. It had an elevator, but you will not always find this in these older hotels which is one of the reasons I like to pack light. The hotel was clean and the people were wonderful. It had high speed internet although not good coverage from my particular hotel room. No problem, it had a nice comfortable lobby which looked more like a living room. As I sat checking my email someone brought over a glass of hot tea. The breakfast was included and was beautiful as well as tasty. The hotel was 2-3 blocks from one of the main sites in the city. Someone did not like this place? I don’t get it.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/layover-tour-in-taipei-taiwan-get-out-of-the-airport-on-long-layovers/,Taipei Layover Tour – How to Spend an 8+ Hour Layover,Taiwan,"Sometimes your travel schedule works like a well-oiled machine. Connecting flights line up with Swiss precision and you move effortlessly from one flight to another without delays… sometimes. But on other trips you get more of a sense that “you can’t get there from here” and you are left waiting for 8 hours between flights.Such was my travel schedule which left me with a scheduled 7 hour 55-minute layover in Taiwan. I had never been to Taiwan. Rather than sit in artificial lighting, eating at the food court and hanging out on airport wi-fi, I arranged a layover tour of Taipei sponsored by Viator (see other private tours in Taipei).Layover  Tour in TaipeiI had never done an organized layover tour before, but the idea seemed simply brilliant. If you have an 8-hour layover or greater this tour plans an itinerary that gets you 45 minutes from the airport, explores some of the major city sites and whisks you back to the airport in time to catch your next flight. The only catch is that you have to be functional after your first flight, in my case a flight scheduled to last 13 hours from San Francisco. I can sleep on planes so I was in great shape (check out my 10 Tips to Combat Jet Lag).My flight arrived earlier than our 6 am estimated arrival time. I cleared customs which I would not have had to do if I had just stayed in the airport, but then again I would not have gotten another stamp in my passport nor would I have counted being in Taiwan. I met my guide Mark Lu and my driver in the arrival area by 6 am.Advantages of a Private TourThe first difference between trying to get into the city on my own and a private tour was obvious from the moment I saw someone holding up a sign with my name on it. I didn’t have to find the city bus or wonder where to go and I started learning about Taiwan on the way into the city. Mark’s command of English was great. He talked about the history of the island as it was colonized in turned by the Spanish, the Dutch, the Chinese, the Japanese, and the Nationalist Chinese. Mark has only been a tour guide for a few years. Previous to that he was an officer in the Taiwanese Navy.Bao’an TempleOne problem with starting a city tour at 6 o’clock in the morning is that many things are run by the government and don’t open up until 9 AM. Fortunately, the Bao’an Temple, which is a UNESCO world heritage site, is privately run and opened at 6 AM. We toured the temple complex as Mark explained to me some of the details of the Taoism religion. The tour normally also includes a stop at the nearby Confucius Temple which opens at 9 am but which was unfortunately closed the day of my visit.Street MarketOur next scheduled stop was the changing of the guard at the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall which happens on the hour starting at 9 am, but we had to kill some time before that. While we waited we toured a local market. I love local markets and particularly local markets in Asia. I don’t always know exactly what people are eating but I love the scene. Motorcycles and pedestrians thread their way down the street which has not yet filled up in this early morning hour.The Grand HotelWe also visited the Grand Hotel, the first international hotel in Taipei. The Grand Hotel was built by Chiang Kai Shek’s 4th wife. It was the tallest building in Taiwan for most of a decade after it was completed in 1973. It is built in the style of a giant pagoda and is imposing. It has 490 rooms, 12 floors, and 3 restaurants. It has been where many foreign dignitaries have been housed over the years. It is built on Yuanshan Mountain on the site where the occupying Japanese had a Shinto shrine in WWII. The front gate is a great photo spot and the top photo on this article was taken there.National Palace MuseumWe saw the outside of the National Palace Museum which holds 696,000 pieces of ancient Chinese imperial art and artifacts collected by the emperors of China over centuries. The museum was originally housed in the Forbidden City in Beijing. The museum collection was moved several times during WWII to keep it out of Japanese hands and then later evacuated to Taiwan with the nationalist Chinese forces after they were defeated by the communists in the Chinese Civil War. The PRC considers that the collection was “stolen” and wants it back.Unfortunately, the museum also does not open until 9 am.Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall – Liberty SquareThe Chiang Kai Shek Memorial Hall sits in Liberty Square. The ground level houses a library and museum The Memorial Hall also houses a museum that interprets the history of China and of Taiwan during the time of Chiang Kai Shek. You can see artifacts like the presidential limousine.To get to the memorial hall you climb 89 steps, one for each year in the life of Chiang Kai Shek. The massive doors of the hall opened at 9 am, ushering in crowds of tourists in time for the ceremonial changing of the guard. The figure of Chiang Kai Shek sits in a large marble chair reminiscent of the Lincoln Memorial. Chiang Kai Shek looked on the guards displayed their proficiency with rifle choreography.The Memorial Hall sits in a large park-like area which also houses the National Theater and National Concert Hall. A children’s choir was singing on the steps of the National Concert Hall during our visit.Presidential Office BuildingWe stopped for a photo at the Presidential Office Building, the Taiwan version of the White House. This Baroque-style building was built during the time of the Japanese occupation for the governor of the island. It became the office of the president when the nationalists fled to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War.Taipei 101We proceeded to Taipei 101, which was the tallest building in the world from 2004-2010 and is still the 9th tallest building. It is still the home of the world’s fastest elevator, which climbs to the observation floor in 25 ear-popping seconds.The view from Taipei 101 was intermittent because of heavy clouds on the day of my visit.Taiwan is a geologically active area so Taipei 101 was built to survive earthquakes as well as the occasional Tsunami. One of the interesting features of the building is hidden inside near the top. It is a large heavy counterweight which is suspended in the inside of the building. This weight helps dampen the movement of the building.Din Tai Fung dumpling restaurantThe final stop of the tour was the famous Din Tai Fung dumpling restaurant in the same complex as Taipei 101. If there had been no view at all from Taipei 101, if there had been no temples open and we had missed the changing of the guard, the entire tour would have been worth it just for the pork soup dumplings alone.Return to the AirportThe return trip to the airport was slowed by an accident on the highway. It made my guide and driver nervous but I let them do the worrying for me. They are, after all, the professionals. And that was really the theme of the tour for me. Not everything went smoothly. Not everything was open the day I was there or at the time I was there. But the entire time I was comparing my experience to what it would have been like if I stayed in the airport.I recognized my seatmate on my flight out of Taiwan as someone who had flown in on the same flight as me from San Francisco. It was her first international trip and she had been afraid to leave the airport. While I was on a tour seeing world-class sites, she was trying to sleep on the airport floor. Mine was the better option.6-Hour Layover Ultimate Taipei City Tour including airport pick up and drop off.US $90Buy Full-day private tour by car and drive around the attractions of your choice.

https://amateurtraveler.com/spending-day-wazungu-arusha-tanzania/,"Spending a Day as Wazungu in Arusha, Tanzania",Tanzania,"“Wazungu”That was the first word of Swahili that Rick learned. As he walked through the crowded marketplace people looked at him and smile then they would point the direction that the other nine of us went and say one word, “wazungu”: white people.Arusha in Northern Tanzania is no stranger to tourists. Many tourists come through the city every year on their way to the famous game parks of Northern Tanzania: Ngorogoro Crater, Lake Manyara, Tarangire and of course Serengeti. But tourists mostly stay in the center of town in comfortable hotels and do not venture out here past where the pavement stops.In the center of town it is easy to meet locals, they are all over the place and they want to sell you something. They desperately want to sell you something. They circle around the ATM machines and tour buses and will gladly sell you their artwork or their crafts in exchange for your new shilingi. They drive a hard bargain and assume “no” means you want to negotiate more, not that you are not interested. Spend an afternoon in downtown Arusha and you get a new found appreciation for what it feels like to be the weakest antelope in the herd.But we had come further out of the downtown than mosts tourists range. The ten of us and our bus driver had visited a local hospital run by the Lutheran church. On the way back from the hospital as we bumped and rattled down the dirt road (“you should have seen them before they fixed them after the last rains”) we stopped at a local market we had seen. Rick went with the bus as it parked and the other nine of us dispersed into the crowd.By dispersed, I mean I headed one way and eight other people followed. I was the only one who had studied any swahili at all and I also could probably find the way back. Granted most of my swahili was contained in the phrase “ninasema kiswahili kidogo” which means “I speak a little Swahili”. That phrase won’t get you very far in a conversation but it did prove to be a great source of amusement with the locals we met. People would light up with surprise and wonder like they found out your dog could talk. When your dog can talk no one criticizes it for having a small vocabulary.Wazungu. White people. It was trivial for Rick to track us. We did not blend in. But this was very different from being downtown. This was not where the tourists shopped. For one thing the prices here were what the locals pay for things. And in a country where school teachers make 3 U.S. dollars a day, that is not that much. For another even though we stood out more we made less of an impact on the rhythm of the place. People smiled or stared but they went on with their buying and selling as they always did.Here a man was selling brightly colored cloth. These pieces of cloth were seconds. Something was not quite right in each of them which made them cheap enough to sell out here. Over there a woman was buying the corn flour she would use to make tonight’s ugali, the ubiquitous porridge-like base for many a meal in East Africa. Some vendors had stalls, like the man selling furniture, but many just had their goods on blankets or tarps on the ground. A group of men played home made drums nearby that provided the sound track. It seems to be difficult to gather a group of 3 or more Tanzanians without producing music of some sort, and probably and inexplicably music in 4 part harmony.One man called to me, “come taste Africa”. He was selling sugar cane. One small 100 shilingi coin (about a twelfth of a U.S. Dollar) would buy a piece long enough for 5 of us to have a piece a bit wider than my fist. But there were 9 of us and I only had one coin that was that small. The man shrugged when we could not come up with another coin and gave us a second piece for free. Something was very different out here where the tourists don’t normally go. The man demonstrated to us another Swahili word. In Swahili the word for strangers is “mgeni”, which is also the word for guests.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/climb-mount-kilimanjaro-as-a-solo-traveler/,Climb Mount Kilimanjaro as a Solo Traveler,Tanzania,"I don’t know exactly when “Climb Mount Kilimanjaro” made it onto my bucket list. However, I am aware of the moment I committed to crossing it off the list. I was dating someone so fearful of life he would only eat the same dish for dinner and considered me insane to suggest doing laundry on a day other than Tuesday. Always being the freedom-loving, travel-obsessed type, ending the relationship was liberating. I craved to do something to commemorate the change. I would trek a mountain.The RisksBy the standards of mountaineering, Kilimanjaro at 19,341 feet is considered ‘very high altitude’, meaning the chances of attitude sickness (vomiting, headaches, fluid accumulation) or death (approximately 1 to 10 annually depending on who you ask) increases with every 1,000 feet. With treks under a week and no technical climbing knowledge needed, it is the most assessable of the Seven Summits climbs. There are only three ways to end a Kilimanjaro trek – successfully summiting, being dragged off the mountain or volunteering to end your trek.PreparationMy training for my Kilimanjaro trek proved to be time-consuming and determination-testing. To minimize the chances of altitude sickness, I focused on elevating my cardiovascular fitness. That meant months of swimming, running 10K races and walking around my home in a not-too-attractive oxygen depriving mask. I also bought Diamox, an altitude sickness medication that causes frequent urination and every over-the-counter medication I could find at my neighborhood pharmacy.My training proved to be the most stable of the preparatory actions. My family’s reactions were varied, from disbelief to full support. My friends’ expression of panic indicated that my trek will be solo.In November 2012, I found myself on a flight to Kilimanjaro airport via Amsterdam to undertake my ‘foolhardy’ attempt. How this would end was anyone’s guess.As a solo trekker, I was given my own guide plus two porters, a cook, and a waiter. I had decided to take the Marangu route. The only route of the six with sleeping huts instead of tents, it is arguably the most luxurious. My belongings (weighing 35 pounds; weight limits are enforced) were either in my daypack or my duffel bag which the porters carried between camps.starting out for the day at HormoboOn the MountainThe Marangu route has four climate zones – rainforest, moorland, alpine desert and ice cap at the summit. Typically the trek takes four days, stopping at the Mandara, Horombo, and Kibo camps respectively. I elected for an acclimatization day at Horombo to increase my chances of summiting.In trekking alone and without a social network, I met people quickly. One such person was a South African woman who I would spend most of my non-trekking time with. She also became my hut roommate (each approximately 300 square feet hut at Mandara and Horombo sleeps four) and Diamox-fueled midnight-search-for-the-outhouse partner. When not sleeping or going to the bathroom we talked about our lives, each of us making disclosures only likely on a mountain in East Africa.sunrise at Mandara camp on yet another trip to the outhouseOtherwise, the treks proved to be physically demanding but not enough to immobilize me the next day. I had no problems with altitude except for the usual shortness of breath. The most physically demanding stretch of trekking was between Mandara and Horombo camps. However, that belief may have been influenced my experiencing a sudden drop in body temperature on that trail. I recovered only after I ingested some water laced with glucose, food and donned an extra jacket I had in my day pack. I believe packing that extra jacket saved my trek.Summit to Uhuru Peak The night before my summit attempt, safely in the co-head sleeping dorm that is Kibo Hut, I gave myself a highly-charged motivational speech. I was caught between wanting to take a long nap and wanting to trek to the summit and “get it over with”. My new mantra of “Let’s Do It” lulled me to sleep. My rest was short, however. Shortly before 12 midnight, my guide woke me up. It was time to get dressed (4 layers for me plus headlamp) and start the summit.dawn at the peakThere are two summit markers on the Marangu route, Gilman’s Point (5 hours trek from Kibo Hut) and Uhuru Peak (1 and 1/2 hours trek from Gilman’s Point). The first hours proved to be unremarkable except for the fatigue of trekking into thinner air. I watched the backs of my guide’s boots, the only thing visible with my headlamp. Occasionally, I would look up to see the outline of a hill. I just need to get over that hill I would tell myself. Each time I seemed to scale a hill, another appeared. I stopped looking up.At exactly 5 o’clock I reached Gilman’s point. This is a significant achievement and a turn-back point for some. Not me. We keep on. Now on snow, my guide led me through tunnels, alleyways, and ledges. Fueled by the promise of making it, I made less rest stops. At exactly 6:30 AM I summited Kilimanjaro. I had done it!me at the summit, tired but happyInsightsAction annihilates apathy. Humans have been attempting to summit mountain peaks for centuries. I realized in my trek that the reason for the attempts is the sense of achievement of conquering something that was previously unconquerable. I scared myself and survived. I pushed my self-imposed limits and succeeded. I scared myself and survived. Today, my confidence heightened, I yearn to undertake another limit-breaking feat. Most of all, I relish in not knowing exactly what my next meal will be and doing laundry on a lazy Sunday morning.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/tanzanian-safari-to-lake-manyara-ngorogoro-crater-and-tarangire/,"Tanzania – Best Safari Destinations (Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater and Tarangire)",Tanzania,"I am sure you think you know what the roar of a lion sounds like. Whether you grew up watching Animal Planet or Wild Kingdom we have all heard the sound. But when the lion is less than 4 feet away there is a deep-seated visceral reaction to that sound like some ancestral voice reminding you “hey buddy, you weren’t always at the top of the food chain”.Encounters like mine with the lion above are common at three very popular game parks in Northern Tanzania. All three are a quick drive from the gateway city of Arusha.Lake ManyaraThe first of the three parks is Lake Mayara. Mayara is a Maasai word for the thorny Acacia tree common in this part of Africa. The elephants and other animals at Lake Manyara are only passing through. Like the rest of the parks, this one has no fences and no borders that the elephants would respect. They come and go from further South in Tanzania to further North in Kenya.The park is visited in a vehicle like a RangeRover with a large hole in the top where around 5 tourists poke their heads out to try and capture the spectacle. A zoom lens is a must and a monopod is recommended. There is no room in the vehicle for a tripod. You won’t get quite close enough to reach out and touch an elephant but you will be able to capture their image like this craggy mud-caked face of a bull elephant.No matter how many times you have seen a giraffe on television, the real thing still seems somewhat improbable if not impossible. These tall “gentle” creatures are a symbol of peace in Tanzania, yet can kick a lion to death if attacked. Lake Mayara hosts the Maasai giraffe. The average male is 17 feet tall. As impossible as it seems they give birth standing up and the drop is what cuts the umbilical cord. A mother giraffe is pregnant for 400-460 days and her baby is 6 feet tall. The baby can walk within hours of birth.Lake Mayara is also home to troupes of baboons. As much as I enjoyed the park I can’t say it seemed vastly different from visiting a wild animal park in the United States.http://traffic.libsyn.com/amtravmp4/amateurtravelervideo-49606-02-11-2007.m4vNgorongoro CraterNgorongoro is where my brain finally came to understand that I was really in Africa. The circular shape of the crater reminded the native Maasai of a cow’s bell and the name comes from the sound a bell makes. Here instead of seeing a few animals as you descend from the rim you see herds of zebras and wildebeests that seem to go on to the horizon.The Maasai are allowed to herd their animals down to the crater but no one is allow to visit after nightfall. The rules of the road are somewhat different in the crater where the wildebeests have the right of way.We saw warthogs, Thompson’s gazelles, hyenas, flocks of flamingos, and pools of hippos. As we were watching one cheetah mother walk through the grass it scared up a rabbit, which it quickly chased down for dinner. They take this circle of life thing very serious in Ngorongoro. It was one more reminder that this is not a zoo. These are wild animals. We saw the endangered “white” rhino in the distance. There are no more than a dozen rhinos in the park. The people in our party, as well as the nearby vehicles, seemed subdued by the knowledge that we might be viewing an animal that may soon disappear in the wild.Throughout the crater, we bounced along on the dirt roads. The braver or more foolhardy road standing up as we tried to spot the more elusive wildlife. Slowly we turned the color of the dusty roads except for beaming white smiles.It was not until after lunch that we finally saw the lions. The picture above is not a lion that was hit by a car but a sleepy lion that decided to take a nap wrapped around the tire of one unfortunate Range Rover. The occupants were trapped until the lion decided to wake. Unfortunately, a male lion sleeps 20 hours a day and the Range Rover was still parked there the last I saw.TarangireOur final stop is Tarangire. Frankly, after Ngorongoro, Tarangire was a bit anti-climactic. We saw more elephants, more giraffes, and more zebras, but Tarangire does not offer as many vast landscapes as Ngorongoro.Tarangire also is the home to lions, monkeys, ostriches, and leopards. A leopard would be the only one of the so-called “big 5” that we did not see. The big 5 are leopards, lions, elephants, rhinos, and Cape buffalo and were considered the most dangerous of the African animals to hunt on foot. For those of us hunting with a lens instead of a rifle, the leopard is the most elusive of this group as it is a nocturnal and solitary hunter. We did spot where a leopard had stored its kill up in the branches of a tree.The best feature of this park is that, unlike Ngorongoro, you can eat (or sleep) at the lodge in the park. Get a seat on the veranda where you can watch the elephants migrating. Get a cold Tusker beer and a great tasting hamburger and tell yourself. “I’m top of the food chain now”.ConclusionA wildlife safari in Africa is a once in a lifetime experience. Getting to Africa is expensive and time-consuming for those of us in the Northern hemisphere, but the experience is amazing. No zoo experience will ever compare. If you are a photographer or just someone who loves wildlife, add Northern Tanzania to your bucket list.LogisticsThe easiest way to visit all three parks is to arrange a tour with a local guide. I used JMTours out of Arusha that booked a 2 and a half-day outing including 2 nights in a safari lodge for a reasonable price.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/intro-to-learning-swahili/,Intro to Learning Swahili,Tanzania,"This week’s Amateur Traveler podcast was on traveling to Zanzibar in Tanzania.

https://amateurtraveler.com/dark-tourism-europe/,10 Dark Tourism Destinations in Europe,Ukraine,"Netflix’s latest hit has seriously put ‘dark tourism’ on the map with search results in the UK increasing by a whopping 1000 per cent since it launched!What is Dark Tourism?Dark tourism is defined as “tourism directed to places that are identified with death and suffering”. Dark tourism places run from the macabre like the site a shipwreck to the somber like a concentration camp to the truly weird like a festival of near-death experiences.If you’d prefer to explore for yourself rather than just ‘Netflix and Chill’ We Are Promotional has created the ultimate list of dark tourism sites and macabre attractions. So forget your beach towel and pack the tissues as we take you on the REAL tour of Europe – the one that’s not in the guidebooks!We present 10 dark tourism destinations for your next Europe trip: Costa Concordia Shipwreck, ItalyType: ShipwreckLocation: Isola del Giglio, ItalyClosest Airport: Milan“It’s just like Titanic!” cried a survivor of the Costa Concordia tragedy not long after it occurred.Yes and no. Both were tragedies and both were cruise ships, but the Titanic sinking in 1912 killed 1,517 people, and then was relatively forgotten about by the public. The only reason everyone knows about it today is because of the famous movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio.The Costa Concordia, on the other hand, took fewer lives and has not been forgotten about. After the tragedy, immediately, memorials and exhibitions were put up and many locals were pleased by the newfound industry in the town – tourism.Costa Concordia was a cruise ship that had 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board when it crashed on 13th January 2012. The ship hit an underwater rock off the waters off the coast of Tuscany near Isola del Giglio.The ship was only so close to the coast because of a foolish attempt by, Francesco Schettino, the captain, to perform a ‘sail by salute’ – the practice of sailing close by to an island for the interest of passengers and crew.The impact caused two long strips of steel from the ship’s hull to be shredded resulting in water entering the hull. The ship then capsized and the disaster claimed the lives of 32 passengers.Today you can visit the rusted and battered remains of the cruise ship by boat. Locals run hour-long tours on zodiacs that leave from Genoas old harbour and take you within 200 yards of the morbid spectacle.Image – Photography is not allowed on the site so this is an old US army image. Babenhausen Barracks, GermanyType: WW2 BarracksLocation: Hessen, GermanyClosest Airport: Frankfurt (FRA)You can’t mention morbid locations in Europe without bringing up something in relation to its darkest time in modern history – WW2.Dark tourism has lead to a rise in the number of visitors to various WW2 sites across Europe with Auschwitz seeing over 2 million visitors in 2016 but if you’re looking for something a little less crowded and a little more out there check out the Babenhausen Barracks in Germany.The barracks used to house soldiers but fell into disrepair after WW2, but a section of them has now been turned into a museum. The reason they make the list of dark tourism hotspots in Europe is that there are frequent reports of paranormal activity at the barracks.Nothing will raise the hairs on your arms quite like a good ghost story and Babenhausen Barracks has a great one. When you get there you may get a fright as you hear German voices coming from the basement shouting commands to their officers.Lights in the building have been known to turn off and on by themselves so be sure you bring a flashlight with you.German soldiers have been seen strolling the halls in their military uniforms and soldiers who have visited the site even report picking up a telephone in the barracks and hearing a woman’s voice “speaking backwards” – no one is able to make out what she is saying. Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceType: Post-war Ghost-town/Memorial MuseumLocation: Oradour-sur-Glane, FranceClosest Airport: LimogesA visit to Oradour-sur-Glane in France is a truly moving experience but you could expect nothing less from a village that was entirely wiped out by the Nazi SS forces in June of 1944.On June 10th 1994 the war was drawing to a close, Allied troops had just stormed the beaches in Normandy, completing the largest seaborne invasion in history and changing the course of the war.The majority of Europe had hope – there was an end in sight for the war. But just as these celebratory events were happening, a tragedy occurred in the small French village of Oradour-sur-Glane.Men, women and children in the village were rounded up by the Waffen SS and massacred. 642 people were killed – some asphyxiated, some machine-gunned and some burnt alive.The women and children were rounded up and held in the local church which the SS locked and set on fire. Today if you enter the church you can still see a flattened pushchair, left in its place where it had been found before the altar.Stepping into the village is like stepping through time. All the remains have been left where they were found as a reminder of the tragedy that happened here and as a warning of the atrocities that happen in war.The events are still shrouded in mystery. No one knows why this small town was chosen to experience this ultimate horror – theories of Russian gold and revenge killings still remain controversial and we may never know why this poor settlement was chosen.“Everyone should come here once in their life. Deeply moving, well preserved and respectful tribute to a truly terrible action and time.”(Tripadvisor, 2018) Overtoun Suicide BridgeType: Celtic mythological siteLocation: Dumbarton, ScotlandClosest Airport: GlasgowNear the quiet and peaceful village of Milton in Scotland, there is a mysterious bridge. For reasons unknown, this bridge has been attracting suicidal dogs since the 1960’s.If you’ve ever owned a dog you probably realise why this is such a strange occurrence – you’re probably thinking ‘I didn’t even know dog suicide was a thing.’ According to most people and canine psychologist Dr. David Sands, it’s not, making the fact that an estimated 50 dogs have taken their lives here even weirder.Witnesses have seen a number of dogs plummet to a gruesome death from the same spot on the bridge. The canines meet a tragic end landing on rocks 50 feet (15m) below, most dying on impact.What is even stranger than and adds to the theory that these are suicides rather than freak accidents is that on occasion these dogs can be seen climbing the parapet wall before they make their jump. Some dogs are even so lucky as to survive their brush with death only to return to the bridge and attempt the second jump.The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has even gone so far as to send investigators to the bridge to determine the cause of these dogs suicides. They were also unable to explain the cause of this bizarre behaviour.‘Animals are hyper-sensitive to the spirit world, but I didn’t feel any adverse energy.’ (Psychic Mary Armour) The Festival of Near Death ExperiencesType: Celebration of life/FestivalLocation: As Nieves, Pontevedra, SpainClosest Airport: Vigo via MadridThere are a lot of bizarre and strange festivals in the world but none may be quite as strange as the Festival of Near Death Experiences held in the small village of As Nieves, Spain every July.The festival of near-death experiences – or the Fiestas de Santa Marta de Ribarteme as the locals call it – is home to all manner of weird and wonderful events and activities. Burning effigies, running with bulls, tomato fights and wine battles are just some of the fun events a day at this festival will hold in store.People from all over, who have had a near-death experience, will make the long journey to this remote Spanish village with their friends and family. Once they arrive they are put into coffins and play dead. Their family then carries their coffin through the local streets along with a procession of mourners.The collection of strange processions then meet at the cemetery of the local church – The Church of Santa Marta de Ribarteme. Prayers are said to Saint Marta and everyone gives thanks for their lives and that they were saved from death by presenting a gift (usually money) to the Saints statue.“It is a very important day for my family and other families – I remember my mother and my pledge to her and the doctor who saved my life.”(The Irish Times, 2016) Pripyat, UkraineType: Nuclear disasterLocation: Pripyat, UkraineClosest Airport: Kiev-ZhulhanyIn the north of Ukraine, you will find the town Pripyat where the Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened in 1986. A horrific disaster turned tourist attraction, Pripyat now attracts over 10,000 visitors a year.On April 25 1986, during a late night safety test there was simulated station power blackout. The safety systems were intentionally turned off for the test but due to a number of flaws in the reactor design and human error, the nuclear reactor exploded.It was the worst nuclear power plant explosion in history realising huge quantities of radioactive material into the earth’s atmosphere. Two people were killed during the explosion and over the coming weeks and months, the full repercussions of the explosion would be realised.237 servicemen, firemen and employees were diagnosed with acute radiation sickness of which 31 died within the first 3 months. In the greater population, men, women and children developed cancer, deformities and had symptoms of acute radiation sickness.To this day, the full human impact of Chernobyl is unknown. The estimates differ significantly with some saying the number of people affected tops a million. After this event and the tragic consequences that are still being felt today, no one ever expected it to become a tourist attraction.Today, the Ukrainian government allows tourists to take short and regulated visits 30 miles into the exclusion zone and into the abandoned town of Pripyat.Tens of thousands of people were evacuated from the town during the Chernobyl explosion, homes, schools and even an amusement park were left behind to decay. Untouched by humans since their evacuation, stepping into this town is like stepping into a post-apocalyptic movie.The ghost town is like a freeze frame form the soviet-era, with communist propaganda hanging from the walls and hammer and sickles stuck to notice boards and streetlamps. As you walk through the town you will get the feeling that you are frozen in time as all the clocks have stopped at 11:55 – the moment that power was cut to the town.“This was a highlight of four months of travel through Central Asia and Eastern Europe! Seeing the nuclear power plant and the nearby Duga Soviet radar system was really cool. Visiting Pripyat, in particular, was something completely different and will stay with me.”read more at 10 Reasons Why Chernobyl Tours Are the Best Dark Tourism Experience(Tripadvisor 2018) Vilnius, LithuaniaType: MuseumLocation: Vilnius, LithuaniaClosest Airport: VilniusUntil 1991, Vilnius, Lithuania was home to a full operation KGB headquarters and prison.Nowadays it has been converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims showing exhibits to educate visitors about the repression of Lithuanian citizens under Soviet rule, including the deportations to Siberian gulags.Both the German Gestapo and the KGB have operated within the building committing and planning numerous atrocities. For most people, the events that happened in Lithuania under the rule are unfamiliar as it is not a thing that is taught in Western Europe so there is no better place to go and learn that this useful and educational museum.Over 75,000 Lithuanians disappeared during the Soviet rule with gulags, and others put in prison or executed. There was extensive exploitation of natural resources by the communist government and a number of Lithuanians attempted to resist the government and form a rebellion but the KGB was quick to round up, torture and kill anyone with reported links to rebel activity.The museum includes a basement with KGB prisons cells and an execution room showing visitors some of the ghastly elements of this extremely dark site. Political prisoners, as well as local Lithuanians were interrogated and tortured here with over 1,000 victims being killed in their execution room.Some of the basement cells are completely preserved, not having changed a bit since they were last operational in 1991 giving the museum true authenticity.“This museum provides insight in KGB ways of working. Chilling. It also is an ode to the many brave Lithuanian partizans. For decades they fought for their freedom which finally came after the 1989 Singing Revolution. I learned so much.”(Tripadvisor 2018) Troubles Tours, Northern IrelandType: City TourLocation: Belfast, Northern IrelandClosest Airport: BelfastNow known as the Emerald of Ireland, Belfast was once associated more with gruesome than green.For years, from the sixties well into the late nineties, no one wanted to step foot in Belfast due to ‘The Troubles.’ Now, in post-Troubles Belfast, tourists flock to the streets to learn about the brutal history of the IRA.‘The Troubles’ refers to the period of time in Belfast where nationalists and unionists were in conflict. This conflict, often described as a guerrilla war, was ended in 1998 by the Good Friday Agreement.Today you can get a black taxi tour of the city where you will be driven to various areas of significance during the troubles. From political murals the Falls and the Shankill which show their own graphic tale of the Troubles of Northern Ireland to the peace line that was used to keep nationalists and unionists apart during these times and lead to further division among the communities.You can also get a tour of Crumlin Road Jail and Court House. This old Victorian building played a significant role in ‘The Troubles.’ It is the place where many people involved in the war were convicted, imprisoned and even executed. In these courthouses the true stories of many bombing, killings and tortures came to light and children were even once held within its cells.“The visit to Crumlin Road Jail gave us a real feeling of what it was like to be in prison in the 19th century. It also includes a sobering and informative look at the execution cell and all that happened there. Not for the nervous sort.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Pompeii, ItalyType: Archeological siteLocation: Pompeii, ItalyClosest Airport: NaplesPompeii has been famed for centuries for its volcanic eruption in 79AD that left the entire city in ruin. It is probably one of the oldest dark sites in Europe and although the term ‘dark tourism’ was coined fairly recently, people have been making the voyage to see the destroyed city for centuries.An important site for archaeologists or anyone interested in history, the site is the largest and most well preserved Roman town. The very reason the ancient city was preserved so well is the same reason it became a dark tourism spot – the covering of ash it got the night of the disastrous eruption of Mt Vesuvius.The site lay covered in ash but was discovered in the 18th Century and has since held a draw for those interested in the grim and gruesome. In the archaeological dig of the site, a number of both glorious and grousoume discoveries have been made from beautiful mosaics to perfectly preserved human bodies.The bodies are the main draw for many dark tourists – seeing perfectly preserved roman citizens as they try to flee the eruption, displaying the last agonizing moments of Pompeii is a once in a lifetime opportunity.A number of the bodies on display within the site are actually made from plaster and come from the “Alley of Skeletons.” One of the streets in Pompeii had several air pockets in it that were the outlines of human remains so archaeologists poured plaster into the voids and waited for it to harden revealing victims contorted in various positions as they try to shield themselves from volcanic lava and ash.“This place is amazing; you can really imagine how it was to live in Ancient Rome. Incredible remains that have been preserved so well. Beautiful mosaics. Amazing cobbled streets.”(Tripadvisor 2018) The Battle of the Somme, FranceType: BattlefieldLocation: Somme, FranceClosest Airport: ParisAs soon as someone mentions The Battle of the Somme, in your mind, you immediately conjure up the bloody images of a World War 1 battlefield. At this spot, three million soldiers of about 20 nationalities fought along 45km of land.The battle was fought between 1st July and 1st November in 1916 close to the Somme River in France. It is one of the bloodiest battles in history with 57,000 British troops dying on the first day alone.Today and forever the Somme will be scarred by the great battle that took place here. You can take a walking tour along the battlefield and see many of the trenches still in place as well as walk among the cemeteries and memorials put up in the area for all those who died there.The landscape tells the story of the battle as explosions, ruins, and shell holes mark the land. The Lochnagar Crater is the only remaining mine hole that you can visit on the Western Front and it is quite a sight at 91m in diameter and 21m deep.You can also visit Historial de la Grande Guerre along the riverfront at the town of Peronne. It is home to an extensive ray of trilingual exhibitions which include loads of interactive media and are thought-provoking and educational.“I learnt so much and saw how so many died there and so many classed as ‘missing’ in unmarked graves. A part of history we should not forget and never let happen again.”(Tripadvisor 2018)Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/kiev-ukraine-travel/,"Kiev, Ukraine – Under The Radar Destination",Ukraine,"In the late 80s and early 90s, we watched as a 40 year-cold-war came to an end. The Iron Curtain came down. The Soviet Union collapsed and the Soviet sphere of influence disappeared. For the first time since the 40s tourists were allowed to travel to countries, they had only heard about. Many of these countries and cities have become top 25 tourist destinations such as Budapest and Prague. Others are just as spectacular but don’t receive the same attention, or the same amount of tourists. Foremost among these under-the-radar-post-cold-war destinations is Kiev, Ukraine.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}AttractionsWhere Recent History Was MadeSoviet MonumentsThings to doNightlifeThe ArtsLodgingThe PeoplePodcastAs far as the population within city limits, Kiev is the 7th largest city in Europe. It was founded around the 6th century AD. Over the next 400 years, it grew in power until it was the most powerful European civilization around the 10th through the 12th centuries. The kingdom finally collapsed with the invasion of the Mongols. It was the Kievan Rus empire that managed to prevent them from driving into the heart of Europe, but the victory was costly and the empire never recovered. It is the history and architecture from this period and the Soviet Era monuments that make Kiev a special place to visit.AttractionsFor travelers going to The Ukraine, everything should be centered around the Maidan. The Maidan to Kiev is like Times Square in New York City. The Maidan is not only the main tourist center of Ukraine It is also the political center where most of the government offices are centered in a short radius around the plaza. All the subway lines intersect underneath the Maidan, making it the transportation hub also. During times of political turmoil, all these factors make the Maidan a haven for protests, such as the recent 2013-2014 Winter-on-Fire revolution.Where Recent History Was MadeFor people who follow world events, the allure of the Maidan cannot be overlooked. During the Winter On Fire Revolution, the majority, of the world, watched as protesters in the Maidan overthrew their government. People who look closely will recognize the large pillar with the angel on top and the arch on which is the arch Michael, When I was there, I saw the memorials which had been set up around the square, dedicated to the protesters who lost their lives. Should the current conflict, in the east, snowball into something much greater, future history books will mention this is where it all started.Old World ChurchesSt. Sophia’s Cathedral, an 11th-century church, has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. However, many portions still remain intact. In one corner someone has chipped away the reconstruction of the room to its original 11th-century materials. The interior is decorated with magnificent mosaics and frescoes, created by Byzantine masters. The only place where pictures are allowed, is on the second floor, in front of a mosaic made out of eggs. Originally it was an Orthodox church, in the present day it is not used for religious services.St. Michael’s is another church located just minutes from the Maidan. St. Michaels is a functioning orthodox monastery only a few blocks away from St. Sophia’s Cathedral. Elements of St Michaels date back before the Mongol invasion. It has been destroyed and rebuilt numerous times since its construction in the eleventh century. It has numerous bells in the tower. All of the bells have been rung at the same time only twice. Once when the Mongols invaded and the second time during the Winter-on-Fire revolution in 2013 and 2014.St Andrews another Orthodox church is much more modern than the other two churches. It was designed and built in the mid-1700s. Unlike St Michael’s and St. Sophia’s, St Andrews domes are dark green. Its location sits halfway down the hill, overlooking the Podil district of Kiev. It was originally built to be a private church for the Russian Empress, Elizabeth.Pechersk Lavra is a large Orthodox Christian monastery located in Kiev. The walled complex covers more than 2 and a half million square feet. There are numerous gold-domed religious structures, including a bell tower that is visible from many parts of Kiev. The biggest attraction are the caves beneath the complex, where several saints rest in a mummified state.Soviet MonumentsMost of the time when you approach Kiev from Borispol airport, you are greeted by the Rodina Mat. The Rodina Mat is also known as The Motherland Monument. It is a 203 ft tall stainless steel statue. In one hand the statue holds a sword and in the other hand, it holds a shield that displays the state emblem of the Soviet Union. Measurements, including the base, make the statue a total of 335 feet tall, taller than the Statue of Liberty which is a total of 305 feet tall.The Rodina Mat is only one part of a greater monumental area. It is the biggest attraction at the Museum of The History of Ukraine in World War II, Kiev. The entire Museum features Soviet-era tanks, rocket launchers and boats that were used during WWII. Large 3D murals spring to life and give visitors an insight into the Ukrainian people before, during and after WWII. One of the best photo ops in the area are the two tanks crossing barrels. The tanks are continually painted different colors and are available for people to climb on or pose for pictures.Things to doTour Chernobyl and PripyatA ninety-minute drive, outside of Kiev, is one of the most tragic stories to ever take place during the Soviet Era. On April 26th, 1986 a nuclear power plant exploded and released large quantities of radioactive particles into the air. There have only been two disasters of this level to ever take place. The other was Fukushima, Japan in 2011. Much of the success Japan had in containing their meltdown was what was learned from Chernobyl.Pripyat was the closest city to the power plant. Today, it could be considered the world’s largest ghost town. Photos of Pripyat have been circling the internet lately and people’s interest in Pripyat has increased. You are not allowed to visit Pripyat on your own, but there are several guide services with most prices starting around $150. The price includes transportation from Kiev, a guided tour of all the most important parts and lunch.Tours do give you the option of renting a personal Geiger Counter. I wouldn’t recommend renting one because the guides have them, or someone in the group will rent one. Before you depart Kiev, a guide will show you the radiation level inside the city. During the tour, you will often be shown the Geiger Counter readings. With the exceptions of a few small hot spots, tourists are subject to more radiation in their homes, than they are in Chernobyl, and even the hottest spots in Chernobyl, have less radiation than one would experience on a typical flight. To ensure the tourist’s safety, a series of checkpoints are set up to check the tourists for radiation.Chernobyl is, near the top, for interesting tourist destinations. However, don’t wait until the last moment to schedule your tour, because all visitors need to be pre-screened and approved by the Ukrainian military.NightlifeLike most large European cities, Kiev has a very vibrant nightlife. Nightclubs and bars are within walking distance of most major hotels and the Maidan. The Vodka Bar is in the center of Maidan and is located underneath a large pillar.The ArtsLike most former Soviet States, Kiev has a large emphasis on the arts. There is almost always a ballet, or opera showing in the Taras Shevchenko National Opera and Ballet Theatre of Ukraine. The theatre is not only beautiful on the inside but also on the outside. If you are staying in the Maidan area, it is within walking distance.LodgingHotels in Kiev are really expensive. Most of the things you will want to see and do are within walking distance of the Maidan, which is the city center. The hotels in this area rent for as much as $350 a night. I have had great luck using Airbnb. The most recent time I was there, I found an immaculate apartment for $100 a night. Great apartments, in the area, can be found for as little as $35 a night. This is one destination where you want to skip the hotel.If you do choose a hotel, stay in the Hotel Ukraine. It has been fully remodeled and features a beautiful view of the main city center. It was originally built in 1961 on the spot where Ukraine’s first skyscraper was built. It has received many awards such as “Best Hotel in Ukraine”, and “Leader of the Industry”.The PeopleKievans and Ukrainians, in general, are a peculiar people. For years, the Ukrainian woman have been swept away by foreign men. Often considered as one of the countries with the most beautiful women, mail order bride services target Ukraine more than any other country. Many women approach western men with a degree of skepticism.At a first glance, the people of Ukraine seem cold and unwelcoming. This is most likely a result of growing up and being raised in a Soviet State, where your best friend could be spying on you. They like to keep to themselves and it gives westerners the appearance of coldness. However, if you can be open and friendly, you will learn that the Ukrainians are a very kind and welcoming people. Just don’t expect them to be friendly first.One of the best things about vacations is going someplace where other people haven’t, and finding your own destinations. Some destinations are so diluted, that people don’t ask questions or want to hear stories. Kiev is not one of those destinations.PodcastTo learn more about Kiev listen to episode 581 of the Amateur Traveler podcast Travel to Kiev, Ukraine:Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/4-terrifying-places-in-europe/,4 Scariest Places in Europe,Ukraine,"People always tend to go on and on about the hundreds of marvelous destinations as well as the many romantic getaways ideal for a holiday with your beloved one. However, since I’m more of a solo traveler, I love to travel alone, so these romantic places are of pretty much no interest for me. On the other hand, being an avid backpacker, I’ve pretty much covered all the places that are worth visiting in my home Europe. That is why, I started thinking about something along the lines of the unusual. Not the average traveling ideas you can find in all guidebooks. And then, I finally got it! Since I’m going to be on my own, why not find some places where I can be scared out of my wits?I’m usually into extraordinary types of adventures and, being a big fan of horror movies, consider myself not easily scared. That is what actually made me embark on a journey to visit the top four most terrifying places in Europe. However, note that some of the places are not particularly scary. What actually makes them give you chills down the spine is the mystery and legends they are shrouded in.1. Catacombs of ParisI decided the first stop of my horror journey to be France and to gradually advance east. That’s why my first destination was the Catacombs of Paris. Filled with genuine human skulls and bones, the Catacombs have been created in the eighteenth century. It is basically situated under the city center streets. I had been to Paris before but never have I given it much of a thought what is there under my feet.What led to the ‘building’ of the Catacombs is the fact that the Parisian cemetery that had been used for nearly ten centuries became a source of infection and got many people seriously sick. Therefore, in 1786 the removal of the bones was performed.Nowadays, the Catacombs are an alternative tourist attraction where you can walk around the maze-like corridors along with the remains of about six million Parisians. I definitely found the place worth the visit, especially if you have nerves of steel and the sight of millions of human bones doesn’t make you nauseated.2. AuschwitzNow, the next one really made me shiver. The Auschwitz concentration camp. We have all seen movies about World War II and archive footage of the so-called ‘camps of death’, but experiencing everything firsthand gives you a whole different feeling than watching it on film.The Auschwitz concentration camp is situated in Southern Poland. It consists of hundreds of wood-houses where, during the Second World War, German Nazis would keep hundreds of thousands of Jews, gypsies and others who they considered ‘inferior’.Walking around these places, where people literally starved and toiled to death gave me a feeling I had never experienced before. The grimmest one you can imagine. Millions of people were executed in these camps. Those interested can now enter the grounds of the camp and, while following an expert guide, explore this terrifying place. I took advantage of that opportunity, and I strongly advise you to do so, too, because having a guide contributes to the better understanding of what had been happening there. The very thought of it can scare you stiff.3. Bran CastleBran Castle is one of the places I had in mind when mentioning sites that are shrouded in mystery and legends. Located in the Transylvania province in Central Romania, near the city of Brasov, the Bran Castle is known to have been home to the infamous Vlad the Impaler, also known as Count Dracula. Now, this is something that cannot be proved for sure, but it is widely claimed.This historic figure made famous by Bram Stoker’s novel is known to have been very strict and to have impaled criminals for even the smallest felony. This led to the belief that he was blood-thirsty and that is why he was portrayed the way he was in the aforementioned novel.Precisely because of these legends, I literally consider the castle to be one of the creepiest places one can visit. Especially if you have seen the movie or have read the novel, like myself, you will constantly look behind your back scared that a vampire might appear silently from one of the dark and narrow passages. As if century-old castles aren’t spooky enough in the first place.4. PrypiatThe last site is really different from all the rest and quite unusual. Not a specific ‘attraction’ but rather a whole town, Prypiat is an abandoned town, the one which is closest to the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. It has been uninhabited since 1986 when the Nuclear Disaster took place. Prypiat used to be home to the hundreds of workers and scientists that worked in the factory. However, due to the extremely high levels of radioactivity, all people were moved from the town.Nowadays, the levels of radioactivity have dropped significantly in comparison to 1986, and the place is basically safe to visit, but with a guide. Since I was on my own, I had to join a group of fellow travelers in order to be able to visit the radioactive ground. After the Chernobyl disaster, Prypiat was cleared of its inhabitants, everything was left intact and up to this day stays where it has been once left – household furniture, everyday items, even the nursery’s beds, and an amusement park’s bumper cars and Ferris wheel are still there. I felt like an intruder in some ghost town.

https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-a-weak-american-in-russia-and-ukraine-by-walter-parchomenko/,Book Review: “A Weak American in Russia and Ukraine” by Walter Parchomenko,Ukraine,"The phrase “A Weak American in Russia and Ukraine” I thought was a joke.  How can anyone be weak traveling to Eastern Europe?  That’s not possible!  After reading these short stories by Walter Parchomenko of comical personal adventures, frightful current statistics and embarrassment reducing hints, I sadly concur that most Americans I know, including myself, may be classified as a weak and overly privileged American.Parchomenko’s memoir is an almost unbelievable, yet invaluable, painfully honest guide for those interested in navigating minefields, also known as cities, adjusting to the customs of copious vodka consumption, lending itself to alcoholism or how to maneuver the supermarket in foot candy stilettos.  He lends practical advice, wisdom and unabashedly laughable experiences that could be shared from any parent wanting to shield their child from being taken advantage of or travel agent attempting to protect themselves by informing the traveler to pack wisely because they really are going to visit a third world country.He has a writing sense of humor like Bill Bryson and gives Rick Steves a howling stray dog avoiding, sidewalk leaping, non water resistant “Slovak lightweight thatched shoes with countless tiny holes” jaunt for his rubles.  Reading of the “rootin-tootin, Poutin’s” and Ukraine’s culture of consistent stealing, cheating, bribing and poverty is appalling.  A government that requires one to bring their own medical supplies to the hospital blows my mind.  Living or traveling to these countries would certainly be an adjustment for the “average” American.  The statistics Parchomenko provided are current and astonishing.  94%, yes, 94% of Ukraine’s mortality in 2009 was related to alcohol, smoking and traffic accidents.  Turning down a cigarette with a friend is blasphemy and wearing a seatbelt is an insult to the Slavic Formula-1 drivers who think pedestrians are speed bumps.  He explains why one should treasure a loaf of bread, learn to enjoy Salo and accept gifts of food as a guest.  His true anecdotes about lack of hot water in the ticking time bomb apartments, common, yet appalling sex trade for a better life in America where “squat stalls” are a rarity, police corruption and atrocious government that values the World Cup more than their population growth is incredibly eye opening.This book, I dare say, was better than a travel guide on attractions to visit, where to dine and the public transportation system.  It is a survival guide.  It is a truthful account of why Slavs live in the moment, even though they are chronically tardy.  I know if I ate Borscht, my spoon would have kerplunked soup over the pages, countless times because of drollness and bleakness.  Reading a collection of travel anecdotes about living in a country that is not mine is a reminder that I am fortunate to live in America.  I have clean water available, a savings account and the option to say no to smokers.  I am curious how Russia won the bid for the 2014 Olympics.  I have speculations.  Those will be tales to read another day. Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/uruguay-vacation/,Why You Should Vacation in Uruguay,Uruguay,"“We came for 2 days and ended up extending to 5,” (Jill and Naomi) and “We’re already booked to go to Chile otherwise we’d love to spend more time here.” (Dan and Clem)During our travels in Uruguay we’ve run into all kinds of people from all kinds of places and they usually share two things in common: the first, right from the get go they never intended to spend much time in Uruguay. Why? The biggest reason we’ve heard people cite is there just isn’t any information about Uruguay so people have no idea what’s here until they get here. It’s a place on the trail that connects Chile, Argentina and Brazil and it’s used as a stop off on the way.What’s the second thing they share in common? They wish they’d planned to stay for longer.Why do 99% of people never consider Uruguay as a place for their next vacation?One of many adventure we’ve had in Uruguay… learning to ride gaucho styleOk. We don’t know if it’s exactly 99% but it certainly seems that way when we ask people what they think. In truth, for the vast majority, the first question is, “Where’s Uruguay?” followed quickly by, “But why would I go there?”It’s true that Uruguay doesn’t share any of the superlative experiences that its neighbours have to offer. There are no Andes, no glaciers, no rainforest, and no indigenous people. But don’t let that fool you into thinking there’s nothing here. There is. And it’s why the 1% are smiling.So why do the 99% make the 1% smile?“Ssshhh,” said Sarah with a glint in her eye. She tapped the side of her nose and then beckoned for me to follow her round the corner. She reached up, cupped her hands around my ear and then whispered quickly, all the time keeping an eye out for anyone who might disturb our tête-à-tête. When she finished we grinned wickedly and I promised to keep the secret.And that’s exactly why the 1% smile. If you’ve already found Uruguay and discovered what it has to offer, it’s just like having one of those great big secrets you used to have as a kid. It feels good and you’re in a pretty exclusive club. You’re in the know when everyone else is simply not seeing what’s right in front of their eyes. And yes, you smile.What makes Uruguay such a good travel secret?Like we said, it’s not because Uruguay has the biggest or the best of things. That’s not what’s it about. In fact, Uruguay is small when you compare her to her neighbours. No. It’s her personality and character that make her worth a visit. And once you find her, she has a way of getting under your skin.Miguel and Monica are great and they run a fantastic little posada called El GalopeIt starts with the people. They’re an incredibly friendly bunch who will happily spend the time of day with you if you’re willing to say hello. Do you need great Spanish to appreciate this aspect of Uruguay? Well sure, it helps if you do, but we don’t and we’ve managed just fine. In our broken sentences and limited vocabulary we’ve managed to hold a 2 hour conversation with a lovely lady and her son from San Gregorio who got chatting with us on a local bus. They invited us back to their house for lunch where we also met her husband, and within 4 hours we’d made some new friends in a way we never expected. And this is just one of many similar experiences we’ve had while we’ve been here.Then there’s lots and lots of greenIf you love the countryside and wide open spaces, Uruguay is a great location. Outside the main cities there’s mile upon mile of fields, trees, and traditional agricultural business. The roads are relatively empty compared to anywhere else we’ve been so you can enjoy the scenery as it rolls out before you. If you fancy driving, a weekday run on one of the main National Rutas will see cars passing you in the opposite direction maybe once every 2 or 3 minutes… if that.And besides green, there’s beachFancy a romantic moment anyone?An even bigger surprise is the coastline. It’s endless. Or at least it seems that way. There’s the choice of hip and trendy beaches where the rich and famous hang out in high season. Or, if you prefer, find your own private beach from one of the many that line this 200km coastline. It really is up to you.Last but not least, don’t forget the local cultureWhat does local Uruguayan culture involve? Start with food and a traditional parilla meal. Move on to a local vineyard for a taste of the Tannat grape. Then think about a visit to a local estancia for a gaucho experience you won’t forget. Add in Carnaval and other local festivals and there’s plenty to keep you occupied.So the next time you’re thinking about where to go for your next holiday, remember to think Uruguay… and be one of the 1% walking round with a big secret smile on your face ; )Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/more-to-see-in-uruguay/,"What to see in Montevideo, Uruguay and Beyond",Uruguay,"I enjoyed the podcast about Uruguay. Having lived there for 14 months and vacationed there several times, she did a wonderful job on the review of the country.  If you will allow me, let me highlight a few things.First:  She was exactly right when she said they are a very warm and open country.   If you just say “hello” they will talk to you for hours.  They love just spending time with people and showing off their country.  I have often found in my travels that as people have less, they are more.   There is a shared commonality in the struggle of life.As a background:In the late 1970’s Uruguay had a military coupe and everyone suffered greatly under the regime.  In1981-82 they had a transition from a military dictatorship to a “puppet” democracy; then a few years later a full democracy.  During those years, everyone was somber and oppressed.  The dressed in dull colors, walked around sadly and struggled with life.  Some of this still lingers in their souls today.  The government routinely tortured their people and it was not uncommon to see military personnel with guns standing at corners.  You learned to “not see” anything.  It has taken them many years to get over the fear and doom.  During 80’s, there were many high points.In the fall of 1982, during the inauguration of the president in 1982, they had their first full day of color television.  People for months before time stood outside tv stores and gazed in amazement at the marvel.   Electronics dazzled people.   Even in the poorest sections of town (similar to Hooverville’s of the ’20s), there would be color tvs in metal shanty houses.  People bought them on time ($10/month for 5 years).  It became a status symbol.Second:  Uruguayans are a very proud people.  They still talk about how their country won the World Cup of Soccer in 1950.   For a small country, it was one of their finest hours. Uruguayans love their soccer.  If you get a chance to go to a game, a game of Penarol vs anyone will be excellent.  For a few dollars, you can get a chance to see a Uruguayans in their natural habitat.   It will be a highlight of the day.Third:  It is a greatly polarized country.   Wealth dwells only with a minority of the country.  Many still struggle with daily life.   A trip to the ice cream store can easily cost $25 for 4 people for a small cone each.  It’s far out of reach for those in the bottom portion of society. What to see (in Montevideo):The Cerro (the military fortress) that overlooks the harbor.   Walk around the neighborhood and look at the murals on the building.  Dress down and wear comfortable shoes.  The streets are uneven and the neighborhood can be dangerous, but during the day it is safe.   Use common sense, and be aware of your surroundings.The Legislative Palace in Montevideo:  (their congress building)  worth a trip down the street to see.  If you plan your trip right, you can get a tour of the building.  The library is excellent.The Passiva:  A small bar near Artigus tomb (in the independence plaza).  Best hot dogs and mustard ever!    There is also one in the old city.   The one in the plaza is better.The Hotel Carrasco:  This is what luxury was in the late 1800 early 1900.   There is a small casino there if you want to lose some money.Head West out of Montevideo to Las Piedras:  a very small throwback community resembling the early 1800s.   People still live that way.  While I was there once, there was an elephant wandering the streets.  (not typical – there was a circus in town).BAKERIES:   Stop at all of them and get fresh bread and pastries.   Get 50-100gram at each of them and try them all. Outside of Montevideo:Punta Del Este:  This small city springs to life when the weather is warm.   It’s filled with tourists and worth a day trip.  Argentines & Brazilians flock to this town.  The beaches are excellent and the sand is clean and perfect.  Skip the expensive bars and go to a grocery store and get fresh bread and cheese for lunch.  One side of the city faces “Playa Brava” (wild beach) and the other “Playa Paciva” (placid beach).Colonia de Sacramento:  The city has changed little in the 300-400 years since it’s founding.   Cobblestone streets are everywhere.   Sit at a café and watch people walk by.  The area is perfect for taking photos of old towns. Things to Notice:Near downtown Montevideo is a converted shopping mall.  You can’t miss it, last time we were there, it was the only place with an escalator.  They were all mesmerized by the movie stars.  It is the location of a former prison, where the tortured citizens.There are no gumball machines in the country.   When friends came to the US, the children were fascinated by them.It’s not unusual to see a horse cart in the capital city.  Cars are expensive and gas is even more expensive.If you can get out of town towards the interior, go explore.  The tours are great places to meet people.   Most people can speak/understand a little English.  If not, smile, point and be friendly.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/26-things-you-need-to-know-about-traveling-in-central-asia/,26 Things You Need to Know About Traveling in Central Asia,Uzbekistan,"Asia – the name of this particular continent likely brings to mind the images of the Far East – lush greenery, temples and perhaps sushi. While this is certainly one picture of Asia, the continent extends far from the Pacific Ocean and encompasses a vast array of landscapes, languages and cultures.Among the less traveled, but perhaps most intriguing areas of Asia are the countries located in the center of the continent. Central Asia includes Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan.These countries offer serious travelers amazing experiences unlike any they will find in any other region on Earth for many reasons:Central Asia has only been opened to travelers recently thanks to the dismantling of the Soviet Union. While all countries of Central Asia are now independent, many retain the Soviet-style government.The huge stretches of steppe and open plains of Central Asia are considered one of the world’s last great frontiers and more tourists travel to this region to experience the truly wide open spaces every year.Kazakhstan is the world’s largest landlocked nation but has a sparse population. What it lacks in population, it more than makes up for in amazing natural appeal.Much of Central Asia is covered in steppe, cold and dry grassland, that stretches on for miles in any direction – allowing for amazing views into the distance.The most stunning natural site in the entire region is possibly Issyk Kul. This alpine lake is truly stunning and the peaceful nature of its surroundings is especially notable – especially on the least populated, South Shore.There are some areas inside Central Asia that have rarely had tourists or travelers from outside the region. Expect some curiosity and interesting accommodations as you explore deeper into this region.Due to the long history of domination by Russian Imperialism and then the Soviet Union, many of the nations in Central Asia are still struggling to build strong, independent governments. One of the most obvious symptoms of this struggle is the lack of infrastructure throughout the regions.There are a variety of languages spoken throughout Central Asia. While Russian would be useful as it is well-known throughout the countries, the native and more common languages include Turkic languages, Mongolic languages and Iranic languages as well. English is not a commonly spoken language in this region.The Ferghana Valley extends into Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and is strikingly beautiful with rivers, farmlands, and nearby mountains. This lovely, rich land is also prone to violence, however, and should be approached with caution.The mountains of Kyrgyzstan are lovely year-round and make an excellent destination for those looking to avoid the congested Ferghana Valley and experience peaceful, natural surroundings.Ancient ruins of Persian societies are easy to find in Tajikistan. Look for the remains of ancient cities nestled between far-reaching landscapes.The Silk Road, a major path for traveling over the last millennia left intriguing reminders in Uzbekistan. Look for old citadels in cities like Samarkand, Khiva, and Tashkent.The people of Uzbekistan are, perhaps, the most receptive of travelers with warm, generous personalities. While the people are friendly, the government of the country does make things a bit more complicated with paperwork.The largest, most populated city in Central Asia is Tashkent. The capital of Uzbekistan has a population of just over 3 million inhabitants and many modern trappings as well.The Aral Sea is fascinating, if depressing, to visit. This dead sea is the site of an ecological disaster and is littered with rusting boats and empty seashells.Those willing to travel into Afghanistan can see the Band-e Amir. These five lakes are stunningly blue and bright and connected by waterfalls. To reach the lakes, however, you must be willing to travel through the wilderness of the countryside.Central Asia offers skiing resorts and towns in several places. Among the most popular and accessible of these towns are Almaty and Chimbulak.• The food in Central Asia becomes more flavorful as you travel south. Expect meals to be very heavy on meat dishes and light on vegetables – it is challenging, although not impossible, to eat a vegetarian diet in this region.The drinks of choice in Central Asia include the vodka introduced to the region by the Soviets as well as the ancient choice of kumis, or fermented mare’s milk. (This is especially popular with tourists). Tea is common during mealtimes as well.Nightlife is not what you’d find in larger cities, but there are clubs and fun to be had in larger cities like Bishkek, Almaty, and Tashkent.While large-scale violence has happened in recent memory in virtually all of the Central Asian countries, most tourists are far more likely to have their things pick-pocketed than facing kidnapping, riots or bloodshed. Regardless, it is an area to approach with awareness of current events.Most Central Asian countries require a “letter of invitation” for tourists traveling to the region. These letters may be submitted on your behalf by a specialist travel agency or perhaps a hotel. Some tourists aren’t required to have a letter depending primarily on nationality.All Central Asia counties, excluding Kyrgyzstan, require a visa from travelers. Visas may be simple to get through arranged tours and specialized travel agencies or next to impossible – it all depends on the country and the mood of the government. Arrange as many visas as possible before leaving for a trip and plan time to deal with the embassies in each nation prior to leaving.The best airport to fly into the region is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Many flights also land in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, but this airport can be a bit seedy and even dangerous after dark.Trains provide a popular way into the countries of Central Asia. Trains regularly arrive in Almaty, Bishkek, and Tashkent from Moscow and cities in China. Travel by boat and car is irregular and not highly recommended.Samarkand in Uzbekistan is one of the most famous of the Silk Road cities and is a testament to the Islamic style of building and architecture with domes and stunning tile work.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/book-review-socialist-dreams-and-beauty-queens-a-couchsurfers-memoir-of-venezuela-by-jamie-maslin/,Book review: Socialist Dreams and Beauty Queens ( A Couchsurfer’s Memoir of Venezuela) by Jamie Maslin,Venezuela,"With his second book “Socialist Dreams and Beauty Queens-A Couchsurfer’s Memoir of Venezuela” Jamie Maslin creates a dual Venezuelan history and politic lesson from which you can glean points in couchsurfing technique and pitfalls. It is at times more political essay than anecdotal adventures. As such Maslin’s books work as good buffers between politicos and travelers seeking exotic locals and the ability to exercise privileged “roughing it” without privileged guilt.Maslin’s journey couch surfing across this Latin American country begins like the lyrics of You Can Call Me Al by Simon and Garfunkel. He is a non Spanish speaker and holds no Venezuelan currency and at first glance he could quite possibly use a bodyguard. Caracas is listed as the murder capital of the world and its overall crime rates don’t lend itself to seeing Venezuela as a tourist hotspot. The country’s crime statistics on the whole are staggering, something which locals will openly quote and confirm. Kidnappings are so common in Venezuela that they have three categories: conventional, express, and virtual- as well as a national 800 hotline for abductions: (800 -sequestrado)So it takes a particular mindset to have natural wonders and the promise of beauty pageant winning women outweigh the safety concerns of its unnatural man made problems. But for those like Maslin with a wanderlust or other adrenaline junkies needing a fix the opportunity to take upclose photos of Angel Falls and hike Mt. Roraima, as well as watch the Catatumbo lightning phenomena prove to be the right medicine. And don’t forget the promise of meeting internationally coveted beauty queens in training.But be forewarned you cannot travel Venezuela without becoming entangled in its politics and you cannot read Socialist Dreams and Beauty Queens without starting a discussion if not argument over said politics. In particular you will find yourself arguing the quality of life effectiveness of the policies of Hugo Chavez and his position as a world leader. Even those who Maslin contacted to couchsurf with inundated him with warnings and disclaimers to this effect. Case in point, his first few couch surfs boasted Herculean security systems and intricate household egress and entry customs. Maslin describes one host home using 6 keys across the lobby and then the elevator. And then yet another set of keys needed to be used for each floor of the apartment building he stayed in. Another homestead was surrounded by coiled razor wire which was backed up by an electronic gate and guard dogs.“Living in Venezuela is like living in Alice and Wonderland, it just doesn’t make any sense.” And as for Chavez you either deify or demonize him.So you might ask yourself “Why is Maslin doing this?” By American/British/Western standards he is on the second leg of an Axis of Evil summer camping tour. His previous venture was across Iran-documented in his first book Iranian Rappers and Persian Porn. And in his acknowledgments he mentions editing this edition while traveling yet again off the beaten path this time in Kyrgyzstan.So does this memoir act as a promo for couchsurfing in general? Is it a how to documentary of being the internet arranged house guest? No. If you are looking for this storyline to break down what couchsufing is and how best to do it-it doesn’t. Nor does it answer the question of whether couchsurfing is really for everyone and every country. Basically the narrative entails Maslin’s use of couchsurfing for economic reasons but delves more into political review and support for the Chavez government and its systems. Here Maslin is an armchair economist rather than a traditional couchsurfer as not many travelouges have full chapters dedicated to defining capital market liberalization, market-based pricing and free trade versus privatization theories.But if you are looking to investigate the natural beauty of Venezuela then keep a pen handy in reading so you can make a list of the parks and sites that Maslin explores. A lover of camping and true outdoor enthusiast he provides some excellent if not somewhat history bookish background notes- most specifically, who discovered what mountain or waterfall and how they were perceived by the Spanish monarchy during Venezuela’s colonization. He also provides a substantial biography of Hugo Chavez and the Chavista movement itself. He exposes the evils of the USA’s and OPEC’s exploitations of the country’s oil riches. And he touches on the racial dichotomy of Venezuela as it relates to class, wealth and beauty ethic. Most obviously stating that ,having African, Indian and Spanish roots, the local population is primarily brown, and like in many Latin American countries the elite are White.He points out that neighboring Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador and Peru share a common mestizo/mulatto ancestry as well as a shared history of perpetual racial liberation and revolution. The great revolution of Latin America which Che Guevara attempted to replicate from Cuba in the 1950’and 60’s stems from an uprising of the indigenous and African ancestral holding underclass. Hugo Chavez is widely known as a Cuban ally as well as Castro and Guevara doctrinaire who is emulating this position in his uniquely Venezuelan brand of socialism. This is pointed out to Maslin again and again by his hosts.One such proletariat warning issued is “ if you are White in Venezuela, you are automatically considered higher up on the ladder than a nonwhite, but many people will simply be after your money.” It is also re-enforced in the beauty queen system for which Venezuela is re-knowned. While Caracas may be known for the ugliness of murder and street crime it is also the home to the Miss Venezuela Beauty Pageant School which Maslin eagerly attempts to visit. ( Headed by Osmel Sousa- known as King of the beauty queens this Venezuelan institution has produced winners of almost sixty international titles “including five Miss Worlds, five Miss Internationals and six Miss Universes, two of which were won back to back, a feat unparallelled by any other country”)Afro-Indio Venuzeulan culture is evident in the music and indigenous dances of Venezuela that Maslin enjoys through national showcases. However black-face is still practiced in performing these cultural exhibits. From this Maslin mentions the preponderance of Black-Indian ghettos. Of note is Chavez’s use of literacy programs, music and arts education across Venezuela to improve these communities. The existence of indigenous Indian communities such as the Pemon are explored but mostly as they serve as guides and porters for visitors to the falls and mountains. Maslin has little if no contact with these cultures outside of tourist venues.Ironically, Maslin purports to be just the happy go lucky wanderer and observer in his travels but he seems to exercise a certain lack of judgment at times that can only be attributed to Western, in this case, British White privilege. Not quite the Ugly American yet he can come across as the British ass (arse?). While boasting about pub fights in the UK and showing the bravado of trusting universal brotherhood of man to protect him he allows himself to get into some foolish situations- like not carrying copies of his passport at all times ,being cheeky with armed officials, and being in possession of what is locally an obscene amount of exchanged currency. Early on in his journey he learns the reason for the barrio expression “It is better to be left with the muggers than with the Policia Metropolitana”.Although at times he does recognize his position as he puts it being a member of the “lucky sperm club”.Overall Maslin’s politics come through not like a woman’s slip showing but like a man brushing his teeth in his speedo underwear walking through your living room. The question is what were Maslin’s political views prior to visiting Venezuela? Did his visit make him pro Chavez? Did he come away having enlightened himself against western propaganda about the local reality or was he already shaking a fist at capitalism and wanting to showcase the USA , the CIA and the IMF and the Worldbank as international shadow-kings? So if you still have that pen and paper for tourist attractions you might also add to it the laundry list of documentaries and independent films addressing ”gray propaganda” and US/British manipulation of Latin America for oil and usury that he cites.Based on some of his encounters even some hardcore back packer intrepids need not consider visiting Venezuela. Jamie himself leaves with the answer to the question “ Would I return?” with a resolute “Maybe”. That said ,so where to next Mr. Maslin? I anxiously await your next publication-Is book three: How I spent My Arab Spring Vacation Backpacking Across Libya and Syria?Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/things-to-do-in-ninh-binh-vietnam/,"Things to do in Ninh Binh, Vietnam – Boat Trips, Day Hikes, Day Trips",Vietnam,"Things to do in Ninh Binh, Vietnam – Boat Trips, Day Hikes, Day Trips“Hello, Temple,” our boat guide said as she paddled us through the karst grottoes of Trang An Landscape Complex. “Who’re you calling Temple,” I thought, “and why are you just greeting me now after we’ve been literally in the same boat for an hour?”This was my introduction to the language barrier in northern Vietnam, and where I learned that in Ninh Binh, “hello,” isn’t so much a greeting, as it is everything, from “your dinner is served,” to “you’re about to step off that cliff.” In this case, I was being notified that we were approaching an ancient temple built on a rock outcropping.My husband and I visited Ninh Binh in November, taking a 2-hour ride on the Reunification Express train from Hanoi. Referred to by enterprising tour companies as “The Ha Long Bay of the Land,”Ninh Binh is a small inland town in the Red River delta, marked by limestone cliffs and rice fields. It’s the site of the ancient capital of Vietnam, established in 968 CE, after seceding from China’s Southern Han Dynasty.Our trip featured boat tours, hiking, and eating Chinese-style food. The sites visited are listed below in order of least to most physically demanding. We spent 2 days in Ninh Binh, however, 3-4 days would have been ideal.Cave at Trang An Scenic Landscape ComplexTrang An Landscape Complex (UNESCO World Heritage Site)I’m not sure what was most impressive, the towering limestone, the ancient temples, or the boat guide paddling with her feet. Visitors choose one of several boat routes from a map, some of which feature tight cave passages. Our guide navigated the caves with ease, while we cowered in the bottom of the boat to avoid hitting our heads on the rocks. The tour included several stops where we could walk around ancient temples.Trang An Scenic Landscape ComplexBy mid-morning when we finished our tour, the area was crowded with boats of tourists and the occasional wedding party. Similar boat tours in Ninh Binh include Tam Coc (said to be a brilliant lime green just before the summer rice harvests), and Van Long Nature Reserve, known for its birds and wildlife.Hoa Lu Ancient CapitalAlthough the ancient capital may be Ninh Binh’s reason for being, the complex itself was a bit underwhelming. Much of the architecture has been destroyed, leaving a few Confucian temples connected by flat walkways. The interpretive signage is mostly in Vietnamese, so our language limitations stifled our appreciation for the area. One interesting sight was the ruins of an ancient foundation and several gilded artifacts, housed in a 1970s structure of teal-painted concrete blocks. The contrast of ancient grandeur and socialist efficiency was striking.Bai Dinh Modern TempleBai Dinh PagodaI know what they say: “If you’ve seen one temple, you’ve seen them all,” but the impressive size of this complex, plus the (optional) punishing hike up Bai Dinh Mountain, was incredible. Visitors can take a tram or walk up a steep climb to the main portion of the complex.Bai Dinh MountainThe biggest temple, completed in 2010, features enormous gilded status and seemingly never-ending walls of niches. The scene evoked an eerie sense of awe in me.To counter my mental overload of beauty, I suggested that we take on the physical challenge of climbing to the ancient portion of the complex. Most tourists seem to overlook this hike, but the challenge is rewarding indeed. Breathless at the top of a mountain, we took in the expansive view, just before ducking into a small cave with an altar. Despite the tough hike to get here, we noted that someone had kept incense burning and freshly stocked offerings of fruit, beer, and snack cakes.Stair Climb at Mua CaveMua CaveIronically, this site is known more for its stone steps up a karst mountain, rather than the diminutive cave for which it is named. The complex entrance is like a carnival, featuring noisy snack bars and brightly decorated souvenir stands run by Mua Cave Ecolodge.We bought some snacks and packed them away to enjoy at the top of the climb. After climbing hundreds of stone steps, we reached the Lying Dragon Statue adorning the peak. Signage tells visitors to stop at the top of the steps, but many people climbed the rocks to access the statue. The jagged limestone makes great handholds for humans, while also serving as a bathroom for local mountain goats. Hand sanitizer is crucial.Rice Fields Viewed from the Mountain at Mua CaveOn the advice of locals, we arrived at sunset, only to have our view hampered by cloudy weather and throngs of people. Since the view from the top is 360 degrees, it seems that sunrise would be equally good, and perhaps less crowded.Entrance to Bich Dong PagodaBich Dong PagodaOur homestay host pronounced it “beek dong,” but however you say it, this pagoda offered a great hike with very few other tourists. The 3-tiered complex features Buddhist temples carved into a mountain, accessible by stone steps. A sign at the top warns visitors not to climb above the steps. We could tell from items left behind that neither goats nor humans heed this sign.FoodAlthough China relinquished control of Ninh Binh in the 10th century, its influence on local cuisine remains. We tried a few mediocre Vietnamese dishes before finding better luck with Chinese stir-fries. My favorite dish was “burnt rice,” a crispy cake of rice served with a warm and goopy, cornstarch-thickened soy sauce. Although this sauce may have been unappetizing on its own, it complemented the rice perfectly and tasted great after a long day of hiking.Other TipsAs Ninh Binh’s tourism industry grows, the construction of new hotels and restaurants abounds. Watch out for areas that may be next to a noisy construction site. Check online hotel reviews or Google Earth photos to investigate. We had a great experience at Tam Coc Westlake Homestay, where we got a quiet room and made-to-order breakfast for the cost of just breakfast in the USA.While cash is the only form of payment accepted in most of Ninh Binh, ATMs are rare. Bring all the cash you’ll need.The tourism season is year-round, however, summer offers brilliant green rice fields, with the tradeoffs of heat and rain. We chose to visit in November when it is a bit cooler and typically sunny. Unfortunately, we were met with unseasonably misty weather, but perhaps the mist enhanced the mountain landscapes.Share this: "

These small bowls of soup noodles served with a sprinkle of the key ingredient (pig’s blood) has a rich history and cultural aspect attached to it. This dish was originally served from the boats of the huge canal network that Bangkok used to have, and thus the name. While having pig’s blood in their bowl of noodles may discourage some people, the blood gets cooked almost immediately. It comes in touch with the hot broth and gives the dish a unique creamy texture which you’ll only find in Bankok cuisine.While there are vendors selling boat noodles at almost every street corner of Bangkok, ‘Doy Kuay Teow Reua’ near Victory Monument is one of the best places which continues to serve this dish in its original form.2: Green Papaya Salad (Som Tam) – ThailandGreen Papaya Salad is an extremely flavorful and spicy salad made primarily with green papaya, Thai bird’s eye chili and shrimp paste. The dish originates from the North-eastern or Isan region of Thailand. However, you can find varieties of this dish all over Thailand. If you want to taste this dish in Bangkok, you can head over to a place called Som Tam Jay So, which serves a replica of the various versions of Som Tam you will find in the Isan region.3: Stir-Fried Pork with Holy Basil (Pad Kra Pao ) – ThailandThis is a staple food of many office goers and local people of Thailand, and in Bangkok, you will find some of the best versions of this dish. The street food vendors of Bangkok have taken this everyday dish to a mouth-watering level, and while visiting Bangkok, you cannot waste an opportunity of tasting this delicious stir-fried dish. It is served with a side of fried egg and steamed rice. Just mix the rice with a bit of meat and egg, and you’ll be in taste heaven.4. Sticky Rice (xôi) – VietnamThe Vietnamese know how to prepare rice in various ways. In the streets, you would find the sticky rice that could have a sweet or salty taste. There is the sticky corn rice (xôi bắp), common in northern Vietnam that is comprised of softly cooked corn mixed with rice then topped with green mung bean and tasty fried shallots. This style of preparation makes it sugary. The salty one (xôi mặn) is comprised of rice, dried shrimp, green onion, and Chinese sausage stirred with oil and flavored with soy sauce.Explore rice in Vietnam and find out what it tastes like when various ingredients are is mixed with it. You will be surprised.5. Roll Cake (Bánh Cuốn) – VietnamJust like a sandwich in the west, Vietnamese like to get creative with whatever they put in rolls of food. This is evident in their popular roll cakes known as (Bánh cuốn). The rolls are made of thin slices of baked dough. There are two different styles of roll cake that you would come across in the streets. There are those filled primarily with pork meat known as (bánh cuốn nhân thịt) and those filled with steamed rice served with spicy fish sauce, bean sprouts and herbs known as “bánh ướt” (wet cake). They are normally sold on moving carts. If you spot one, hurry up and catch it before it gets away!6: Green Tea Salad (Laphet Thohk) – MyanmarAt the street side tea stalls of Myanmar, you’ll often find various salads that you can have with your tea. Among those, the unique and popular salad is the Laphet Thohk. It is a salad made with pickled tea leaves, peanuts, tomatoes, green chilies, lime juice, and different sauces. The end result is a very unique, tangy, spicy, saucy mixture, which you must try while you are in Myanmar.7: Chinese Style Barbeque – Yangon, MyanmarThe Chinese colonies of Myanmar play a huge part in its culture and history. So your journey to Yangon will be incomplete if you don’t pay a visit to the Chinatown of Yangon. The 19th street of Chinatown, which is popularly known as the Barbecue Street, is famous for its street food vendors selling Chinese-style barbecued goodies. Just grab a table, order whatever looks nice, have a beer and indulge in the action-packed environment.8: Pork/Chicken Adobo – PhilippinesThis may be the most popular dish of the Philippines, and you really need to try it while you’re there. Tender pieces of meat marinated in vinegar and soy sauce, this dish is easily available on the street side, and it is a great experience to have this famous dish in its homeland.9: Banana-Q – PhilippinesAll you sweet lovers must not miss the opportunity to taste this extremely popular evening snack of the locals of the Philippines. The dish is made with a local variety of banana called ‘Saba,’ which is coated in brown sugar, deep-fried and then skewered on a stick like a piece of barbecued meat. You can find this dish everywhere throughout the Philippines, especially during the evening time.10: Balut – PhilippinesThis might not be the most appetizing street food you can have while you’re in the Philippines, but it is almost certainly the most unique one. Balut is a developing duck embryo, still in its shell, boiled and eaten in one gulp. It is considered an aphrodisiac by the locals, and though not for the faint-hearted, still it is one of the most unique street food experiences you can have in the Philippines.That’s my list of awesome street foods to look for as you go about your adventure in Southeast Asia.

https://amateurtraveler.com/vietnam-visions/,Vietnam Visions,Vietnam,"I’ve spent more time in Vietnam than any other country besides my home; in fact I lived there for the last year. Originally as part of my career break in 2007, I traveled through Vietnam from North to South soaking up it’s fascinating culture for 4 weeks.I had already traveled my way through Thailand and expected Vietnam would be similar; to my surprise I was wrong. From the moment I landed in Hanoi I knew it was different than the rest of SE Asia. There was no McDonalds, very little trace of western influence, and the people really did wear those conical hats (and they weren’t just wearing them to impress the tourists); Vietnam was really intact.The whole country is diverse and it’s best if you can spend time to visit it completely observing the difference in people, terrain, culture, and food. The North is home to the old city of Hanoi, the rice terraces of Sapa, and the coastal site of Ha Long Bay. I found the north to be richer in ethnic diversity with influence coming from the neighboring countries of China and Laos. Local markets burst in color, and odors; not to mention many foods most westerners would never consider eating!I traveled by train through the center of Vietnam becoming acquainted with the historic little towns of Hoi An and Hue. This is where you find the warring history of Vietnam. Very few towns remained in tact due to the constant fighting. The central coast was a hot bed of activity and many old ruins tell the old stories of empires and modern wars.The south is home to some surprises; did you know there are sand dunes in Vietnam? Neither did I! The beautiful beach towns of Nha Trang and Mui Ne boast sun and adventure providing a great break from city life. As you continue inland you come to Da Lat, the heartland of Vietnam. The rolling hills of the central highlands are lined with rows and rows of vegetables providing all of the produce and flowers for the southern part of the country. It also provides a super relief from the humid, balmy weather at lower elevations!Ho Chi Min City (HCMC) is the only real bustling pseudo modern city; and it’s quickly developing. Construction cranes dot the landscape while the river snakes in and out of the many districts. HCMC is the ‘pot of gold’ at the end of the rainbow for locals looking to move out of their villages and make a better living for themselves and their families. Finally, move on to the Mekong Delta where life is in a constant state of flux thanks to the lack of solid ground to live upon.As I traveled and lived in Vietnam, I continued to meet eager locals who wanted to share their culture and experiences with me. I found myself on the back of motorbikes, riding bicycles, navigating local fish markets, taking cyclos, cooking Pho, and even navigating the streets of HCMC on my own motorbike.The country is changing quickly, so make sure you make a stop there before McDonald’s does!To read more of Sherry’s more obscure cultural observations about Vietnam visit:Goodbye Vietnam!

https://amateurtraveler.com/africa-overland/,"Africa Overland – Tour from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe",Zambia,"Once a year I try and take a trip with a group of listeners of Amateur Traveler somewhere in the world. This year we chose southern Africa and took an overland trip to South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe. We drove from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. This was a camping trip and an overland safari. Before the trip, my wife said, “this will probably be my only safari”. After the trip, she started saying things like, “when we go next time…” Let’s see if I can get you interested as well.you can also listen to Africa Overland – Johannesburg to Victoria Falls – Episode 670Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Intrepid TravelJohannesburg, South AfricaBlyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaThe Three RondavelsBourke’s Luck PotholesGod’s WindowKruger National Park, South AfricaMorning Game DriveEvening Game DriveThabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaVillage VisitMoremi Gorge, BotswanaMakgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaVictoria Falls, ZimbabweLivingstone, ZambiaWhat to PackConclusionIntrepid TravelWe had traveled previously to China, Morocco, Cambodia, and India with Intrepid Travel so we booked this trip with Intrepid as well. We have had good experiences with Intrepid with great guides every time. Our guide to Cambodia was even named the guide of the year a few years later. Intrepid has a number of overland trips in southern Africa and we chose their Kruger to Victoria Falls – 8 days/7 nights trip.Normally for these overland trips, they host groups of up to 24 in a custom made bus, but we ended up with a smaller group in a small van with a guide (Philip) and a driver (Goodman).Johannesburg, South AfricaAll the rest of our group got into Johannesburg a day early and explored the city but Joan and I spent 3 days in Capetown instead.We flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg in the early afternoon but did not do any exploring. Joan wasn’t feeling great, possibly from starting the malaria medicine that day. Our meeting hotel was the Holiday Inn Rosebank. I had stayed in Rosebank 6 months previous on the way to a Botswana safari so I knew how easy it is to get from the airport to Rosebank via the train. We hopped on the train right at the airport terminal and made one connection to get to Rosebank. The Holiday Inn is within view of the station at the Rosebank Mall. We chilled out in the room until our 6 pm meetup.We met our group and our guide Philip and driver Goodman in the hotel. The other members of our group were Pat and Lis, who had been on the Amateur Traveler India trip, and Lis’ two sons Alex and Eric. We had an early start in the morning so after our meeting, Pat and Joan and I headed into the mall for dinner and then an early bed.Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaWe met up at 4:45 for a 5 am departure so that we could get out of town before the traffic got bad. The hotel had made up breakfast bags for us with some pastries and fruit, juice and a yogurt bar. When we stopped for coffee and bathroom at a truck stop at 7:30 – the Alzu Petroport on the N4. We saw ostriches and rhinos outside as there was a small private preserve. I made sure everyone got a look as it was unlikely we would see rhinos in the wild these days.At 9:45 we stopped for groceries and food for our lunches at a SuperSpar market. Eric and Alex got a takeaway tray of meat with a side of meat from the local Wimpy Burger.Our goal the first day was to get to Kruger National Park before they closed the gate when the sunset, but on the way to Kruger we drove through the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve. Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve is not what I picture when I picture Africa. On the way to the canyon, we passed small towns with modern coffee shops and B&Bs. We past signs that that were advertising the local fishing.The Three RondavelsOur first stop was at a vista point where we could view the Three Rondavels. These rock structures remind locals of the local roundhouses or rondavels.Bourke’s Luck PotholesWe picnicked for lunch at Bourke’s Luck Potholes. Here there are some small waterfalls and the river has carved a series of kettle shaped potholes into the rock. The area is named after a prospector who predicted gold in the area… but did not find it. So presumably Bourke’s Luck was bad.God’s WindowWe drove through forests of pine trees as we drove around the canyon. Logging is a major part of the local economy. We stopped again at God’s Window to get one last view of the area before heading downhill into Kruger National Park.Kruger National Park, South AfricaAs the sun was getting low to set we entered Kruger National Park, which has 150 mammal species, 110 reptiles species, and over 500 bird species. We hoped to see the Big 5: rhino, elephant, lion, Cape Buffalo, and leopard. There are also the “Ugly 5”: wildebeest, warthog, hyena, the maribou stork, and the leopard faced buzzard.If you don’t get to the rest camp before the gates shut at sundown you will be fined. During the night and early morning hours, only the official park vehicles are allowed on the road. So we were anxious to get to the rest camp but also slowed down as we started to see animals along the side of the road.We headed to Satara Rest Camp and set up our tents as it was getting dark, with plenty of help and advice from Philip and Goodman. Philip made spaghetti Bolognese and salad for dinner, and we made it an early night. We were pleased to see that along with the sleeping bags we each got a cot, mattress, pillow, and blanket. The tents were large enough to stand up and to hold two cots and at least some of our luggage.The facilities were nicer than expected, bathroom blocks with toilet stalls and showers with wooden doors. In general, I have never seen such nice facilities at U.S. national and state parks as we did at all of our stops in Africa. Someone was always in the facilities cleaning something it seemed.Morning Game DriveWe had booked an early morning game drive so we had another early start. We were up at 4 to be picked up at 5. Philip had hot water ready for coffee and tea and rusks to dip. Rusks are like thick biscotti but made from cereal like muesli, really good. (Ouma brand recommended). Philip walked us to reception at 4:45.It was so cold that the guide gave us each a blanket. He gave 2 people on each side spotlights to shine out to spot animals. From 5 to 6 it was dark and we had no sightings. From 6-8 we saw kudu, mongoose, steenbok, and then in the last 10 minutes, we saw two lions sitting near the side of the road. Fabulous! One of the reasons you do early morning or late night drives is that you are more likely to see the carnivores like the big cats at that time. I kept track of where we had gone one our morning game drive with the maps.com iPhone app so I was able to show Goodman and Philip where we had been when we spotted the lions so we drove by that spot but did not find the lions again. We did find a large herd of cape buffalo we had seen previously and a herd of elephants complete with at least 3 very young elephants that were fascinating to watch.Back at the camp, Philip made eggs, bacon, bread, along with leftover pasta sauce. We broke camp and left for Letaba Rest Camp at around 10, watching for game along the way.We stopped at Oliphants overlook, where you look over a watering hole with elephants and hippos. We bought Kruger guide books with pictures of animals in the back that you can check off as you see them.Each of the rest camps has two maps up with magnets on them that mark where people have seen some of the animals. While rhinos are on the map, they do not mark them because this was something that poachers were using to find and kill the animals for their horns. A rhino horn will sell for $100,000 in China. Rhinos are likely to become extinct in my lifetime at the current rate of poaching.We got to camp at 3:30 and set up camp. Philip put out a fruit salad. We took a walk to the river but couldn’t see much there, sat at the restaurant and got drinks, then went to the Elephant Museum, which was really interesting. Philip made lamb chops and sausage, pap (made from maize), and corn for dinner.Evening Game DriveWe headed to reception at 7:45 for our night drive. This time Joan had one of the spotlights. In the first hour, we saw a leopard, hyena pups, and a jackal. The second hour was quieter, though we did see spring hare and scrub hare. The guide was informative and allowed time for photos.Back to camp at 10 and to bed.Departure time was at 7:15. Breakfast at 6:45 was cereal, bread, coffee.Thabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaWe headed west to Thabaphaswa (meaning ‘black and white mountain’ in the local dialect) for a farm stay. We passed by Zion Christian Church, which Goodman told us had 2.5 million people on Easter. The bishop lives in a sort of tower, and he apparently blesses and heals people. The complex was massive.We stopped at a mall for lunch. The mall could easily have been somewhere in the U.S. as it had the same design and some of the same stores.We got to the farm, which had a private reserve next door, and saw nyala, ostriches and their eggs, and monkeys. We were greeted in the driveway by our host and directed to go to the area we’d be staying. It was down a very long rocky dirt road, and when we arrived Philip assigned our rooms, which were buildings at various levels on a rocky hill, connected by cement paths and steps.Each building consisted of 2 or 4 rooms, which each had one full wall made of panes of glass with a door that matched. Each building was painted in a different color. Most had bunk beds or just two twin mattresses on the floor. We brought our sleeping bags and pillows and blankets, and just what we needed for the night, and made up our beds. We had about an hour and a half break before dinner.At 5 we drove to the main house where we sat in chairs in a circle on a patio, with our host as he described the work he has done to bring development and training young people to farm. There were 2 really nice good-sized dogs that greeted us, and another smaller one. We learned the 2 are “boerbulls”.We walked to the cattle pen. The dogs came with us but were very intimidated by the cows. Back at the house, there was now a fire in the center of the circle where we’d sat, and the host talked about the cattle. He breeds for studs and hires out their services, and he offers a cattle hotel so a new farmer can place their cow with him, breed for better offspring, and build up his farm.When Europeans came in they preferred the cattle breeds that they knew but those cattle were less suited for Africa so what they are trying to do is re-introduce the Nguni cattle that the local Bantu peoples raised. These animals are much more resistant to African diseases and the long-horned cattle can protect themselves from predators like leopards. Many a leopard had been killed by farmers trying to protect their prissy European cattle.Dinner was a traditional “braai” or BBQ, starting with a Mopani worm (cooked, crispy), sorghum beer, sausage, lamb and steak, chicken feet, spinach, Coleslaw, pap, and Chakalaka, with pudding for dessert. We could also get wine or beer for a fee.At 9:10 we said goodnight and went back to the rooms. The shower and toilet were outside within a bamboo enclosure, and hot water is provided by a “donkey boiler” which Philip kept heated by building a fire under it. We didn’t know if we’d have hot water in the morning. It was a little colder overnight in the rooms, they are probably not as airtight as the tents.We heard lions in the neighboring game reserve roaring by at least 5 am and got up at 5:30 for our 6:15 breakfast. We were pleased to have hot water for showers, but we still made them very quick as we were outside and the air was very cold. We packed up and met at the van where Philip and Goodman had cereal and tea and coffee ready.Village VisitOur host drove over and we followed his truck. At one point we stopped and he came and explained that we were in the “Platinum belt” and told us about underground and above-ground mining. One of his workers got in our van to go to the village with us to translate.At about 8:30 we arrived at the village for our visit. The buildings are similar to what I see when I do volunteer work in Tijuana, made of cinder block and no indoor toilets. A man from the village was somehow designated to be our guide, and Goodman actually did some translating, and a young man from the village also came over and did the bulk of the initial translation.The man we were visiting with owned a store, so we saw how it is set up, very neat, snacks, dry goods, and also meat. His bedroom is in the same building, and that is the entire building. He also grows vegetables to sell. He showed us his peanut plants and we tried raw peanuts, which tasted like beans. The young man we met had just finished school for mechanical engineering and was looking for an internship, which he said is the typical career starting point. We learned that typically a small percentage of the people in the village works in the mines, and the rest of the people work in support services. They do make their own houses, there is a community cement mixer to make the blocks.One of the things that I like about Intrepid tours is that they usually involve some sort of community connection. It might be visiting a rehabilitation center as we did in Morocco or a village as we did in Cambodia or South Africa.We left the village at around 9:15 and made a stop around 10:10-10:30 to pick up drinks. We drove into Botswana and got to our campsite at Moremi Gorge at around 1:45. We set up camp while Philip made tuna salad and fruit salad for lunch.Moremi Gorge, BotswanaWe started a hike of the Moremi Gorge around 3:30 with an intro and information about a large baobab tree. Philip had already shown us the inside of the fruit, which is hard and which is where we get cream of tartar.We selected walking sticks to use on the hike and got started. The hike crosses a stream river several times, so the sticks were to help keep our balance while walking on rocks. We saw a dassie, and our guide identified several plants including a broom cluster fig and a rock scrambling fig. We saw a plant with a hole dug under it, and the guide said that if a porcupine eats the roots of a plant, it is safe for humans to eat that plant.To complete the hike, we had to climb on boulders that had cables or sections of garden hose attached, definitely more strenuous than we had expected. But we all managed it both up and down. Just before we got to the last waterfall the cables went away and we had to climb around a set of boulders an uncomfortable height off the ground.The waterfalls were very pretty. The hike back was much faster, which was good as it would be getting dark soon. Somehow stepping over the rocks in the stream and all the other aspects of the hike seemed much easier after the bouldering portion. Philip drove us back to camp and made Philip’s Surprise, basically chicken burritos. He had also provided ingredients for a variation on s’mores, with Nutella and Marie’s biscuits in place of chocolate and Graham crackers. They were actually very good!Alex and Eric had bought some cane alcohol, and the campsite actually had a tall counter with a sink which made the perfect bar. Pat had bought wine, and we shared our Port from Stellenbosch.While the rest of us had hiked the gorge, Alex had stayed at the camp, and when we got back he showed us photos of the zebra that had been wandering through the campsite while we were gone. The zebra actually hung around and was just in the trees later in the evening as well.Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaWe were up showering at 5:30. We broke camp, had breakfast at 6:45 and were on our way by about 7:30 to drive to Nata. We had a quick bathroom/fuel stop, and a shopping stop from 10:30-11:15, in a really nice SuperSpar market.We got to the Nata rest camp and set up camp. We had a drive scheduled out onto the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. On the drive, we saw jackals, helicopter birds, ostriches, wildebeests, kori bustards, and zebra.At the salt pan, we saw a huge number of flamingoes in the sunset. In fine African tradition, the numerous vehicles from the rest camp brought coolers of beer and other drinks for a traditional “sundowner”.Philip made poiki for dinner, a traditional stew with kudu meat, made in a dutch oven over the fire.After dinner, Philip took us for a quick walk into the dark around our campsite to find bush babies. Bushbabies are one of the smallest and cutest primates. We only had to look in a few trees before we saw their large eyes staring down at us.Victoria Falls, ZimbabweWe packed up camp and headed out around 7:15 am to head to Victoria Falls. We got to Victoria Falls Rest Camp around 1:30, and Philip and Goodman said they would set up camp for us. (Yay!) We had lunch at the restaurant at the camp, “in Da Belly”. You have to love a restaurant with croc, warthog, and impala on the menu.The camp was right in town, unlike our other camps so far.Philip drove us to the Falls, where we had a guided tour of the viewing point. We were glad that Philip had advised us to wear rain gear and sandals as we definitely got wet. There are more than a dozen different viewing spots and the half to the right get more and more wet. At one it was basically like being in a driving rain.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-928fc4R/0/f68e5013/1280/IMG_6852-1280.mp4The Falls are spectacular, with a rainbow visible for much of the walk, at times a double rainbow. The tour lasted about 2 hours, though you could do it in less.Philip had made reservations at Pariah State, a restaurant close to the camp, at 7. The restaurant was really good. We split a spinach and feta pizza and a chocolate dessert. Joan tried Zambezi beer, Chris had a cider. The entire bill for the 2 of us was $22.We were able to have a later start on the last day, with breakfast around 8. Philip and Goodman kindly took down our tents, before they packed up to drive the van back to Johannesburg. You can normally book this trip either one way as we did or round trip which takes 14+ days and visits some other great sites on the way back to Johannesburg like the Okavango Delta and the Khama Rhino Sanctuary.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-ZRjQWKx/0/3f0480f4/4K/IMG_2191-4K.jpgWe said our goodbyes and put our luggage in storage, and then went with Lis and Alex and Eric to the market in town to look at handicrafts. It was quite an experience, with many vendors all with very similar wooden and stone artwork and lots of haggling and even bartering. Lis gave one of the vendors things from her purse like a tape measure and nail clippers.One of the reasons that people were trying to barter with us for our shirts, shoes, and nicknacks is that Zimbabwe’s economy is quite screwed up after they had runaway hyperinflation. Over 90% of the country are out of work and it is a wonder that the country still functions. But the people we met were friendly, the crafts were great and I was glad we could buy some to take home.Livingstone, ZambiaJoan and I wanted to visit Zambia which is just over the bridge from Victoria Falls. We said our goodbyes, went back to the camp and got a cab for $5 to the border. There we exited Zimbabwe and walked between the two borders, which included crossing the bridge, with additional walking before and after the bridge. It was farther than we expected. At the Zambia side, we got in a line to enter and were behind a group that we thought were also tourists. It was moving slowly if at all, and after about 5 min someone in a uniform came over and told us there were 2 lines and we should be in the other line, which was for tourists. That was much shorter and it went quickly from there.We then got a cab into Livingstone, the town across the border. We shared it with someone and it was about $10 each. On the way, we talked to both the driver and our fellow passenger about Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zambia is doing much better than Zimbabwe due to its better government for the last few decades.The driver and other passenger gave us recommendations for what to do in Livingstone, but since we didn’t have much time, and the crossing had taken longer than we expected, we just got lunch and didn’t try to see more of town.We got a cab back to the border for $10, as listed on a price list the driver showed us, then got a taxi that goes from border to border to avoid the long walk, and then a third cab to the Vic Falls Rest Camp. We had time to sit at the restaurant and have a soda and iced tea before getting our luggage out and waiting for our driver from the Old Drift Lodge to pick us up for our next adventure.What to PackSouth Africa, Botswana Travel Adapter Plug – the right adapter for Southern AfricaOutlet Travel Power Strip Surge Protector with 4 Smart USB Charging Ports – a small surge protector to plug in more things1004 Luci Lux Warm Frosted Decor Light – a collapsable solar lantern for your tentheadlamp – a good headlamp will let you be hands-free in your tentAlso, see What to Pack for a Mobile African Safari for a more detail list.ConclusionIt was interesting seeing Africa, or this corner of Africa at least from ground level on an overland tour. The countries are of a good size so there is a lot of driving on this trip, but there was something interesting to do every day. I would love to go back and do one of the other tours that Intrepid has in southern Africa. I would try and see if we could get Goodman and Philip again if I could!One other surprise is that the trip sounded like our wildlife experiences would mainly be in Kruger National Park. We certainly had great wildlife encounters there, but we also would just see elephants or giraffes or zebra crossing the road some times. The stretch of road from Botswana to Zimbabwe is called the Elephant Highway. Much of it is inside the national parkland.As with all road trips, the most important thing is great traveling companions and, like every other Amateur Traveler trip, we were richly blessed in that regard.See all my Africa photosShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/zambia-road-trip/,Zambia Road Trip from Bottom to Top,Zambia,"Self-driving through Zambia is an experience unto itself, and certainly not a journey for the faint of heart. This is a rugged landscape where the condition of the roads can be downright shocking. GPS often fails, the roads (including the highways) are tricky minefields of potholes, and poor signage results in journeys that take twice as long as anticipated.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}LivingstoneVictoria FallsLake KaribaA word on potholesLusakaKabweMeeting the localsMpikaKapishya Hot Springs LodgeWildlife and national parksBorder crossing to TanzaniaBut, all of those challenges are part of the fun and contribute to a beautiful, endearing, immersive African experience. Seeing Zambia by car is absolutely the best way to get to know this country and its people. Landscapes of dry scrubland, majestic acacias, and thatch hut villages accompany you every mile of the journey. And as the sun sets in brilliant crimson, locals ride bicycles to their homes, haul bales of sticks on their heads, and children wave as you drive past.This journey took four days as part of a larger southern Africa self-driving road trip, driving in a roughly north-eastern direction. The northern part of this route is The Great North Road and is the main arterial highway used by anyone traveling through Zambia. The route began at Livingstone and ended at the Tunduma-Nakonde border crossing into Tanzania.LivingstoneWith an evocative colonial name that reminds one of the eponymous British explorer, the relaxed town of Livingstone in the south-west of Zambia is likely to be the most touristed place in Zambia. It is also the closest town to the border crossing into Botswana. As the main hub to Victoria Falls, Zambezi River activities and Mosi-Oa-Tunya National Park, Livingstone has good infrastructure and services.There are lots of high-end accommodation options around, as well as campgrounds with good facilities. Take this opportunity to splurge on decent food and gin and tonics at sunset, especially at the wonderful riverside bars and restaurants such as the Victoria Falls Waterfront Restaurant.Victoria FallsLocals call it Mosi-Oa-Tunya, the smoke that thunders. By far Zambia’s biggest draw, the local translation for Zambia’s iconic waterfall is certainly well earned. Nature is on display at its most spectacular and furious here, an inconceivable curtain of water 1,700 meters (5,600 feet) wide, and over 100 meters (330 feet) high. The effect of this colossal power generates mists that rise high into the air.The site is huge, and there are different walking paths available, with green hobbit-esque cloak raincoats for those hoping to keep dry from the spray. The most intense viewpoint is the precarious Knife’s Edge Bridge that passes immediately in front of the falls, and visitors are guaranteed to get soaked. Another walk leads to the very top of the falls, where the calm Zambezi River drops off the end of the world.If you’re feeling brave and depending on the season, swim in the notorious Devil’s Pool, a naturally formed pool that comes right up to the lip of the falls. Climbing down the steep forest trail to the river far below, you can see the bungee jumpers leaping from the bridge above. For thrillseekers, don’t forget your passport when you bungee, because the bridge is actually the border between, Zambia and Zimbabwe!Lake KaribaRunning along part of Zambia’s southern border is Lake Kariba, a man-made lake created when the Kariba dam was created, and Kariba gorge flooded in turn. Besides lovely photographs, the lake on the Zambian side doesn’t offer much in activities, and most tourist infrastructure is found near the dam in the north.A visit here is only for the intrepid, or in our case, those who took a wrong turn and got lost. Accommodation is extremely basic, so expect no food or electricity, and access by road is a very hard drive (high-clearance 4×4 is essential) to reach small lakeside villages such as Sinazongwe.A word on potholesBe prepared for Zambia’s biggest challenge – bad roads. Smaller asphalt roads are often peppered with deep, sharp-edged craters that make the road look like the surface of the moon. Sometimes, the potholes have been filled in with a pile of knobbly rocks, creating teeth-rattling speedbumps. The resulting slalom demands low speed and your full attention.Things get even more hair-raising on the highways when drivers are most unaware. Long, smooth stretches of tarmac are interrupted suddenly with pothole trenches that span the entire width of the road. They’re so deep that they can rip the wheels off a semitrailer, evidenced by the many overturned trucks along the roadside, the stranded drivers sleeping on top. To detect them, offroad tracks on either side of the road is the telltale sign.LusakaWelcome to Zambia’s capital, a cacophony of office blocks and traffic-choked, dust-blown arterial roads. This is not a pretty city, nor is there much incentive to stay very long. It’s madness here, and we even saw a tout with a puppy in each hand, trying to sell them to cars at red traffic lights.For those interested in stopping, it’s worth checking out the lively Lusaka City Market, bustling with clothes and African souvenirs. But my recommendation is to drive straight through Lusaka and continue to Kabwe.KabweA sanctuary in the most unlikely of forms, Kabwe came as a sigh of relief from a long day on the highway. A shoddy asphalt road led down a single main street.Though not much to look at, Kabwe had a supermarket and some decent accommodation options, such as the brilliant Tuskers hotel, which features a pool and a spacious dining room, where the white-aproned servers observed every courtesy in table service.For cheaper accommodation, a number of local motels and guesthouses offer comfortable rooms. The lush gardens from our guesthouse had a number of strange garden artworks on display, such as a fiberglass swan with a broken neck, and three taxidermied impalas, frozen in terrifying forms.Meeting the localsZambia is full of friendly people, and it doesn’t take much to engage in conversation with them. At petrol station stops, women selling great bunches of bananas on baskets on their heads liked to come in for a chat. Smaller villages sometimes have a local shop to buy snacks or drinks. Within minutes, you’ll likely find yourself kicking around a soccer ball made of newspaper and string with a group of excitable children.Along the highway, local potters and craftsmen display long lines of their pots and ceramics to entice travelers to stop and buy something. It’s worth stopping for a look, as many Zambians like to practice their English and tell you about themselves, their families and their trade.MpikaA town on the highway in the north of the country, Mpika was little more than a refueling stop. Whilst buying groceries in a local supermarket, we attracted a ‘car guard’, an enterprising young kid who agreed to watch our parked car in exchange for money.When we returned, he wasn’t guarding our car at all, but negotiating with another car to guard them. Upon spotting us returning, he sprinted over to show us what a good job he had done. Impressed with his hustle, we gave him a few Kwacha for his effort.Kapishya Hot Springs LodgeNestled deep in the forests of Zambia is the Kapishya Lodge, built around the hot springs of the same name. The thermal pool is a sulfur-free pool, with soft, bubbling sand rising from the geothermal activity underfoot.The lodges are lofty, timber constructions that overlook the Mansha river, great for rafting trips during the day. In the evening, guests all get together in the long dining room for a nice communal meal.Wildlife and national parksZambia is a wonderful country for spotting wildlife, and the occasional zebra might skip in front of your car on some of the smaller roads. But for great game spotting, there are several national parks of note. We visited national parks in neighboring Botswana and Tanzania, so we didn’t visit any whilst in Zambia.However, these are some recommendations from people we met and guesthouses we stayed at. Kafue, Lower Zambezi, South Luangwa National Parks are all ideal spots for wildlife and bird-watching and easily accessible by road for anyone doing a self-drive trip.Border crossing to TanzaniaTunduma is where border control into Tanzania takes place. When we first drove up, it appeared to be a nightmare in disorganization, with an extremely long line of stationary trucks waiting to be inspected. A car park full of cars near the border had a coating of dust so thick, that we wondered if the cars had been there for years.There are some things to remember when crossing here. A few government buildings handle all of the official business, whilst outside, a hectic conglomeration of people mill about. The rule of thumb is to ignore anybody who offers to help you if they’re not behind a desk. Anybody else is looking for money to ‘help’ you cross the border, or will simply steal your paperwork.This route was a relatively short sojourn in Zambia. But with minds focused on the challenges of driving, wonderful people to meet along the way, and the most impressive waterfall in Africa, the experience was unlike any other; an intoxicating, beautiful and memorable adventure.Share this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/africa-overland/,"Africa Overland – Tour from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe",Zimbabwe,"Once a year I try and take a trip with a group of listeners of Amateur Traveler somewhere in the world. This year we chose southern Africa and took an overland trip to South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe. We drove from Johannesburg, South Africa to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. This was a camping trip and an overland safari. Before the trip, my wife said, “this will probably be my only safari”. After the trip, she started saying things like, “when we go next time…” Let’s see if I can get you interested as well.you can also listen to Africa Overland – Johannesburg to Victoria Falls – Episode 670Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Intrepid TravelJohannesburg, South AfricaBlyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaThe Three RondavelsBourke’s Luck PotholesGod’s WindowKruger National Park, South AfricaMorning Game DriveEvening Game DriveThabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaVillage VisitMoremi Gorge, BotswanaMakgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaVictoria Falls, ZimbabweLivingstone, ZambiaWhat to PackConclusionIntrepid TravelWe had traveled previously to China, Morocco, Cambodia, and India with Intrepid Travel so we booked this trip with Intrepid as well. We have had good experiences with Intrepid with great guides every time. Our guide to Cambodia was even named the guide of the year a few years later. Intrepid has a number of overland trips in southern Africa and we chose their Kruger to Victoria Falls – 8 days/7 nights trip.Normally for these overland trips, they host groups of up to 24 in a custom made bus, but we ended up with a smaller group in a small van with a guide (Philip) and a driver (Goodman).Johannesburg, South AfricaAll the rest of our group got into Johannesburg a day early and explored the city but Joan and I spent 3 days in Capetown instead.We flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg in the early afternoon but did not do any exploring. Joan wasn’t feeling great, possibly from starting the malaria medicine that day. Our meeting hotel was the Holiday Inn Rosebank. I had stayed in Rosebank 6 months previous on the way to a Botswana safari so I knew how easy it is to get from the airport to Rosebank via the train. We hopped on the train right at the airport terminal and made one connection to get to Rosebank. The Holiday Inn is within view of the station at the Rosebank Mall. We chilled out in the room until our 6 pm meetup.We met our group and our guide Philip and driver Goodman in the hotel. The other members of our group were Pat and Lis, who had been on the Amateur Traveler India trip, and Lis’ two sons Alex and Eric. We had an early start in the morning so after our meeting, Pat and Joan and I headed into the mall for dinner and then an early bed.Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve, South AfricaWe met up at 4:45 for a 5 am departure so that we could get out of town before the traffic got bad. The hotel had made up breakfast bags for us with some pastries and fruit, juice and a yogurt bar. When we stopped for coffee and bathroom at a truck stop at 7:30 – the Alzu Petroport on the N4. We saw ostriches and rhinos outside as there was a small private preserve. I made sure everyone got a look as it was unlikely we would see rhinos in the wild these days.At 9:45 we stopped for groceries and food for our lunches at a SuperSpar market. Eric and Alex got a takeaway tray of meat with a side of meat from the local Wimpy Burger.Our goal the first day was to get to Kruger National Park before they closed the gate when the sunset, but on the way to Kruger we drove through the Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve. Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve is not what I picture when I picture Africa. On the way to the canyon, we passed small towns with modern coffee shops and B&Bs. We past signs that that were advertising the local fishing.The Three RondavelsOur first stop was at a vista point where we could view the Three Rondavels. These rock structures remind locals of the local roundhouses or rondavels.Bourke’s Luck PotholesWe picnicked for lunch at Bourke’s Luck Potholes. Here there are some small waterfalls and the river has carved a series of kettle shaped potholes into the rock. The area is named after a prospector who predicted gold in the area… but did not find it. So presumably Bourke’s Luck was bad.God’s WindowWe drove through forests of pine trees as we drove around the canyon. Logging is a major part of the local economy. We stopped again at God’s Window to get one last view of the area before heading downhill into Kruger National Park.Kruger National Park, South AfricaAs the sun was getting low to set we entered Kruger National Park, which has 150 mammal species, 110 reptiles species, and over 500 bird species. We hoped to see the Big 5: rhino, elephant, lion, Cape Buffalo, and leopard. There are also the “Ugly 5”: wildebeest, warthog, hyena, the maribou stork, and the leopard faced buzzard.If you don’t get to the rest camp before the gates shut at sundown you will be fined. During the night and early morning hours, only the official park vehicles are allowed on the road. So we were anxious to get to the rest camp but also slowed down as we started to see animals along the side of the road.We headed to Satara Rest Camp and set up our tents as it was getting dark, with plenty of help and advice from Philip and Goodman. Philip made spaghetti Bolognese and salad for dinner, and we made it an early night. We were pleased to see that along with the sleeping bags we each got a cot, mattress, pillow, and blanket. The tents were large enough to stand up and to hold two cots and at least some of our luggage.The facilities were nicer than expected, bathroom blocks with toilet stalls and showers with wooden doors. In general, I have never seen such nice facilities at U.S. national and state parks as we did at all of our stops in Africa. Someone was always in the facilities cleaning something it seemed.Morning Game DriveWe had booked an early morning game drive so we had another early start. We were up at 4 to be picked up at 5. Philip had hot water ready for coffee and tea and rusks to dip. Rusks are like thick biscotti but made from cereal like muesli, really good. (Ouma brand recommended). Philip walked us to reception at 4:45.It was so cold that the guide gave us each a blanket. He gave 2 people on each side spotlights to shine out to spot animals. From 5 to 6 it was dark and we had no sightings. From 6-8 we saw kudu, mongoose, steenbok, and then in the last 10 minutes, we saw two lions sitting near the side of the road. Fabulous! One of the reasons you do early morning or late night drives is that you are more likely to see the carnivores like the big cats at that time. I kept track of where we had gone one our morning game drive with the maps.com iPhone app so I was able to show Goodman and Philip where we had been when we spotted the lions so we drove by that spot but did not find the lions again. We did find a large herd of cape buffalo we had seen previously and a herd of elephants complete with at least 3 very young elephants that were fascinating to watch.Back at the camp, Philip made eggs, bacon, bread, along with leftover pasta sauce. We broke camp and left for Letaba Rest Camp at around 10, watching for game along the way.We stopped at Oliphants overlook, where you look over a watering hole with elephants and hippos. We bought Kruger guide books with pictures of animals in the back that you can check off as you see them.Each of the rest camps has two maps up with magnets on them that mark where people have seen some of the animals. While rhinos are on the map, they do not mark them because this was something that poachers were using to find and kill the animals for their horns. A rhino horn will sell for $100,000 in China. Rhinos are likely to become extinct in my lifetime at the current rate of poaching.We got to camp at 3:30 and set up camp. Philip put out a fruit salad. We took a walk to the river but couldn’t see much there, sat at the restaurant and got drinks, then went to the Elephant Museum, which was really interesting. Philip made lamb chops and sausage, pap (made from maize), and corn for dinner.Evening Game DriveWe headed to reception at 7:45 for our night drive. This time Joan had one of the spotlights. In the first hour, we saw a leopard, hyena pups, and a jackal. The second hour was quieter, though we did see spring hare and scrub hare. The guide was informative and allowed time for photos.Back to camp at 10 and to bed.Departure time was at 7:15. Breakfast at 6:45 was cereal, bread, coffee.Thabaphaswa Farm Stay, South AfricaWe headed west to Thabaphaswa (meaning ‘black and white mountain’ in the local dialect) for a farm stay. We passed by Zion Christian Church, which Goodman told us had 2.5 million people on Easter. The bishop lives in a sort of tower, and he apparently blesses and heals people. The complex was massive.We stopped at a mall for lunch. The mall could easily have been somewhere in the U.S. as it had the same design and some of the same stores.We got to the farm, which had a private reserve next door, and saw nyala, ostriches and their eggs, and monkeys. We were greeted in the driveway by our host and directed to go to the area we’d be staying. It was down a very long rocky dirt road, and when we arrived Philip assigned our rooms, which were buildings at various levels on a rocky hill, connected by cement paths and steps.Each building consisted of 2 or 4 rooms, which each had one full wall made of panes of glass with a door that matched. Each building was painted in a different color. Most had bunk beds or just two twin mattresses on the floor. We brought our sleeping bags and pillows and blankets, and just what we needed for the night, and made up our beds. We had about an hour and a half break before dinner.At 5 we drove to the main house where we sat in chairs in a circle on a patio, with our host as he described the work he has done to bring development and training young people to farm. There were 2 really nice good-sized dogs that greeted us, and another smaller one. We learned the 2 are “boerbulls”.We walked to the cattle pen. The dogs came with us but were very intimidated by the cows. Back at the house, there was now a fire in the center of the circle where we’d sat, and the host talked about the cattle. He breeds for studs and hires out their services, and he offers a cattle hotel so a new farmer can place their cow with him, breed for better offspring, and build up his farm.When Europeans came in they preferred the cattle breeds that they knew but those cattle were less suited for Africa so what they are trying to do is re-introduce the Nguni cattle that the local Bantu peoples raised. These animals are much more resistant to African diseases and the long-horned cattle can protect themselves from predators like leopards. Many a leopard had been killed by farmers trying to protect their prissy European cattle.Dinner was a traditional “braai” or BBQ, starting with a Mopani worm (cooked, crispy), sorghum beer, sausage, lamb and steak, chicken feet, spinach, Coleslaw, pap, and Chakalaka, with pudding for dessert. We could also get wine or beer for a fee.At 9:10 we said goodnight and went back to the rooms. The shower and toilet were outside within a bamboo enclosure, and hot water is provided by a “donkey boiler” which Philip kept heated by building a fire under it. We didn’t know if we’d have hot water in the morning. It was a little colder overnight in the rooms, they are probably not as airtight as the tents.We heard lions in the neighboring game reserve roaring by at least 5 am and got up at 5:30 for our 6:15 breakfast. We were pleased to have hot water for showers, but we still made them very quick as we were outside and the air was very cold. We packed up and met at the van where Philip and Goodman had cereal and tea and coffee ready.Village VisitOur host drove over and we followed his truck. At one point we stopped and he came and explained that we were in the “Platinum belt” and told us about underground and above-ground mining. One of his workers got in our van to go to the village with us to translate.At about 8:30 we arrived at the village for our visit. The buildings are similar to what I see when I do volunteer work in Tijuana, made of cinder block and no indoor toilets. A man from the village was somehow designated to be our guide, and Goodman actually did some translating, and a young man from the village also came over and did the bulk of the initial translation.The man we were visiting with owned a store, so we saw how it is set up, very neat, snacks, dry goods, and also meat. His bedroom is in the same building, and that is the entire building. He also grows vegetables to sell. He showed us his peanut plants and we tried raw peanuts, which tasted like beans. The young man we met had just finished school for mechanical engineering and was looking for an internship, which he said is the typical career starting point. We learned that typically a small percentage of the people in the village works in the mines, and the rest of the people work in support services. They do make their own houses, there is a community cement mixer to make the blocks.One of the things that I like about Intrepid tours is that they usually involve some sort of community connection. It might be visiting a rehabilitation center as we did in Morocco or a village as we did in Cambodia or South Africa.We left the village at around 9:15 and made a stop around 10:10-10:30 to pick up drinks. We drove into Botswana and got to our campsite at Moremi Gorge at around 1:45. We set up camp while Philip made tuna salad and fruit salad for lunch.Moremi Gorge, BotswanaWe started a hike of the Moremi Gorge around 3:30 with an intro and information about a large baobab tree. Philip had already shown us the inside of the fruit, which is hard and which is where we get cream of tartar.We selected walking sticks to use on the hike and got started. The hike crosses a stream river several times, so the sticks were to help keep our balance while walking on rocks. We saw a dassie, and our guide identified several plants including a broom cluster fig and a rock scrambling fig. We saw a plant with a hole dug under it, and the guide said that if a porcupine eats the roots of a plant, it is safe for humans to eat that plant.To complete the hike, we had to climb on boulders that had cables or sections of garden hose attached, definitely more strenuous than we had expected. But we all managed it both up and down. Just before we got to the last waterfall the cables went away and we had to climb around a set of boulders an uncomfortable height off the ground.The waterfalls were very pretty. The hike back was much faster, which was good as it would be getting dark soon. Somehow stepping over the rocks in the stream and all the other aspects of the hike seemed much easier after the bouldering portion. Philip drove us back to camp and made Philip’s Surprise, basically chicken burritos. He had also provided ingredients for a variation on s’mores, with Nutella and Marie’s biscuits in place of chocolate and Graham crackers. They were actually very good!Alex and Eric had bought some cane alcohol, and the campsite actually had a tall counter with a sink which made the perfect bar. Pat had bought wine, and we shared our Port from Stellenbosch.While the rest of us had hiked the gorge, Alex had stayed at the camp, and when we got back he showed us photos of the zebra that had been wandering through the campsite while we were gone. The zebra actually hung around and was just in the trees later in the evening as well.Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, BotswanaWe were up showering at 5:30. We broke camp, had breakfast at 6:45 and were on our way by about 7:30 to drive to Nata. We had a quick bathroom/fuel stop, and a shopping stop from 10:30-11:15, in a really nice SuperSpar market.We got to the Nata rest camp and set up camp. We had a drive scheduled out onto the Makgadikgadi Salt Pans. On the drive, we saw jackals, helicopter birds, ostriches, wildebeests, kori bustards, and zebra.At the salt pan, we saw a huge number of flamingoes in the sunset. In fine African tradition, the numerous vehicles from the rest camp brought coolers of beer and other drinks for a traditional “sundowner”.Philip made poiki for dinner, a traditional stew with kudu meat, made in a dutch oven over the fire.After dinner, Philip took us for a quick walk into the dark around our campsite to find bush babies. Bushbabies are one of the smallest and cutest primates. We only had to look in a few trees before we saw their large eyes staring down at us.Victoria Falls, ZimbabweWe packed up camp and headed out around 7:15 am to head to Victoria Falls. We got to Victoria Falls Rest Camp around 1:30, and Philip and Goodman said they would set up camp for us. (Yay!) We had lunch at the restaurant at the camp, “in Da Belly”. You have to love a restaurant with croc, warthog, and impala on the menu.The camp was right in town, unlike our other camps so far.Philip drove us to the Falls, where we had a guided tour of the viewing point. We were glad that Philip had advised us to wear rain gear and sandals as we definitely got wet. There are more than a dozen different viewing spots and the half to the right get more and more wet. At one it was basically like being in a driving rain.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-928fc4R/0/f68e5013/1280/IMG_6852-1280.mp4The Falls are spectacular, with a rainbow visible for much of the walk, at times a double rainbow. The tour lasted about 2 hours, though you could do it in less.Philip had made reservations at Pariah State, a restaurant close to the camp, at 7. The restaurant was really good. We split a spinach and feta pizza and a chocolate dessert. Joan tried Zambezi beer, Chris had a cider. The entire bill for the 2 of us was $22.We were able to have a later start on the last day, with breakfast around 8. Philip and Goodman kindly took down our tents, before they packed up to drive the van back to Johannesburg. You can normally book this trip either one way as we did or round trip which takes 14+ days and visits some other great sites on the way back to Johannesburg like the Okavango Delta and the Khama Rhino Sanctuary.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-ZRjQWKx/0/3f0480f4/4K/IMG_2191-4K.jpgWe said our goodbyes and put our luggage in storage, and then went with Lis and Alex and Eric to the market in town to look at handicrafts. It was quite an experience, with many vendors all with very similar wooden and stone artwork and lots of haggling and even bartering. Lis gave one of the vendors things from her purse like a tape measure and nail clippers.One of the reasons that people were trying to barter with us for our shirts, shoes, and nicknacks is that Zimbabwe’s economy is quite screwed up after they had runaway hyperinflation. Over 90% of the country are out of work and it is a wonder that the country still functions. But the people we met were friendly, the crafts were great and I was glad we could buy some to take home.Livingstone, ZambiaJoan and I wanted to visit Zambia which is just over the bridge from Victoria Falls. We said our goodbyes, went back to the camp and got a cab for $5 to the border. There we exited Zimbabwe and walked between the two borders, which included crossing the bridge, with additional walking before and after the bridge. It was farther than we expected. At the Zambia side, we got in a line to enter and were behind a group that we thought were also tourists. It was moving slowly if at all, and after about 5 min someone in a uniform came over and told us there were 2 lines and we should be in the other line, which was for tourists. That was much shorter and it went quickly from there.We then got a cab into Livingstone, the town across the border. We shared it with someone and it was about $10 each. On the way, we talked to both the driver and our fellow passenger about Zambia and Zimbabwe. Zambia is doing much better than Zimbabwe due to its better government for the last few decades.The driver and other passenger gave us recommendations for what to do in Livingstone, but since we didn’t have much time, and the crossing had taken longer than we expected, we just got lunch and didn’t try to see more of town.We got a cab back to the border for $10, as listed on a price list the driver showed us, then got a taxi that goes from border to border to avoid the long walk, and then a third cab to the Vic Falls Rest Camp. We had time to sit at the restaurant and have a soda and iced tea before getting our luggage out and waiting for our driver from the Old Drift Lodge to pick us up for our next adventure.What to PackSouth Africa, Botswana Travel Adapter Plug – the right adapter for Southern AfricaOutlet Travel Power Strip Surge Protector with 4 Smart USB Charging Ports – a small surge protector to plug in more things1004 Luci Lux Warm Frosted Decor Light – a collapsable solar lantern for your tentheadlamp – a good headlamp will let you be hands-free in your tentAlso, see What to Pack for a Mobile African Safari for a more detail list.ConclusionIt was interesting seeing Africa, or this corner of Africa at least from ground level on an overland tour. The countries are of a good size so there is a lot of driving on this trip, but there was something interesting to do every day. I would love to go back and do one of the other tours that Intrepid has in southern Africa. I would try and see if we could get Goodman and Philip again if I could!One other surprise is that the trip sounded like our wildlife experiences would mainly be in Kruger National Park. We certainly had great wildlife encounters there, but we also would just see elephants or giraffes or zebra crossing the road some times. The stretch of road from Botswana to Zimbabwe is called the Elephant Highway. Much of it is inside the national parkland.As with all road trips, the most important thing is great traveling companions and, like every other Amateur Traveler trip, we were richly blessed in that regard.See all my Africa photosShare this: "
https://amateurtraveler.com/zimbabwe-safari-lodge/,"Zimbabwe Safari Lodge – The Old Drift Lodge, Luxury in Zambezi National Park",Zimbabwe,"We sat in the lobby of the Old Drift Lodge when a family of three arrived. As they were still drinking their welcome drinks the daughter, a recent college graduate, ran to her mother with child-like glee saying, “mom mom look!”. Her mother turned to face the front of the lodge and just gasped. Outside the front entrance was a herd of elephants including an adorable baby elephant.That gasp and that glee were not an accident. When you build a luxury safari lodge inside the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe right on the banks of the Zambezi River, you are trying to create an amazing experience. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the owners of the lodge placed that man-made watering hole right by the entrance.Table of contents: (Hide)function HideShowTOC() {    var toc = document.getElementById(""toc"");    var button = document.getElementById(""button"");    if (toc.style.display === ""none"") {        toc.style.display = ""block"";        button.textContent=""Hide"";    } else {        toc.style.display = ""none"";        button.textContent=""Show"";    }}Wild HorizonsThe “Old Drift Lodge” NameWhat’s Included at the Old Drift LodgeOld Drift Lodge FacilitiesWildlifeRoomsActivitiesGame DriveWalkSunset CruiseSunrise CruiseVictoria FallsThe FoodThe ExperienceWhen to VisitConclusionWild HorizonsThe company that runs the Old Drift Lodge, Wild Horizons, knows what they are doing. This is their 4th lodge in the area after The Elephant Camp, The Elephant Camp West, and Imbabala Zambezi Safari Lodge. They have also been one of the leading activity companies in the Victoria Falls area of Zimbabwe for many years. The Old Drift Lodge opened in 2018, but we talked to a number of the employees there who had been with Wild Horizons for 8 to 10 years. It seems like every 3rd van and every 5th boat on the Zambezi River has the Wild Horizons logo on it.The “Old Drift Lodge” NameDuring our visit in June of 2019, the name “Old” seemed like an odd moniker on a lodge that opened in 2018, but the lodge is named after the “Old Drift” which was where people crossed the Zambezi River before bridges were built. The lobby of the lodge has pictures of one car ferries that would drift across and down the river to Zambia on the other side. The Old Drift was and is located about 7 kilometers above Victoria Falls so you don’t want to drift too far.What’s Included at the Old Drift LodgeThis is a luxury experience. It includes all meals, drinks, mini-bar drinks in your room, a number of safari and sightseeing activities (see below), transportation, and even laundry services. Don’t underestimate the value of laundry services. We were coming off a one-week overland trip from Johannesburg to Victoria Falls and many of the other guests we met were also coming out of the bush.Old Drift Lodge FacilitiesThe lodge has a central main structure. The main building is a “tent” as are all other buildings of the lodge. The land that the Old Drift Lodge sits on is national park land, so it is not owned by the lodge. Instead, they rent it as a concession. So, in theory, the lodge could be relocated if need be.In the main tent, you will find a welcoming lobby with a bar and fireplaces. There are a few board games like chess and mandala on the tables in the lobby and also a fireplace. It has a series of large tables inside and smaller tables out on the porch for dining. During the beautiful weather of our June visit, no one sat inside for the meals.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Old-Drift-Lodge/i-3JT4MtH/0/524d67fc/S/IMG_6933-S.jpgJust outside the main tent is a fire pit area and a walkway that go down to the dock along the banks of the Zambezi. Wild Horizons has two boats at the dock. One will accommodate about a dozen passengers and the other looks to be set up more for a dining at tables experience.There are 14 rooms or tents for guests. 4 of these are family tents and when we were there I would say about half the guests seemed to be there with kids or grandkids. Half of the rooms (1-7) are one direction from the lodge and the half (8-14) are the other direction along the river.We had room 12 and were about 600 steps from the main area as the rooms are spread out for privacy.WildlifeBecause of where the Old Drift Lodge is positioned, wildlife encounters are an everyday experience. The paths from the lodge to the room have places where the walkway breaks so that wildlife can pass through on the way too and from the river.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Old-Drift-Lodge/i-rT3DHvS/0/d34d005b/1280/IMG_0118-1280.mp4We regularly encountered warthogs around the paths or even one foot from our room’s deck area. There was elephant dung right near our tent and manager Bright told us they have to clean the small pools at the tents often because local elephants like to drink from them. We had to keep the sliding glass doors to our room closed because Vervet Monkeys were often playing near or on the tent. During the hours of darkness, we needed to be escorted to and from our tent, often by one of the guides who would be carrying a rifle.One surprise to me and to Wild Horizons was that the presence of the lodge has discouraged poachers who used to come up river to the park. Wildlife in the park seems to be increasing since the lodge was built.RoomsIt is hard to know what to call the rooms. Is a tent still a tent once it has large picture windows and a sliding glass door, electricity, and plumbing? The room is the size of our first apartment. It has a sitting room, a large comfortable bed facing the river, good storage, and a large bathroom with a toilet area, duals sinks and a large shower. Outside the room on the patio is an outdoor shower, an outdoor bath with privacy curtains, a table and chairs, two chaise lounges and a small pool. The pool would probably be more popular in the hot summer months as it is heated by the sun and was chilly in June.The room also had good wi-fi and numerous electrical outlets including one each side of the bed which could take a U.S. Africa and Europe plug. There were also at least 3 USB outlets, 2 of which were located next to the bed. The electrical plugs in Zimbabwe, in general, are the 3 pronged round Africa style plug so you will need an adaptor if you are coming from Europe or the U.S.There was a stocked mini-bar in the room that came stocked with wine, mixed drinks, and soft drinks. A quick call to the main number and ours was stocked with Coke Zero instead of Coke. The mini-bar is free.There was also an electric kettle to heat water for tea and coffee, a French roast press and a jar of cookies in the room. The room has a hair dryer, an ice machine, and even a hair straightener. There were large bottles of water that we could use to refill the glass water bottles that they give all the guests to cut down on the use of plastic bottles. When they picked us up in the van the first time they handed us a plastic water bottle, so that was a bit of a mixed message.Our room was a stone’s throw from the river’s edge but we were encouraged not to venture down to the river which is the home to both hippos and crocodiles. We saw neither near our room during our stay.ActivitiesYour stay includes 2 included activities a day according to the official documentation in our room, although the staff did not mention that particular limit so it might be fungible. Many of these are at sunrise and at sunset which are the best time for game spotting and for some great pictures.Game DriveWild Horizons has at least 3 safari vehicles at the lodge. These are the traditional open vehicles that seat 10 passengers in elevated seating and the driver/guide. They run game drives morning and evening and we did both.Like any game drive, there is some skill of your guide and a lot of luck involved in seeing wildlife. This is not a zoo but a 219 square mile (567 square kilometers) park and the game will move around.On the first drive we did in the afternoon we encountered elephants including a startling encounter with a young male that tried to intimidate us. He would raise his feet as if he was going to charge and even trumpeted at us from 10 feet away. Everyone in the vehicle, except our guide Khule, were properly intimidated but Khule explained that this was basically a teenage male acting out. Elephants are matriarchal so only if the lead female elephant looks uncomfortable do you need to worry.We also saw giraffes, kudu, waterbuck, impala, warthogs, zebra and many many different species of birds. We learned that ants will launch attacks on nearby termite mounds. We learned that warthogs often kneel to eat. We learned that giraffes move their left feet at the same time and then their right when they run.The afternoon game drive ends with a traditional sundowner drink. Our stop was at the top of a hill by a baobab tree.Morning game drives conclude with tea. We had tea along the banks of the river.WalkWe did not get a chance to do a game walk as we were only at the camp for 2 nights and there were too many things to do. While we were on the morning game drive we did not see as many of the big animals like elephants, giraffes or zebras, but Khule who did the guided walk that day said his group saw all of them. That morning they kept themselves further in the bush away from the tracks that the vehicles were taking.Sunset CruiseWe took the sunset cruise the second night we were at the camp. This is a popular activity along the river. We cruised towards the falls but they boats stay at least 2 kilometers away from the edge. There are 3 main channels and a number of islands in the river between Zimbabwe and Zambia in this stretch here of the Zambezi. The river is wide and is filled with hippos.Our sharp-eyed guide Levi spotted two baby crocodiles along the banks of the river and one 1 meter (3 feet) long young croc. The crocodiles in the area can grow to as long as 5 meters (18 feet).We saw elephants and other wildlife coming down to drink from the river. We did all this while sipping our wine or other drinks that were available on the boat. The cruise ended with a spectacular sunset.Sunrise CruiseWhile the river was full of boats at sunset, we were one of a very small number of boats that went out on the mist covered river to see the sunrise and to look again for what wildlife would come down to the banks of the river.We saw a water monitor lizard and a number of hippos that had returned to the river after foraging for grass all night on land. Mornings in Zimbabwe in winter can be cold so we were dressed with layers. The lodge also provided blankets and a hot water bottle for us to hold on our laps. The boat was stocked with hot coffee, tea, other libations, and cookies.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Victoria-Falls/i-928fc4R/0/f68e5013/1280/IMG_6852-1280.mp4Victoria FallsWe did not take the Victoria Falls excursion, simply because we had already visited the falls by the time we came to the lodge. A visit to the falls is pretty much mandatory. The falls are usually the reason that people are in this part of Zimbabwe. So not surprisingly the lodge will take people the 20 minutes back to Victoria Falls to experience this awesome display. Some other guests were also getting rides back to town to shop, take high tea at the Victoria Falls Hotel or just explore the town.The Food At breakfast, there is an good breakfast buffet set out as well as items that you can order from the menu like an English breakfast, omelets, and pancakes.https://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Old-Drift-Lodge/i-jzRKHTC/0/fd9a2d57/S/IMG_6906-S.jpghttps://photos.smugmug.com/Africa/Zimbabwe/Old-Drift-Lodge/i-jzRKHTC/0/fd9a2d57/S/IMG_6906-S.jpgThe ExperienceThis was not my first African safari lodge experience so I had a better idea what to expect when we arrived. So I had a chance to enjoy my wife’s reaction as we pulled up in a safari vehicle to the lodge and were greeted warmly by various staff members. They brought us fresh wet cloths to freshen up from the trip as they did each time we returned from a game drive or boat trip. They introduced themselves throughout our stay and were extremely attentive. In short, they treated us in the fashion to which we would like to become accustomed. We enjoyed meeting the other guests on our various game drives or boat cruises. On our first game drive we were having so much fun talking that our guide was concerned we would scare away the game. When to VisitWe visited in Winter in early June. The weather was perfect as the rainy season was over. It was not as hot as it was during my visit to the area the previous December. The mornings were chilly but that also meant, that in 2 weeks in Africa I think I only saw one mosquito. During the day the temperature would climb up to shirt sleeve weather. ConclusionThe Old Drift Lodge is not a budget experience. It is a luxury experience and it is a great experience. The lodge had only been opened for a year when we visited, but I will be willing to bet you that they will have guests return to visit them again and again and again.Check out all my photos of the Old Drift Lodge and of Zambezi National Park.Our stay at the Old Drift Lodge was sponsored by Wild Horizons and coordinated by Botswana Trek but all opinions are my own.</emShare this: "
