We found a bar called AB Hotel near our hostel in Glebe Village that served $8 AU jugs of good beer. Which is extremely cheap by Australian standards.Alcohol costs and arm and a leg! You can drop $80 on a 6 pack of good beer. The bar also had a huge upstairs that we ended up having all to ourselves and free wifi.I later learned the reason for the insane beer prices in Australia. The government taxes alcohol and cigarettes like crazy in order to pay for the hospital bills that it causes. Which makes sense since they have socialized medicine and when people go to the hospital or doctor they pay little or nothing for care. I wonder if this will happen to beer prices in the US??? I hope not. Glebe Village Backpackers HostelAt Glebe Village Backpackers Hostel, we met a couple of nice and very helpful Germans who gave us some tips about the city and the buses. The hostel was not bad for $24 AU/per person and they made pancakes in the morning that were delicious!They also have free BBQ on Friday nights. Just some wonder bread, a few hot dogs and hamburgers. But hey, it’s free. I wasn’t too stoked on the fact that there are no lockers or safes anywhere in the hostel, especially when you are sharing a room.Since we had no idea where we wanted to go in Sydney, we just hopped on the bus and headed toward downtown. The bus driver was super informative and she was very enthusiastic about helping us plan our itinerary. We ended up fitting a lot into one day.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					We walked the harbor bridge, checked out the opera house, went to the Royal Botanical Gardens (free admission might I add), and took another bus to Bondi Beach. The botanical gardens were full of flying foxes. I guess this is seasonal and you won’t always get to see them, but there were hundreds of them in the trees and flying around. They make a lot of noise and are pretty entertaining to watch.If you are in Sydney and not sure where to go like we were, there is a free tour that starts at Town Hall Station by the anchor at 10:30 am. It takes you to 3 different places, one being the opera house. We are not big city people, so one day in Sydney for us was enough, and after that we were ready to rent our campervan and get on the road.Driving the van out of Sydney was stressful considering it’s a big city and we were driving on the opposite side of the road than we do in the US! One of the hardest things to get used to was that the blinkers and windshield wipers are also on the opposite sides of the steering wheel.Since driving is second nature to a lot of people, it is almost impossible to break the habit of wanting to use your right hand to turn on your signal. But instead the windshield wipers will come on and it causes even more frustration and confusion. It was pretty comical how many times we did that.In order to get out of Sydney, you have to pass a few tolls. But they can’t just let you pay the tolls as you go through them. You have to go online to each website for each toll you pass within 48 hours and give them your credit card or they will fine you. Our camper van company charges $50 per toll! NewcastleSince we decided not to bring any wetsuits on this trip, our best option was to continue north in search of warmer water. Our drive from Sydney to Newcastle took 2 1/2 hours. We managed to find the last site available at Redhead Beach Holiday Park. Since it was Easter break, everything was booked and the prices were jacked up. We paid $40 for our first night of “camping”.I say camping in quotations because the camping we experienced in Australia was nothing like the camping we are used to. First of all, most people have a sink, a fridge and a stove in their van. Some people even brought huge televisions to watch outdoors and we saw a couple of washer/dryers.Second, at every park we encountered, there was at least one camp kitchen that has everything you would find in a normal kitchen. Most places have pools and laundry rooms, some have tennis courts and there is usually a game room. We were really roughing it!At Redhead Holiday Park there is a nice trail to the beach and sand dunes. There are also some decent surf spots according to the locals. The night we were there, the sky was really dark blue and everything looked surreal and beautiful. It’s a great place to take pictures of the sand dunes with the ocean as a backdrop.The next morning we waited until the Kuta Lines Surf Shop across the street opened at ten and prayed they would be selling some used boards since we didn’t have any luck finding boards to buy in Sydney. The girl working there was extremely helpful and suggested some good places to stop along our way up North.We found two surfboards at the shop for $200 AU each. A couple of beaters, but the price was right and we knew we would be chucking them in ten days anyway. MerewetherWe had read about the Merewether Baths, just 10 minutes North of Newcastle, so we stopped there for a little photo opportunity. The waves were head high or bigger, breaking really quick, and it looked like a place for kamikazes only. We watched the surfers for a bit and continued to make our way up North.We stopped along the way at a great little restaurant called the “Salty Dog”. They had extremely fresh fish and chips and a steak sandwich that was to die for. Crescent HeadIt took about 4 hours to get to Crescent Head, our destination for the evening. Crescent Head Holiday Park was a step up from Redhead. The best part about this place, besides the waves, was the cafe. It was refreshingly cheap and healthy food. A nice change from dropping $30 at the grocery store for about 5 items. They also have 5 or 6 computers for you to purchase internet.The next morning we checked the surf and decided it was worth a shot to paddle out. It’s mostly beach break, with one point break near the park. We would have enjoyed staying here longer, but we knew warmer water awaited us further up North. Yamba and AngourieYamba, they say, is a sleepy little town. By sleepy I think they mean everything closes early (by about 7pm). They have fresh seafood right off the boat and a ferry to Iluka which is a nature reserve. It’s $6 each way but be careful because it is sleepy too. The last one back to Yamba is at 4pm.There are three caravan parks in Yamba. The Blue Dolphin (close to the river and marinas), Calypso Holiday Park (close to the lighthouse, beaches and ferry, but sites are right on top of each other), and Yamba Waters Holiday Park (quieter, bigger sites, good facilities and probably the cheapest).We parked our van at Yamba Waters and paid a mere $25 AU, which was cheap compared to our previous $40 sites. We found out later that this park is near a lagoon, which brought on the mosquitoes. Even though we got eaten up pretty bad, I would still recommend staying here. We were also pretty stoked to find a cheap grocery store called Bi-Lo, where we stocked up on camping food.Our campsite was only 5 minutes from the gorgeous Angourie Nature Reserve and the world renowned surf spot, Angourie Point. Angourie Point is a right hand point break with some decent beach break on the other side of the rocks.In addition to uncrowded and good waves, Angourie also boasts 2 natural swimming holes right next to the ocean. They call these the green pool and the blue pool. But after some rain, they both turn into brown pools. Here you will find many tourists jumping off cliffs into the pools.After spending 2 amazing days surfing Angourie and checking out the area, we decided to continue our journey up the eastern coast of Australia in search of another great wave. Broken HeadBroken Head is a little town just 7 km South from the hustle and bustle of Byron Bay. We found Broken Head Holiday Park in our GPS, as we did with many of the parks we ended up staying at in Australia. The parks in the GPS were not always great, but we usually had good luck with the ones that were within walking distance to a beach.This particular campground is surrounded by stunning views north and south. There is a fun surf break here that has a fast peeling right hand wave, best in swells with a S-SW wind. There is a 1.6 Km trail from the park that winds through a reserve with dense rainforest, which then opens out to cliffs with views of the crystal clear water below and the Two Sisters Rocks.At the end of the trail is a secluded beach called Kings Beach and a nice place to chill for a while. As we were leaving the beach, a couple of people arrived with a tent, so I’m guessing this may be a cool spot to camp for the night. But please check the tides first!Before we set up camp that night, we decided we had enough mosquito bites all over our bodies from the previous 2 nights, so we headed to Byron Bay to find some mosquito netting that we could cover the windows of our van with. Our sleep in Yamba consisted of choosing between either the feeling of suffocation by no air flow in the van with all the windows closed, or giving the bugs a free for all while we were sleeping.We couldn’t find any mosquito netting, but we did find some thin dish rags and packing tape. We must have looked pretty ghetto back at our campsite with me holding the dish rags for Scott, while he taped them up to the moon roof and windows of the van. It actually was a topic of conversation a little later in the evening with our neighbors, 2 Aussies.These two guys were extremely interesting and informative. They were on a six-week trip of the east coast of Australia since they had never seen the North or the Great Barrier Reef. Naturally, we had all sorts of questions to ask about things we had encountered on our trip thus far.For example, the bugs and creatures of Australia. We learned that the bug which we thought was a horse fly, was actually called a mud fly and they give nasty bites. We had first come across this bug in Angourie, and at first it acted and looked like a bee. It had stripes like a bee and chased like a bee when you tried to swat it away. Upon further investigation, I had decided it was harmless and told Scott that I thought it was a fly. So he let one land on him and it just sat there for a while until Scott flicked it off.The next day he had a large bite on his hand. Come to find out, these flies draw blood just like a mosquito, but the bite is much worse and it itches like crazy. Oops! Sorry, Scott! [:o] From now on I will take the advice of our new Aussie friends. “If you don’t know what it is, assume it bites, because most things do in OZ”.It was also interesting to learn about the starfish that are now living in the Great Barrier Reef that are not native to Australia. These starfish were introduced by boats and fisherman from China. They are now eating away at the Great Barrier Reef and no other fish can eat them!Apparently we have been saying the names of most cities in Australia incorrectly. Cairns is cans, Melbourne is melbun, Brisbane is brisbun and Bondi is bondai. Good to know. Now we can speak Australian.And now I don’t feel so bad about not tipping at a restaurant in Australia. The wait staff make between $17 to $23 per hour and that is how they can afford to not receive tips from customers. While we are on the subject, most employees in Australia make at least $15 per hour for any job. It didn’t sound like they have a minimum wage, but we were told that only the young kids make less than $15. Byron BayThe next morning we packed up the van and drove seven km to Byron Bay to check the surf since there was no swell hitting Broken Head. We checked a point break by the light house and it looked really small and super crowded. But it was a beautiful, warm day and we were in Australia, so we paddled out anyway.The ocean water in Byron Bay is blue-green and we could see all the way to the bottom. I can’t say much for the waves that day, and we spent most of our time trying not to get hit by longboards. San Diego’s version of a party wave is nothing compared to 20 people scrambling to catch a 1-2 foot wave on a crowded peak in Byron Bay. But it was fun, nonetheless.The town of Byron is full of backpackers and driving through the streets is a pedestrian hazard. If you are looking for a cheap meal, which is often the case while visiting this country, check out Eagle Pizza for some good deals. This town overall was too crowded for us, so we continued up the Gold Coast. Our drive up the Gold Coast was slightly disappointing.We saw a lot of big sky scrapers and busy cities. Needless to say, we moved through this stretch of coast fairly quickly.We stopped at Palm Beach for a bite to eat (another delicious wrap) and a look at the ocean. As we drove through the streets of Surfer’s Paradise, in between tall buildings, we realized this was no longer a surfer’s paradise and moved on. Our new plan was to hit the Sunshine Coast before dark.That’s when we hit our first bit of bumper to bumper traffic on the M1. This shifted our route to a place called Beerwah, near the Glass House Mountains, and we stayed in a creepy run down caravan park straight out of an 80’s horror film. The camp kitchen was full of spiders and when I took a shower I had the feeling a killer would slash through the shower curtain at any moment. Our neighbors near our campsite were very friendly though, so that made up for the scary vibe. Australia ZooBeerwah is about 15 minutes from the Australia Zoo, so after our creepy night in a run down caravan park we got an early start to go see some crocs! I wasn’t expecting much from our visit to the zoo since most of the times I have been to a zoo I go home disappointed when I realize the most interesting animals are sleeping during the day. Or I can’t see through the cages to get a good picture.We had planned to only spend a few hours, but ended up spending 5 without even scratching the surface of what they have to offer. We were very impressed with the crocodile show that was performed by the Irwins. I’ve never seen a live show with crocodiles and I was honestly afraid for the people on stage. They could have been taken down at any moment if something went wrong!! Definitely a highlight of the trip.The other animals were equally impressive because they all seemed so much happier than they do at a lot of zoos. We really got the feeling like the animals are well taken care of and that they enjoy being there. The cages were not chain link, so it was easier to take photos. The habitat of the Red Panda was a wall about waist to chest high and that was it! It seemed the animals would be able to get out if they wanted.We also saw a cheetah out of its cage with a couple of zoo employees and 2 tourists that were petting it. Another highlight for me was the Roo Heaven where we were able to feed and pet all the kangaroos roaming around. Maroochydore, AustraliaOur visit to the Sunshine Coast was bittersweet. We were in search of warm water and some waves. We found the warm water, but the surf forecast said no waves would be hitting this area for about 5 days, which was after we had to drop off our campervan to get ready for our flight to Thailand.Our night in Maroochydore, we spent at Sea Breeze Caravan Park at a site that was practically on the beach. It’s a nice place and we would have stayed longer if we were not in desperate need of some waves. The next morning we drove to Noosa Heads, about 30 minutes north, where we found a posh getaway for people interested in shopping and lavish dinner cruises. In search of surf, and less touristy venues, we set our sights back below the Gold Coast to a little town called Cabarita. CabaritaCabarita, Australia is a laid back, small town on the Tweed Coast. Thankfully, the town has protected wetlands that limit the amount of development and this gives it that small town feel where everybody knows everybody. We found Cabarita to be heaven on earth and a perfect place to spend our last days in Australia. The North Star Holiday Resort that we stayed at was huge and had everything you could possibly need.We arrived on a Sunday night and went to the neighboring Pottsville in search of some dinner. We found the most unique restaurant and pizza joint called “White Jade”. We ordered a garlic and prawns pizza that was unlike anything we have ever tasted before. The staff was very friendly and there seemed to be a ton of regulars.The next morning we found Hastings Point in Cabarita and enjoyed an early and uncrowded surf session. Hastings has both a North and a South facing peak, so you get to take your pick depending on what the swell is doing that day. We ate lunch overlooking the water and soaking up the views.After lunch we explored the Tweed Coast a bit by campervan and ended up getting stuck in a rainstorm. We spent the rest of the day waiting out the rain in our camp kitchen, eating and watching Australian Animal Planet. After the rain let up, we headed back to Hastings Point for a quick sunset surf.We spent the next morning admiring Hastings in and out of the water. A wind swell had come in the night before and caused some pretty junky surf, so it was quite a work out just to paddle out. We really didn’t want to leave this place, but the surf report promised better waves in Broken Head. So we set out for our final night back at Broken Head Holiday Park and were greeted with some chest high fast breaking waves to finish off our trip.The night brought some torrential rain and a rush in middle of the night to grab our towels and such left to dry. We arose to mud covered boards and a beautiful sunrise over the ocean. On our way out of Byron we sold our boards at the local pawn shop and headed back to Jucy to return our bright green and purple accommodations in the Fortitude Valley part of Brisbane.Our stay in Brisbane was a short one. After we had dropped off the van, we were just looking to kill some time before the last air tram left for the airport. The air tram stops running at 7:28 pm and doesn’t start up again until after 5 am. Since our flight left before 7 am, we figured we might as well just sleep at the airport since the tram didn’t start early enough and a cab ride would have cost $50 or more.During our visit to Brisbane, we did stumble upon a street mall with many different restaurants and food shops. It was a Wednesday and most restaurants were having Wednesday night specials that we couldn’t pass up. We ended up at Ric’s Cafe & Bar and were able to share a huge plate of fish, chips and steak for $8.Now we must say goodbye to Australia, but not before we spend a lovely night in the Brisbane airport! Read More:10 Common Travel Scams & How to Avoid ThemHow to Take a Road Trip in AustraliaInsider Tips: How To Find Cheap Flights To AnywhereThe Ultimate Packing Checklist for Campers10 Best Free Campgrounds in Northern CaliforniaThe Ultimate Road Trip Packing List (Must-Have Essentials!)My 25 Best Travel Tips After 10 Years of Traveling the World "

My last visit consisted of mostly beach bumming, so I wanted to explore a little more of the island on this recent trip. From spending the day with flamingos to snorkeling with sea life, here are ten things you won’t want to miss on your next trip to Aruba. Table of Contents10 Best Things To Do In ArubaTake a Snorkel CruiseSpend the Day with FlamingosRide to Conchi on HorsebackVisit Eagle BeachFloat in Palm BeachKaraoke at Bugaloe Beach Bar & GrillDrift in Mangel HaltoRide on a Banana BoatVisit the California LighthouseTry ZeeroverPlan Your Trip to Aruba10 Best Things To Do In Aruba Take a Snorkel CruiseSnorkel cruises let you bask on a boat in the sun (or shade) with live music, food, and drinks, then stop by the snorkeling spots for a little underwater exporation. The Pelican Adventures cruise also brings you to the S.S. Antilla, a famous WWII shipwreck that is one of the largest in the Caribbean. Spend the Day with FlamingosRenaissance Island is a private island for guests of the Renaissance Resort & Casino, so it’s away from the crowds though you can share company with flamingos on one of the beaches. Even if you are not staying at this hotel, you can purchase a day pass to the island to snap a picture with the pink beauties for a postcard-worthy photo. Ride to Conchi on HorsebackIf you don’t mind getting up early, take a sunrise horseback ride to the conchi, or natural pool, surrounded by volcanic rock on Aruba’s north side. Take in the colors of the landscape, and when you reach the pool, you’ll be ready for a swim. There aren’t any ready amenities — just lots of natural beauty.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Visit Eagle BeachEagle Beach has been named one of the best beaches in the world. It’s popular, but with a vast coast and soft white sands, it’s still a perfect place to relax. In the summer months, you may even spot sea turtles hatching around sunset and at night. Float in Palm BeachPalm Beach is renowned for its calm waters, making it easy to float on a rubber raft and soak up the sun. Raft rentals are usually $5 a day, but if you’ve got room in your bags, you can bring your own and float whenever you want. Karaoke at Bugaloe Beach Bar & GrillBungaloe is a laid-back beach house on the water of Palm Beach, with open walls and a classic grass roof. On Saturday nights, they host karaoke with a happy hour during the event — just in case you need a boost to take the stage and sing your heart out. Drift in Mangel HaltoA favorite of the locals, the calm waters of Mangel Halto are perfect for skimming on stand-up paddleboards and snorkeling. It’s a beautiful reef with colorful fish, and a guided drift snorkel lets you swim easily along with the current to see it. Ride on a Banana BoatIn Palm Beach, you can find banana boats — big inflatable rafts that can seat ten or so people pulled by a speedboat. Bouncing on the waves makes it hard to hang on, but that’s part of the fun! Where there are banana boats, there is laughter and smiles. Visit the California LighthouseA scenic white lighthouse near the northwest tip of Aruba, the California Lighthouse is a popular drive-and-park destination for couples. It offers a beautiful overlook, and nearby are the California White Sand Dunes to get in some hiking. Try ZeeroverZeerover is a small, local eatery in the fishing village of Saventa where you can get delicious seafood at good prices, fresh off the boat. The fried fish and jumbo shrimp come with sides like Aruban pancakes and fried plantains for a hearty meal. You can even play a game of domino while you wait, or take your food to go and have a picnic on the beach! “Adventure in Aruba” Video Where to Stay in Aruba:During this recent visit to the island, I stayed at the Hilton Aruba, which is situated right on Palm Beach. The view from my balcony was breathtaking and I had one of the best meals of my trip at their beachfront restaurant — complete with live entertainment. The property has two pools, dozens of beach palapas, 5 restaurants, and it’s an easy 22 minutes from the airport. Plan Your Trip to ArubaAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/where-to-stay-aruba-marriott-resort,Pristine Beaches and Warm Hospitality at Aruba Marriott Resort,Aruba,"There is definitely a reason why travelers keep coming back to Aruba Marriott, year after year. I can’t tell you how many people I met who raved about this resort and mentioned that they make an annual appearance due to the beautiful scenery and Aruban hospitality.Aruba is a small island — just 19.6 miles long — and boasts ideal temperatures year round, thanks to the constant trade winds (which helps with the humidity and limits the annoyance of mosquitoes). When travel to other islands in the Caribbean is dicey, Aruba is the optimal choice because it is located in the Netherland Antilles, outside of the hurricane belt.I am normally a mosquito magnet in tropical areas, but I came home from Aruba without a single bug bite. That’s reason enough for me to move Aruba to the top of my tropical island list. How to Get to Aruba MarriottAruba Marriott is a quick 30-minute cab ride from the airport. Upon arrival, the bellhop immediately offered to save me from my bags while I checked in at the front desk. The check-in process was quick and easy — with a brief overview of the resort’s grounds and available activities. Aruba Marriott Resort ReviewRoomsI was impressed with the decor of the room and, of course, the remarkable beach view from my private balcony. All guest rooms are equipped with a safe, mini fridge, hair dryer, and large walk-in closet. The high-speed Wi-Fi worked flawlessly in my room (I never had any problems connecting from the beach either). As a person who is sensitive to cigarette smoke, I appreciate the smoke-free policy in the hotel. Room prices start at $209 per night, which is not outrageous — especially for Aruba. The Beach at Aruba MarriottThe beach was definitely my favorite part of this resort (and this is coming from a self-proclaimed beach connoisseur). Sometimes a white sand beach and a raft is all you need for the perfect vacation. The sand in front of the resort is groomed, so you don’t have to worry about stepping on any sharp pieces of coral and you won’t be bothered by boats as long as you stay inside the roped-off area.One of the lovely staff members will even set up lounge chairs for you under a Palapa, which you can keep for the day as long as you don’t leave for longer than two hours. But seriously, why would you want to?They will even offer to take your photo. By the time I left the resort, I felt like the beach staff and I were old friends.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 BarI didn’t spend too much time at the bar, except to grab a beer on my way to the hot tub. The service was quick and pleasant and I don’t ask for too much more from a hotel bar. BreakfastI experienced room service breakfast and the buffet at La Vista Restaurant. The food wasn’t anything spectacular — pretty much what you would expect from buffet or room service — but the service was always top notch. I do wish they offered a little more selection of food at the buffet, but honestly it kept me from overeating like I normally do at buffet breakfasts. Simply Fish RestaurantFor the ultimate dinner-on-the-beach-with-live-music experience, we spent an evening dining at Simply Fish Restaurant. You will only find the freshest fish on the menu and I highly recommend the Grouper with crunchy macadamia crust. Mandara Spa at Aruba MarriottMandara Spa is situated on Aruba Marriott’s property — offering massages, wraps, scrubs and other unique spa treatments. Must-Do Activities in ArubaIf lounging under a Palapa or floating on a raft all day isn’t your thing, there is plenty more to experience in Aruba.Jet Pack: I have yet to try this, but I loved watching other people take a stab at it.  SUP: Stand Up Paddleboarding on Aruba’s calm waters is a fun way to get on the water and give those abs and arms a workout.Beach Tennis: This is more like paddle ball with a net, but it’s surprisingly fun and you will get a great workout running around on the sand.Linda’s Dutch Pancakes and Pizza: Have you ever had Dutch Pancakes? This was my first time and now I’m hooked! You can choose from sweet or savory — I recommend the brie, walnut and honey pancake. Snorkeling: Aruba is the perfect place for snorkeling. If you head to the other side of the island, then don’t miss Baby Beach; it’s where the locals hang out. Carubbian Festival: I wasn’t sure what to expect from the Carubbian Festival, but it ended up being a blast. Every Thursday night, performers put on shows, dress up, dance in the streets and vendors serve amazing local food. You can book tickets for this festival with De Palm Tours or at the hotel concierge. Plan Your Trip to ArubaAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights:Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/homemade-tsatsiki-sauce-recipe,Easy Homemade Tzatziki Sauce Recipe,Belgium," Easy Homemade Tzatziki Sauce RecipeOne of the things I’ve been attempting at home is to practice making recipes from all over the world. Since we travel so much, I figure the best way to learn new recipes is by taking a cooking class whenever we’re in a new country.After taking a cooking class in Italy in 2012 — where we learned how to make pasta from scratch — I quickly realized this is a great way to immerse ourselves in the local culture while traveling. Our travel schedules don’t always allow us to take a cooking class, but we are going to do our best to include one.On my recent trip to Brussels, I took a cooking class at Mmmmh! to learn how to make four different Mediterranean dishes. Brussels is such an international city (known as the capital of Europe) which means you won’t just find traditional Belgian dishes taught in the cooking classes. There’s a mix of cuisine in this city, so I picked Mediterranean food because it’s something that has always appealed to me.The Tzatziki sauce we made in the class was some of the best I’ve tasted — and it can be paired with so many different dishes — so I thought it would be the perfect recipe to share with you. Tzatziki Sauce Recipe Ingredients:400g Greek Yoghurt5 Tbsp of Olive Oil1 Sprig of Mint2 Cloves of Garlic1 CucumberSaltBlack Pepper Tzatziki Sauce Recipe Preparation:1. Peel and seed the cucumber.2. Chop the flesh, salt lightly and remove excess water by pressing into a clean cloth.3. Peel and mince two cloves of garlic.4. Chop the mint.5. Mix the yogurt with cucumber, a little oil, garlic, mint leaves, salt, and pepper.6. Refrigerate.Suggestion: Prepare Tzatziki in advance and leave in the fridge for 2 or 3 days — it will only get better!Read More:Where to Stay in Cinque Terre (And the Best Hotels in Each Village)Rome Travel Tips: Everything You Need to Know Before VisitingJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					My 25 Best Travel Tips After 10 Years of Traveling the WorldWhere to Stay in Rome: A Guide to the Best Neighborhoods15 Best Weekend Getaways in Europe10 Affordable Honeymoon Destinations for Every Budget "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/antwerp-belgium-travel-guide,"The Best Things To Do In Antwerp, Belgium",Belgium,"The Dutch-speaking city of Antwerp should be on every traveler’s list when visiting Belgium. Despite my best efforts, I arrived in Antwerp after sunset and was unable to get my bearings during daylight hours. Yet somehow, I still felt safe on my walk to dinner that evening and immediately fell in love with this city.Even though Dutch is predominantly taught in Schools here, you’ll hear a mix of languages spoken — including English, German and French — so it’s an extremely tourist-friendly destination. And because the city is surprisingly small, the list below can easily be done on a three-day visit. Here are the 7 best things to do in Antwerp, Belgium! The Best Things To Do In Antwerp, Belgium Grote Markt in Old TownI had dinner reservations on the night of my arrival, so I set off on foot to find Dock’s Cafe — using confusing directions from the receptionist at my hotel. After a frustrating day of train delays, I opted to cancel my dinner plans and instead stumbled upon Grote Markt and Old Town Antwerp.This area of Antwerp is definitely my favorite because of the unlimited restaurant options and stunning architecture. Old Town is also where you will find the Cathedral of our Lady (the tallest building in downtown Antwerp) and Silvius Brabo (the famous hand statue and how Antwerp got its name). Because of its size, the Cathedral is a great reference point to avoid getting lost in this part of the city. The Chocolate Line Shop in Grand Meir PalaceThe Chocolate Line is a gorgeous chocolate shop and is located in Grand Meir Palace, which was at one time owned by both the Belgian Royal Family and Napoleon. You can buy a variety of unique handmade chocolates here — including Earl Grey, cannabis, bacon and cigar-flavored chocolate squares. Cellar Restaurants & Beer Tastings!I absolutely loved the underground restaurants in Antwerp. These dungeon-like cellars serve food that ranges from French and Belgian to medieval cuisine. That’s right, you can reserve a table at De Grootte Ganz and taste traditional medieval dishes eaten with a spoon and your hands!I ordered the beer tasting at De Pelgrom (in the same cellar as De Grootte Ganz) and it came with four healthy tastings of Belgian beer and a block of cheese for 11 Euro. Estro Armonico is another cave-restaurant, located a block or two away from De Pelgrom and it gets excellent reviews for its Belgian cuisine.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Dock’s CafeI did eventually make it to the Michelin-approved restaurant, Dock’s Cafe, located along the docks of the Scheldt river. The French and Italian-inspired cuisine and extremely fresh oyster bar definitely deserves its Michelin Star status. I highly recommend the savory duck with leeks and potatoes. I was actually sad that I don’t like oysters because their bar looks tempting. Antwerpen-Central Railway StationDid you know that Antwerp has one of the prettiest train stations in the world? Apparently, this 19th Century building is listed as one of the top three most beautiful railway stations. Even if you’re not arriving or departing by train, it’s a must see for the photo opportunities alone. InvincibleInvincible is a hip restaurant with a menu that changes daily. I suggest reserving a seat in the kitchen, where you can watch the cooks prepare everyone’s meal from start to finish. The waitstaff and chef really know how to pair local beers to compliment each dish. Goossens Bakery & Philip’s BiscuitsGoossens has been around since 1884 and it’s extremely popular with the locals, which means you absolutely have to try it. You can’t miss this small shop if you arrive in the morning because there will be a line out the door. Right next door is Philip’s Biscuits and it’s also a local favorite. Don’t forget to try the delicious, buttery Antwerp Hand cookie — it’s a great gift to bring home as well. Plan Your Trip to AntwerpWhere to Stay: Staying within walking distance from Old Town is ideal if you want to visit the locations mentioned in this post. I stayed at Hotel Les Nuits and walked everywhere.Antwerp also has a bike sharing program called Velo Antwerpen, so if you would prefer to experience the city like the locals, I suggest getting on a bike!How to Get There: I flew from the USA with Air Berlin and took a two-hour train ride from my first travel destination in Germany. Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights. It searches hundreds of sites for the best fare and includes both standard and budget airlines. The price calendar feature shows the cheapest days to fly in your preferred month of travel.Antwerp is the perfect base for a day trip to the stunning town of Bruges — which I highly recommend visiting.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/brussels-best-beer-pubs,"Must-Visit Beer Pubs in Brussels, Belgium",Belgium,"Do you travel to try different types of food? How about to sample local wine, beer or scotch? I travel for many different reasons, but tasting local brews is one of the first things I do when visiting a new destination.I love a good San Diego IPA or Northern California Microbrew, but over the past few years I’ve developed a fondness for Belgian beers. Chimay is popular in San Diego, but it’s not cheap; so when I found myself with unlimited options of Belgian beer in Brussels — including inexpensive Chimay — I could have sworn I was in beer heaven.I spent the majority of my time in Brussels eating Belgian Waffles and enjoying a wide variety of beer. Here are 3 must-visit beer pubs in Brussels, Belgium!  Must-Visit Beer Pubs in Brussels, Belgium PoechenellekelderPoechenellekelder has indoor and outdoor seating and the interior is decorated with puppets which were used in the puppet theater downstairs before it closed. A local suggested I visit this place because of its large selection of Belgian beers and I wasn’t disappointed — besides the fact that I couldn’t try them all. You’ll find their menu of beers online. I highly recommend the Westmalle Tripel.If you plan on visiting the famous Manneken Pis statue, it’s conveniently located right across from Poechenellekelder, so you could easily kill two birds with one stone.

This cafe is at the end of a small alley, off of one of the busiest restaurant streets in Brussels. The bartender was happy to offer his suggestions and poured me a glass of Houblon Chouffe Dobbelen Tripel IPA.I would avoid this place at night if you don’t like crowds. I went on sunny Saturday afternoon and it was nice and quiet.Manneken Pis’ sister statue is squatting in the alley, right across from Delirium Cafe.

My time in Brussels was cut short due to my anxiety about the possibility of a severely delayed train on my way back to Dusseldorf, so I never made it to this pub — but I think it still deserves a place on this list.They have an extensive selection (about 300) of traditional Lambic beers, as well as other Belgian brews and imports. I’m told they offer a tasty Charcuterie and Cheese Plate and it’s a popular spot for locals. Plan Your Trip to Brussels, BelgiumAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/best-canadian-destinations-solo-travelers,The Best Canadian Destinations for Solo Travelers,Canada,"Solo travel in Canada should be on everyone’s bucket list. Not only is the country safe, it’s easy to get around in, has diverse culture coast-to-coast, and has a lot to see and do for every type of traveler. Covering culture, nature and history, here are the best Canadian destinations for solo travelers! Canada is the second biggest country in the world, so picking a destination can be overwhelming. If you plan on traveling solo in Canada, here are the ten best places to start! Table of ContentsBest Canadian Destinations for Solo TravelersHalifax, Nova ScotiaVancouver Island, British ColumbiaToronto, OntarioMontreal, QuebecEastern NewfoundlandOttawa, OntarioWhitehorse, Yukon TerritoryBanff, AlbertaWinnipeg, ManitobaThe Sea to Sky Highway, British ColumbiaBest Canadian Destinations for Solo Travelers Halifax, Nova ScotiaA very walkable city, Halifax is the capital of Nova Scotia and is known for its maritime and Scottish history. While you’re there, take a walk along the colorful waterfront, visit the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, go on a brewery tour (try Alexander Keith’s for something iconic), and go shopping on Spring Garden Road.If you’re in need of a nature fix while you’re in Halifax, then I highly recommend heading out to Advocate Harbour and the Bay of Fundy for a day. Read more: The Perfect Road Trip Itinerary in Nova Scotia Vancouver Island, British ColumbiaWith gorgeous forests, pretty towns, and a laid-back island culture, Vancouver Island is a bohemian, natural oasis. While you can’t go wrong no matter where you head on the island, for something a little different, try the Northern part of the island.On North Vancouver Island, you’ll find Grizzly Bear tours, whale watching tours, amazing hiking trails, and some fun kayaking locations.

If you’re a culture lover, head over to quirky Kensington Market, visit the Art Gallery of Ontario, marvel at Casa Loma, or catch a concert at a local venue. If that’s not quite your speed, then Toronto also has tons to do in terms of fabulous restaurants, sports, shopping, and history.For an easy jaunt out of town, drive or hop on a guided tour of Niagara Falls and the wineries at Niagara on the Lake. Due to the falls being larger on the American side, the viewing is better when you’re in Niagara! Montreal, QuebecAn urban gem with sections reminiscent of a quaint European city, Montreal is the largest city in Canada’s French-speaking province of Quebec. That said, Montreal is almost entirely bilingual, so getting around is a piece of cake.While you’re in Montreal, I recommend hiking up Mount Royal, checking out the Notre-Dame Basilica, wandering through the streets of Old Montreal, spending some time in Parc Jean Drapeau, and eating Poutine! That’s right, Canada’s favorite dish comprised of fries, cheese curds, and gravy originates from Quebec. Just go slow. Eastern NewfoundlandA maritime region rich in history, culture, and seafood, Eastern Newfoundland is a great summertime destination for the nature lover. My advice is to first base yourself in St. John’s to hike signal hill and check out Quidi Vidi Harbor, and then take day trips to snorkel with Humpback whales in Petty Harbor, and see the puffins in Elliston.If you’re planning an outdoorsy trip to Newfoundland, I recommend going in the summertime for optimum weather. However, due to the sea regulation, even the summer temperatures here are quite mild. Be sure to pack appropriately! Read more: Eastern Newfoundland Travel Guide & Packing Tips Ottawa, OntarioLocated in Southeastern Ontario, Ottawa is Canada’s capital city and is absolutely brimming with Canadian culture. In Ottawa, check out Parliament Hill (it’s particularly pretty at sunset), go boating or ice skating on Rideau Canal, visit funky ByWard Market, visit the Canadian Museum of History, and shop in Westboro Village.If you have a little more time, I would recommend visiting both Montreal and Ottawa in one fell swoop. The cities are only a couple hours away from one another and are connected by bus, train, and plane. Whitehorse, Yukon TerritoryThe capital city of the Yukon Territory, Whitehorse is often overlooked as a solo travel destination due to its remote and sparse location, but what it lacks in population it makes up for in unbridled wilderness.Of course Whitehorse is known as an amazing place to view the Northern Lights, but it’s also home to the Miles Canyon Basalts, the MacBride Museum of Yukon History, the Takhini Hot Springs, and many wildlife preserves. What’s more is, you can hire a guide to take you on almost any of these adventures!

The historic town of Banff is full of authentic saloons, cool shops, great pubs, and a lot of scenic nature.To get that nature fix, head out to the Banff Upper Hot Springs, get a guide and go trekking in the Rockies, drive the Icefields Parkway from Banff to Jasper and, if you’re feeling particularly adventurous, check out Mt. Norquay’s Via Ferrata. Read more: The 12 Most Beautiful Places to Visit in Alberta, Canada Winnipeg, ManitobaWhile once often-overlooked, Winnipeg has been picking up tourism steam in recent years and for good reason. This funky city in the Canadian prairies is a hotspot of culture and is home to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, the ever-cool Exchange District, the quirky Osborne Village, The Forks National Historic Site, and tons of great shopping opportunities.If you’re looking for a bit of a nature escape from the city, I’d recommend renting a car and heading out to both the town of Gimli and Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park. The Sea to Sky Highway, British ColumbiaIf you’re someone who loves a good solo road trip, then this route is for you! Beginning in Vancouver (also a solo-friendly city) and running through to Whistler, the Highway is only a couple hours long but is jam packed with awesome scenery and things to do.On the route, be sure to check out Brandywine Falls, the Sea to Sky Gondola in Squamish, the Peak 2 Peak Gondola in Whistler, and hike every chance you get!

https://ordinarytraveler.com/banff-national-park-travel-guide,The Ultimate Adventure and Luxury Guide to Banff National Park,Canada,"Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada is both an adventure and a luxury dream destination. Not only does the park have incredible outdoor attractions such as mountains, lakes, and forests, it’s home to some very luxurious hotels with all the amenities.On my recent trip to Banff National Park as a part of the Seeker Project by Le Club AccorHotels, I had the opportunity to stay at two of these luxury properties, the Fairmont Banff Springs as well as the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise. Staying at these hotels not only put me in close proximity to all of the nearby attractions, it also provided me with amazing amenities and things to do right in the hotels themselves. The Ultimate Adventure and Luxury Guide to Banff National Park How to Get to Banff National ParkThe easiest and most time-efficient way to get to Banff National Park is to fly into Calgary International Airport and then rent a car. Renting a car will not only get you into the park, but it will allow you to explore everything the park has to offer on your own schedule.That said, if you’re not into renting a car, there’s a shuttle that regularly goes from the Calgary Airport to both the town of Banff and Lake Louise. The Best Time to Visit Banff National ParkThe best time to visit Banff completely depends on what you expect to get from your experience. Banff in winter is a total wonderland, with skiing, ice skating, ice climbing, and snowshoeing options.Summertime in Banff gets quite busy, but is an awesome time to visit for hiking, swimming, and canoeing.If you are looking for all the benefits of the area but with mild days and fewer crowds, then the shoulder season is the way to go. Just note that the lakes tend to freeze over early November, and there are seasonal closures that come with icy roads.

After a few decades in operation, the original hotel burned down and was replaced in 1928 with what we see today — an amazing, castle-like building with luxurious amenities.Due to my Le Club AccorHotels Membership (the points membership associated with the Fairmont), I stayed on the Gold Luxury Floor where the service was impeccable and the amenities were abundant. Each day I was treated to complimentary breakfast and snacks, the use of a pair of sneakers courtesy of the hotel’s partnership with Reebok, as well as yoga and fitness classes.In addition to those amenities, I treated myself to a relaxing afternoon at the hotel’s Willow Stream Spa, I had a fabulous, and filling Afternoon Tea in the Rundle Lounge (the views from that room are unreal), and I took advantage of their fully-equipped gym.  Fairmont Chateau Lake LouiseJust a 40 minute drive from Banff, the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise is a luxurious spot surrounded by mountains, a very turquoise Lake Louise, and the Victoria Glacier. The hotel itself is an oasis home to some great restaurants, an awesome wellness program, mountain adventure excursions, and comfortable, spacious suites.During my stay at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, I took advantage of their Suite Life program, in which a dedicated Concierge helped me with everything from making dining reservations, to booking activities and transportation.Additionally, the hotel’s Suite Life gave me access to a complimentary breakfast, valet parking, nightly turndown service, and even fresh cut flowers.Another element to staying in a Fairmont property is recognition of their dedication to waste management and sustainability. I was super impressed to hear that not only did they have scales in each of their restaurants to gauge food waste, they also were dedicated in scaling back water usage whenever possible. Le Club AccorHotelsLe Club AccorHotels is a membership program associated with these two Fairmont properties that will allow you to enjoy benefits at any participating AccorHotels location in the world. Not only does this mean you’ll earn points for each of your stays, you’ll receive benefits with their partners, have early-bird access to sales, and enjoy elite experiences. The Seeker ProjectThe Seeker Project, developed by Le Club AccorHotels, was born out of the belief that a key element to luxury is the anticipation of needs. The project immerses guests in an interactive sensory experience that measures behavioral and biometric responses to help determine what kind of experience that person is craving. As a result, it’s remarkably accurate!

If you’re looking to try something new for brunch, I definitely recommend hitting up their weekend buffet – it’s delicious!  Castello RistoranteA modern Italian restaurant located in a charming room of the Fairmont Banff Springs, Castello Ristorante has all the pasta, pizza, and even salad options you could want.  Alpine SocialA buzzing spot with many great comfort-food menu options, dining at Alpine Social in the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise will make you feel right at home. Take in the ambiance while you try out one of the many local craft beers they have on tap.  Lakeview LoungeA lounge with food options as incredible as the view, Lakeview Lounge in Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise is an iconic Canadian lounge with an elegant yet laid-back atmosphere. Definitely come here to nibble on some appetizers as you try one of their delicious cocktails.  Poppy BrasserieDuring your stay at Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, stopping in at Poppy Brasserie for brunch is an absolute must. They have a wide array of options, including a full omelette station. Things to do in Banff National Park  Visit the SpaBoth hotels have amazing spa services, complete with massage, facial, and treatment rooms. Plus, the Fairmont Banff Springs also has a mineral pool, and three waterfall treatment whirlpools.  Go on a Self-Guided Photo TourIn a place as beautiful as Banff National Park, there are many photo spots to be taken advantage of. Some of my favorites are the view from the Fairmont Banff Springs, Lake Minnewanka, the Fairview Lookout, Johnston Canyon, and Vermillion Lakes.  Hike Johnston CanyonTaking a hike through Johnston Canyon is a total must-do during a visit to Banff. This leisurely hike will take you through Lower Falls, Upper Falls, Horseshoe Bend, and up to the Ink Pots.  Go on a Mountain AdventureWhile staying at Lake Louise, be sure to hire a guide at the hotel to take you up on a mountain adventure. In my case, we hiked from the Chateau to Fairview Lookout and not only was our guide extremely personable and thoughtful, he was knowledgeable as well.  Explore Lake LouiseNo matter what time of year you visit, exploring Lake Louise will be a highlight of your trip. In the summer, rent a canoe and hit the water, or hike on one of the many trails in the area. In the winter, make sure the water is frozen over and then either take a walk on the lake or strap on a pair of ice skates.Also note that there are some gorgeous waterfalls on the far side of Lake Louise. The first will be near the back to the right as you walk away from the Fairmont Lake Louise, and the second at the very back of the lake once the main path ends and a horse trail begins.  Take a Gondola RideDid you know that both Banff and Lake Louise have their own Gondolas? It’s true, and both offer amazing views (and photography opportunities) of the landscape.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/best-photo-locations-banff-national-park-canada,The Best Photography Spots in Banff National Park,Canada,"Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada is an extremely photogenic destination. Not only is the park full of iconic mountains, it’s home to turquoise lakes, rushing rivers, lush forests, charming towns, and picturesque hotels.I recently took the Seeker Project quiz by Le Club AccorHotels, and my results showed that I was craving an outdoor adventure. This revolutionary quiz uses biometric responses to formulate the dream travel destination for a user based on their responses to a series of images. Well, those results were spot on, and Banff, with its beautiful yet wild scenery and outdoor opportunities, was the perfect place for me to go to get my nature fix.As this was my third visit to this part of Canada, I’ve come up with the best photo locations in Banff National Park. See below for these 10 iconic spots you won’t want to miss! The Best Photo Locations in Banff National Park Lake LouiseA turquoise dream in the summer and a snowy wonderland come winter, Lake Louise is a glacier-fed oasis surrounded by ethereal mountains. In order to get the full Lake Louise experience and the best photography opportunities, I stayed at the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise. This allowed me to stay right in the center of all the attractions.Some of my favorite photo opportunities in Lake Louise include the giant main-floor windows at the chateau overlooking the lake, the waterfalls at the back of the lake (which can be accessed by either taking the trail around the right side of the lake, or by canoe), and Fairview Lookout that overlooks both the lake and the Chateau. Johnston CanyonThe trail leading to Johnston Canyon is an awe-inspiring one; it winds from the parking lot, through the canyon, and up to the falls and inkpots. While this route is beautiful and mostly accessible any time of year, I recommend doing the hike in either the shoulder seasons or the winter, due to the sometimes-intense summertime crowds.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					There will be no shortage of photo opportunities once you get to Johnston, but some of my favorite spots are the Upper Falls, the Lower Falls, and Horseshoe Bend (just make sure to look ahead to see if the access to Horseshoe Bend is open as it closes seasonally). Read more: The Best Photo Locations in Alberta, Canada Vermillion LakesThe Vermilion Lakes are a trio of lakes just minutes from the town of Banff, and they offer awesome shots of Mount Rundle. There are many photography vantage points located on the side of the lake by the road, most of which will give a great shot of the mountain reflected on the water.That said, if you’re looking to get the absolute best shots of the Vermillion Lakes and Mount Rundle, I’d recommend staying at the Fairmont Banff Springs. The hotel is just a 10 minute drive away which means you’re super close for those sunrise and sunset shots! Moraine LakeJust a ten-minute drive from Lake Louise, Moraine Lake is a brilliant turquoise colored lake that’s located in Valley Of The Ten Peaks. The mountains jutting up all around the lake make for the most unreal views and incredible photography opportunities. My recommendation is to grab a canoe and head out on the lake.Note that because of safety concerns, the road to Moraine Lake isn’t open in the winter. Make sure to check opening and closing dates before you go! Peyto Lake ViewpointThe Peyto Lake panoramic viewpoint is accessible via a 2.7 kilometer hiking loop situated about a 30-minute drive from Lake Louise. From the viewpoint, you’ll see the turquoise colored Peyto Lake surrounded by forests and mountains. The hike is short and easy, and the panorama you’ll get at the top will be worth it.The trail does tend to get a little busy in peak season, so be sure to get there early or stay late. Alternatively, if you get to the viewpoint and find it’s just a little too busy for your liking, continue on the trail up the hill; there is a second, less crowded viewpoint just up the road that will give you an unobstructed view. Read more: The 12 Most Beautiful Places to Visit in Alberta, Canada Signature MountainIf you stand out on one of the terraces at the Fairmont Banff Springs and look out at the scene in front of you, Signature Mountain will be the crown jewel of what you’re looking at. The mountain can be photographed from the water or from one of the many vantage points nearby, but the best spot in my opinion, is from the Fairmont Banff. Downtown BanffThe town of Banff has an incredibly charming downtown area; full of chalet-style buildings, pretty lights, and mom and pop businesses. So naturally this area is very photogenic as well.That said, there’s always that one shot that takes the scene to another level, and that’s the shot of the town with Cascade Mountain in the background. To grab this iconic photo of downtown Banff, head to Banff Avenue, look towards the mountain, and shoot. Lake MinnewankaAbout 5 kilometres from the town of Banff lays Lake Minnewanka, a large, glacial-fed lake surrounded by mountains. In addition to being very photogenic, this is also a popular hiking and fishing spot.The lake is also known for being an awesome Northern Light viewing location, so arrive late, set your camera to a long-exposure, and get snapping. Read more:  The Best Cameras for Hiking and Backpacking Two Jack LakeJust like Vermillion Lakes, heading out to Two Jack Lake will give you awesome views of Mount Rundle, albeit from a new perspective. The lake is situated on the Lake Minnewanka loop road, and has some great hiking, fishing, and even scuba diving. Morant’s CurveOne of the most iconic photography spots in all of Canada, Morant’s Curve is located just outside Lake Louise on the Bow Valley Parkway. The railway bend has a breathtaking forest and mountain backdrop, and was first photographed into history when the Canadian Pacific Railway completed their tracks through this area, and then sent their photographer, Nicholas Morant, to snap some photos.To get that iconic shot, head to the viewpoint on the Bow Valley Parkway and, if you’re patient, wait for a train to come rolling by. Read More:Eastern Newfoundland Travel Guide + Packing TipsThe Perfect Road Trip Itinerary in Nova ScotiaWhat to Pack for a Winter Trip to CanadaTravel Guide to British Columbia’s Sea to Sky HwyRoad Trip Essentials: What to Pack on a Road Trip20 Best Travel Hacks That Will Save You Money My trip to Banff was part of a travel campaign with Travel Mindset and Le Club Accor Hotels.

While the falls are photo-worthy in their own right, they’re even more spectacular set against the Mount Kerkeslin backdrop.Note however that the mist from the falls tends to create a slippery environment. Remember to stay on the paved trails! Johnston CanyonNestled in Banff National Park, Johnston Canyon is home to waterfalls, a forest, a creek, and canyon walls that stretch up into the sky. While we recommend visiting the canyon in the wintertime for the most dramatic icy landscapes (and the ice walk tour), this destination is a great photography spot all year round. Icefields ParkwayJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Stretching through Banff and Jasper National Parks, The Icefields Parkway (also known as Highway 93 N) is rated as one of the most beautiful drives on the planet.

Read more: The Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel Photographers Lake LouiseJust an hour east of Banff you’ll find Lake Louise, a gorgeously blue-hued lake surrounded by dramatic picturesque mountains that seemingly hold up Victoria Glacier. Note that because Lake Louise can get rather crowded in the summertime, the best shots tend to be either from the water or off one of the hiking trails. Maligne CanyonSitting at the entrance to Maligne Valley in Jasper National Park, Maligne Canyon is the deepest canyon in the park, and is known for its chilling atmosphere. While the canyon is staggeringly beautiful any time of year, in the winter the crashing waterfalls freeze over offering some up-close, icy photography opportunities.To help explore this canyon and get some unreal shots, there are six bridges stretching across various points. Maligne LakeA pristine crystal-clear lake surrounded by glaciers and about an hour’s drive from Maligne Canyon, Maligne Lake is the second-largest glacier lake in the world. The azure-blue lake is characterized by Spirit Island, which lies in the middle. For the best shots and the most efficient way to see Maligne Lake, we recommend renting a kayak and hitting the water. Read more: 5 Common Travel Photography Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them) Moraine LakeLocated in Banff National Park and just 14km from Lake Louise, Lake Moraine is a glacially fed lake surrounded by mountains and waterfalls. While this is a spectacular spot all year, it is even more spectacular for photos in June when the glaciers melt and turn the lake an even more turquoise blue. Two Jack LakeA favourite spot among photographers due to its pink and purple sunsets, Two Jack Lake is a peaceful spot just north of Banff. The mountains and trees reflected in the still waters of Two Jack will give you swoon-worthy shots. Lake MinnewankaA glacial man-made lake in eastern Banff National Park, lake Minnewanka is known for its blue waters and, in the wintertime, Northern Lights. That’s right, when the conditions are right, Lake Minnewanka is one of the best locations in Alberta for some Aurora Borealis viewing, which makes for awesome photography! Town of BanffWhile adventuring through Banff National Park, a stop in at the charming town of Banff proper will offer you plenty of fantastic landscape views as well as a great dose of local culture. For awesome photography spots in Banff, be sure to ride the gondola for landscape views and wander around town for a feel of the mountain-town charm.

Halifax’s restaurants and boutique stores have a ton of charm, and there’s not a shortage of places to stop for drinks either.Do a distillery tour and tasting at Halifax Distilling Co., taste Canadian fare-favorites on a food tour, learn about the city’s long and unique history on a city tour (the Harbour Hopper goes in and out of the water!), and pick up a sweet treat from the harbour-front Farmers Market.

Here you’ll find galleries and plenty of eye-catching art scattered around town, with way too many Instagram-worthy photo opportunities to count.If you stay overnight, I’d recommend the Gillespie House Inn for an amazingly warm staff and hospitable stay! The owners even run the best restaurant in town — BlackRock Bistro — which should definitely be your go-to for lunch and/or dinner. Where to sleep: Gillespie House Inn Stop #3: Advocate Harbour/Bay of FundyBay of Fundy is one of Nova Scotia’s top draws, and for good reason: the tower cliffs and seaside views are unparalleled. Head to Cape Chignecto Provincial Park and check in at the visitor center before heading of to any of the number of stunning hiking trails.You can actually camp here without a campsite reservation, which you may want to take advantage of for a bit of solitude. Tides rise up 45 feet year-round, so you definitely won’t want to miss this! While you’re there, take a kayaking tour to see the Three Sisters sea stacks up close.Cape d’Or lighthouse is little tricky to get to (you must hike down a steep trail to reach it), but the scenery is well worth it. You can even stay the night in Lighthouse Keeper’s guesthouse! Regardless of whether you stay the night, absolutely check out this iconic lighthouse and stay for a meal. Where to sleep: Gillespie House Inn or Cape d’Or Lighthouse Stop #4: TatamagoucheTatamagouche’s Train Station Inn is worthy of a stop itself, but locals can attest that this small town has recently blossomed into its own tourist destination. On the main street downtown you’ll find a modern brewery worth a couple of hours of your time (get a flight and try 5 of their best drafts), and buggy rides that are a hit with visitors of any age. Where to sleep: The Train Station Inn Stop #5: PictouThe Pictou Lodge is the most well-known accommodation in the area, and it definitely lives up to its hype! Beach, bonfires, canoeing, paddleboarding, fine dining restaurant with ocean views — it literally has it all. This is the perfect stop to stay a night or two and take in some of the best unobstructed sunset views on the coast. Where to sleep: Pictou Lodge Beach Resort Stop #6: Annapolis ValleyYou wouldn’t think Canada to be a place for vineyards to thrive, yet their exclusive classification of crisp “Tidal Bay” white wines are heavenly! Annapolis Valley is known as the wine region of Nova Scotia, and the drive to it from Halifax provides PLENTY of opportunities to stop and taste different wines known nationwide. Here are just a few spots with traditional tasting in a beautiful vineyard setting.Beavercreek Winery & CafePlanters Ridge WineryBlomidon Estate WineryGaspereau VineyardsLightfoot & Wolfville Vineyards Where to sleep: Wolfville Luxury Bed & Breakfast Stop #7: LunenburgKnown as “Canada’s Most Colorful Town,” Lunenburg is famous for its bright buildings, harbor-side downtown area, and amazing panorama of sailboats. The hotels and inns downtown are the best place to stay, not just for the central location but also for the unbeatable view!The architecture and houses here date back hundreds of years, making this one of the most unique spots on the trip.A walking tour is the best way to see it all, but if you don’t have the time, make sure to see the storybook-like St. John’s Church, and get a postcard-worthy view of the town from golf course across the harbor! If at this point in your trip you haven’t tried a fresh lobster roll, poutine or oysters, Lunenburg offers plenty of great quality restaurants with local seafood year-round. Where to sleep: Lunenburg Arms Hotel Last Tip: Go Off the Beaten Path!Some of my most memorable views and coolest experiences happened when I strayed from my itinerary, ventured off the beaten path (literally), pulled the car over when something caught my eye or explored something unexpected I stumbled across on my travels.

Read more: Women’s Packing Guide For Switzerland Things to Do in Kandersteg & Lake Oeschinensee  Visit Lake OeschinenseeLake Oeschinensee is a turquoise dream surrounded by the towering Swiss Alps. Because the lake is fed by glacier waters, it’s a little chilly but definitely swimmable come summer time. If that’s not your thing, then there are guided paddle tours available from Kandersteg.If you plan on visiting from December through May, know that the lake will probably be frozen over, but in the deeper winter months it’s great for cross-country skiing.  Visit BlauseeWith a name that literally translates to “blue”, Lake Blausee is just a fifteen minute drive from Kandersteg and is surrounded by dense forest. The whole area is a park in which you can have a picnic, head out on the lake on a glass-bottom boat, or visit the museum. Also, the lake itself is an organic trout farm that has a fishing event every October.To get to Lake Blausee, you can catch the bus from Kandersteg or drive. However, if you plan on driving I highly recommend getting there early in the day as the parking lots tend to fill up fast, especially on the weekends.  Tropical House FrutigenHome to an integrated fish farm, a tropical garden, an interactive exhibition, and a unique energy concept, a visit to Tropical House Frutigen will be unlike anything else you’ve experienced in the Swiss Alps.While you’re here, stop in at the Tropengarten restaurant for a quick bite.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/womens-packing-guide-switzerland,Women’s Packing Guide For Switzerland,Switzerland,"Known for its pristine cities, gorgeous Alps and rich, diverse culture, Switzerland embodies the best of Europe! Have your ticket booked, but don’t know where to begin with packing? Check out a few of our tips to best prepare for the Swiss trip of your dreams! Switzerland Packing Guide for Women  Conservative AttireWhile clothing doesn’t necessarily need to be conservative in the conventional sense, your travel wardrobe should be tasteful and presentable. The notion of jeans being frowned upon in Switzerland might be a little bit outdated, but by no means should you bring anything even closely resembling a “distressed” look!Generally speaking, Americans’ “nice” clothing is likely normal, everyday attire for the Swiss — and that goes for both men and women. Jeans can be appropriate if they are dark or black, and it hardly ever reaches temperatures warm enough to necessitate shorts.While muted colors may be the norm, don’t feel confined to wearing black. Just try to steer clear of anything too gaudy! An evening out is an appropriate time to dress a little nicer — swap the daytime dark denim for a nice dress or maxi skirt, and pair with a comfortable pair of sandals or loafers.Spring and autumn are almost entirely unpredictable; anyone will tell you that layers are a must, which shouldn’t be hard with rather neutral packing. Aside from your basic layering essentials, be sure to also pack gloves, a warm scarf, and comfortable walking shoes (or comfortable boots) appropriate for any weather (i.e. rain)!  Portable Power BankSwitzerland was meant for long days exploring, which also means a dead phone battery three hours after leaving your accommodation. If you have the space in your backpack, carry a charged portable power bank to keep your GPS and music source alive all day! Download new playlists, audiobooks and podcasts beforehand, and do not forget your headphones.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					  Hiking GearFor most, the draw of Switzerland lies in the towering Alps and all of the ways to explore them! Skiing in summer, kayaking, hang gliding, and river rafting only scratch the surface of the fun possibilities. Regardless of your itinerary, you’ll most definitely want to prepare for a few good hikes!Leave the heavy-duty outdoor equipment at home — there are plenty of places to rent any gear you need, so don’t lug around bulky skis or waste luggage space with your insulated ski-wear. I would, however, make sure you bring some basics — comfortable hiking shoes, multiple pairs of thick socks, and a rain-resistant jacket — for hiking. A collapsable, reusable water bottle can also be filled with high-quality Swiss water at water fountains, natural spring water drinking fountains, and anywhere you can find a tap.  Small First Aid KitTo accompany your hiking attire, you’ll also want to keep a minimal first aid kit in your bag when you venture out beyond city streets. Outdoor activity, no matter how vigorous, means you runs the risk of a few cuts and scrapes — so don’t get caught mountainside without a few basics to keep you covered.A compact kit that can fit in the palm of your hand is small enough that it shouldn’t be inconvenient to carry, but you’ll very thankful you did!  SunscreenSunscreen is expensive — like $20 USD expensive!! — so this is one commodity you won’t want to forget at home. Make sure the sunscreen you bring has a high SPF and is easy to apply (think the clear spray kind) so you can re-apply throughout the day; bright sun, especially reflecting off snow, can result in serious burns if not prevented by protection! This may be redundant, but sunglasses are also a necessity. Additional Packing Tips for Switzerland Download helpful appsBefore your arrival, I’d highly recommend downloading a few apps that will help make your travel within Switzerland much smoother. Language apps — a convenient alternative to full-size phrase books — will serve you well when confronted with German, French and Italian (depending on the region), though it’s much appreciated by the locals if you learn a few common phrases beforehand. Don’t have the time? Google Translate has saved me multiple times.You may also find the app for SBB, Switzerland’s public transportation, useful as well. You can purchase a Swiss travel pass which will allow you access to all rail, road and waterway transport for a designated amount of days, should you choose to forego the awesome opportunity of renting bikes! Buy travel insuranceAside from obligatory plug adapter and voltage converter, don’t forget to buy travel insurance! If you’re headed to the Alps, you’re undoubtedly going to engage in an adventurous activity or two. If you’re partaking in winter sports like skiing and snow trekking, this may cost more than your standard -run-of-the-mill travel insurance, but that doesn’t mean you should go without. We use and trust World Nomads for our travel insurance needs. Currency exchangeThe Swiss franc is the national currency, but exchanging dollars for them — especially at the airport — will seriously gouge you. Whatever fee your bank charges for withdrawing money internationally (from an ATM) is going to be much less than bringing cash and exchanging it.Switzerland is notoriously expensive, so no need to add more unnecessary expenses to the bill! Only take out as much as you need; since Visas are accepted nearly everywhere, and with minimal foreign transaction fees, using a credit card is going to be your best option. Read More:How to Travel Switzerland on a Budget10 Bucket List Adventures To Take In 20185 Must-Do European Road Trips10 Experiences You Can’t Miss in Zermatt, SwitzerlandTravel Guide to Geneva, SwitzerlandHow to Travel Expensive Countries Affordably"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/switzerland-budget-travel-tips,How to Travel Switzerland on a Budget,Switzerland,"Switzerland, a country revered for everything from magnificent snow peaks to tantalizing chocolatiers and much else in between, hasn’t always exactly been synonymous with the idea of a “budget trip”. Between ticket prices for some of the most beautiful rail routes in the world and the cost of staying in bustling metropolitan hubs — a poorly planned vacation to Switzerland can leave your travel budget with more holes in it than a wheel of Swiss cheese!If Switzerland is on your bucket list (it was at the top of mine for many years!), believe it or not, it can be a lot less pricey than you think. With a little planning, you can experience all that this famous European destination has to offer without breaking the bank.Follow these simple money-saving tips when planning your trip and you’ll see how it really is possible to travel Switzerland on a budget! Switzerland Budget Travel Tips Research is Your FriendKnow where you want to go. It may sound like an obvious tip, but the kindest thing you can do for your budget is plan which cities you want to visit and then figure out the best way to get from one location to another. Some offer free public transport, others have cheap international flights – so decide which parts of Switzerland you want to visit first and structure your cost-effective itinerary second. Budget Transportation in SwitzerlandThe usual frustrating volatility of international flight prices can actually work in your favor when looking for a cheap deal to Switzerland. Planning your trip for low-season (February to May) will guarantee cheaper flights. Also, when planning your international flight, don’t be afraid to fly into one city and out of another.A beautiful train journey between two cities and the opportunity to explore both could be the most economical option. With budget airlines like EasyJet and RyanAir, it could even be cheaper to stopover in another European hub on your way in or out of Switzerland.

Travel passes can be a budget-friendly way to avoid budget-unfriendly ticket prices — just make sure its worth your while before you buy.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					If you’re visiting only one or two regions, with a minimal need for train travel, then grab a Supersaver or Half Fare Card. If you’re going to be on the rails every other day, then look into buying a Swiss Travel Pass, Eurail or Interrail Pass.Remember, booking online is almost always cheaper than buying tickets at the kiosk and it goes without saying that the more in advance you book, the better deals you’ll find — so be sure to set aside time for this early on!It’s worth noting that some passes include a ton of freebies like discounted ferry and cable car rides, sightseeing experiences and more which gives you even more reason to research ahead of time. Free Public Transportation in SwitzerlandThe wonderfully pragmatic Swiss actually offer free public transport in some of their most well-travelled cities including Bern, Basel, Geneva, Lucerne and Lausanne. To save a veritable fortune on expensive taxi fares and still have the freedom to explore a whole city, just pick up your free transport card when you check into your accommodation.It’s worth noting that Bern, Geneva, Zurich and Neuchâtel offer free bikes too — another great way to save some money on transportation! Budget Accomodation in SwitzerlandWhile the idea of relaxing by a roaring fireplace in a luxury pinewood cabin high in the Swiss Alps, may be appealing – it’ll be a serious drain on your budget and you can definitely experience all Switzerland has to offer without having a potentially overpriced roof over your head.Airbnb is a great way to save money on accommodation in big cities as well as in the country. It also gives you the opportunity to meet locals and have a more authentic experience. I’ve also had good luck finding affordable hotels on Booking.com throughout Switzerland. One of my favorite places in the Jungfrau region was this hotel in the fairytale-like town of Lauterbrunnen which was surprisingly inexpensive!If you’re keeping things metropolitan, then look to stay somewhere central to save time and money on getting around. Kitchen facilities are a blessing when it comes traveling on a budget, so be sure to pick up something affordable and local, like the delicious rösti, to save some francs on dining out.For a truly picturesque experience, forget mountain views from a hotel window – stay in one of the many modestly priced campsites situated in and around the gorgeous valleys of the Swiss countryside. All include basic facilities and many provide cabins and mobile homes if you don’t want to sleep in a tent. With prices as low as 25 – 35CHF per person, you can wake up amongst mountains and meadows with stunning vistas for a fraction of the cost of staying in a hotel. Geneva and Zermatt are two beautiful, popular outdoor destinations with a range of affordable camping options. Stray From the Beaten PathSwitzerland is home to world renowned hikes for all endurance levels, so skip the pricey tours and connect with nature for free. With lakes and waterfalls in abundance (the Rhine Falls near Schaffhausen is a must see!), there’s no better way to immerse yourself in real, Alpine beauty.Getting to know some locals is also a sure-fire way to get great recommendations on local entertainment or restaurants. Instead of heading to a tourist office, chat with locals in a cafe or bar to uncover some budget-friendly local secrets. FreebiesAdmission to a majority of the museums, churches and historical centres in Switzerland is completely free. Towns like Interlaken, Bern and Montreux are charming enough to wander around for hours without getting bored.Looking for some cheap eats? How about free? Farmers markets in Switzerland are renowned for offering unlimited, delicious free samples, so consider foregoing lunch one day and stocking up on mouth-watering local produce instead. ExcursionsThough the mainstream tours and outings around Switzerland have a tendency to be pricey, you can most definitely avoid overpaying. If you’re by yourself, then try to book off-season, well in advance and refer to any benefits and discounts included on your travel passes. If you’re traveling with companions, then check out the Swiss Coupon Pass. At only 49 CHF, you only need to use a few coupons to start saving.Spending a few days in Switzerland is undeniably likely to leave your finances looking a little lighter. That’s okay. All the world-famous chocolate, fondue and excursions are too irresistible to not try at least once, so you shouldn’t deny yourself the pleasure of indulging responsibly. These tips, however, will help with saving money where it can be saved, at no cost to experiencing everything about Switzerland that makes it such a beautiful and popular destination. Read More:10 Experiences You Can’t Miss in Zermatt, SwitzerlandTravel Guide to Geneva, SwitzerlandHow to Travel Expensive Countries AffordablyHow to Travel Norway on a BudgetHow to Choose the Best Travel CameraPin it!"

https://ordinarytraveler.com/easiest-way-visit-cuba-americans,How to Travel to Cuba as an American in 2020,Cuba,"For decades, Cuba has been many of American’s most coveted destination — the beautiful time-capsule country has always been so far out reach, visiting only seemed possible in a dream. However, with regulations recently changing we’ve found it’s not only possible to visit Cuba, but it’s actually easy and affordable!With Holland America, Americans — and travelers from all over the world! — now have the opportunity to explore this island stopped in time effortlessly. How to Travel to Cuba as an American in 2020 How to Visit Cuba as an AmericanWhen I learned of Holland America’s Cuba cruise I was immediately excited; the thought of going through the visa approval process always seemed daunting, but the process of obtaining the visa through the cruise line was shockingly simple and straightforward. I didn’t have to arrange my own paperwork, and allowing Holland America to take care of it all ensures everything is done right.There was also the question of how I would qualify for a tourist visa — after all, the options for Americans are limited. Thankfully, the cruise’s organized day tours qualify for the United States’ “People-to-People” visa requirement. In short, attempting to legally (and correctly) complete this process on my own would have likely been a headache had Holland America not taken it off my hands. Approved Tours in Cuba for AmericansBecause the cruise departs from Florida’s Ft. Lauderdale port, U.S. citizens and foreign travelers alike abide by the same U.S. regulations — this includes a 6 hour (minimum) “People-to-People” experience. Fortunately, the cruise’s tour options all fulfill this requirement and are so colorful and immersive anyone would want to do them anyway!Just after we pulled into Havana, we embarked on our American Classic Car tour by way of an awesome blue Chevy Deluxe. The tour itself was an all-in-one package full of history, dancing, and plenty of photo ops! Of course you’ll want to explore on your own for a bit, which you can do plenty of by taxi or walking around the Old Town area just steps from the port. You’re allowed to bring back cigars and one bottle of rum, so be sure to do your shopping here!Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The following day the ship docks in Cienfuegos, where you can visit the botanical gardens, enjoy dance lessons, or take a day trip out to the colorful city of Trinidad as we did! The guided tour was highly informational, though it was talking to the overly friendly locals that really brought this cobblestone old town to life.The cruise also makes a final stop at Georgetown, Grand Cayman — the seaside city known for its plentiful stingrays! Coast through stunning turquoise waters until you reach the sandbars called home to more stingrays than I could ever count. You can swim with them, hold them and even give them kisses. Travel to Cuba on Board Holland America’s VeendamEven at sea, you’ll get a taste of Cuban culture before you even step foot on land; listen in on informative talks for every port, which cover everything from what to expect of your destinations to Cuban slang lessons to nightly story-times that tell of Cuban tales and history. Not only are Cuban-inspired dishes expertly executed and served daily, but there are also near-daily cooking demonstrations that demonstrate how to cook the chef’s Cuban cuisine yourself.Choosing a cruise to Cuba means you won’t have to lug your suitcase around and you’ll only have to unpack once — even though you’ll get to experience two different cities in Cuba! With 7-day Cuban cruises starting at just $759, it’s easily one of the most affordable ways to visit this gorgeous country.It’s also worth noting that the crew onboard is exceptionally warm and happy; it is very obvious the staff is like family, and treats the guests as such too. Future Planning for Cuba on Holland AmericaHolland America’s Veendam ship will sail to Cuba this Fall of 2018, as well as Fall of 2019. Next January and March of 2019, the Veendam will also sail multi-national expeditions — both to include Cienfuegos as a stop. If I had one piece of advice at the end of all of this, it would be to take advantage of this opportunity now as there’s no way of knowing if or when US regulations will change! Read More:How to Pack for a Sailing TripTop Honeymoon Destinations for Couples on a BudgetTop 10 Things to Do in ArubaNevis Travel Guide & Packing TipsStaying at Ocean Club Resort in Turks & Caicos7 Experiences Every Traveler Should Have in St. Lucia "

https://ordinarytraveler.com/dusseldorf-karneval-germany,Feeling the Love at Dusseldorf’s Karneval,Germany,"“Helauuuuuu!”“Helauuuuuu!”This word continues to play over and over in my head, even after I’ve returned home from Germany. I heard it hundreds of times over the course of the three days I spent celebrating Karneval in Dusseldorf.What does it mean, you ask?Helau is the local word for the Karneval greeting in Dusseldorf — each city who celebrates Karneval has their own word — and it basically means hallelujah. Feeling the Love at Dusseldorf’s Karneval What is Karneval?Karneval (or Carnival) is like the Mardi Gras of Europe and one of the best parties in Germany. This tradition dates back to Medieval times and is celebrated between February and March (the dates vary from year to year). Karneval officially begins on November 11th at 11:11am, but the crazy parties don’t really begin until Altweiberfastnacht, sometime between mid-February and mid-March.In the early days, Karneval celebrations symbolized the driving out of winter and its evil spirits, so people wore masks to scare away these spirits. At Karneval-Time, the common folk had the chance to spoof the royals. Even today, it’s a time when people can mock the government without being punished. What to Expect at KarnevalJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Altweiberfastnacht (AKA the Women’s Day) on the Thursday before Ash WednesdayUnfortunately, I missed Thursday’s celebrations — when the ladies take over the City Hall and cut off men’s ties. There are parties in the streets, especially in Dusseldorf’s Old Town. Jugendumzug (Youth Procession) on SaturdayI did get a glimpse of Saturday’s festivities, still bleary-eyed from my overnight flight. I warmed up with an afternoon shot of Killepitsch, while the children marched through Old Town. Karneval Sunday in KonigsalleeBefore noon on Sunday, people were already drinking and partying in the streets of Konigsallee. The locals get creative with ways to carry around their alcohol. You will find baby strollers with numerous cup holders, makeshift bars in the streets and hidden pockets in colorful costumes. Rosenmontagszug (Rose Monday Parade)Monday’s festivities include a giant parade with decorated floats and people marching on foot through the city center. This year there were over one million people cheering in the crowd.This trip was hosted by Air Berlin and Visit Dusseldorf, so I had the unique opportunity of experiencing Rose Monday’s parade as a guest on Visit Dusseldorf’s float. I wasn’t sure what to expect from this experience. I normally don’t like being in front of a crowd, but it’s not like I had to give a speech or anything.Group Photo Before the Parade It was slightly grueling at first — a couple of hours of waiting in the cold and drizzle — but once our float approached the massive crowd, I could instantly feel their cheerful energy and soon forgot about the chilly weather.We threw candy into the crowd, while they shouted, “Helau” and waved their hands. The actual parade lasted about three hours and I couldn’t believe the stamina of some of the people in the crowd. Looking out at smiling children and animated adults made this an experience I will never forget.On Our Float! (Photo by Amateur Traveler) How To Get To Dusseldorf, GermanyDusseldorf can be reached via direct flight from New York, Chicago and Miami in the US and several cities in Europe. See Air Berlin’s routes if you are thinking about joining the Karneval festivities next year. The Breidenbacher Hof Hotel is located right in the middle of all the action, with easy access to Old Town, Konigsallee and the city center. Did you know Germany celebrated Karneval? Read More:5 Reasons Why You Should Visit Dusseldorf, Germany5 Fairytale Destinations to Visit in EuropeBest Carry-on Luggage of 2018 (For Every Type of Traveler)Essential Guide To Train Travel In EuropeThe Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel Photographers10 European Cities For Solo Female Travelers "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/dusseldorf-city-novice-travelers,"5 Reasons Why You Should Visit Dusseldorf, Germany",Germany,"Dusseldorf was my first introduction to Germany and I couldn’t have picked a better city to get a taste of German culture. I did pass through Germany on a European tour in my twenties, but I’ve always had slightly negative feelings about the country after being robbed while sleeping on the train.I know I can’t judge an entire country based on one incident — and on a train nonetheless — so when Air Berlin invited me to experience Karneval in Dusseldorf (the Mardi Gras of Europe) it sounded like too much fun to pass up.I decided to visit Dusseldorf, Germany during one of the busiest times of the year and yet I never once felt overwhelmed. I was with a group for part of my visit, but I did have plenty of time to explore the city without a guide. In fact, I barely pay attention to directions, train stops and street names when I’m on a tour, so I figured I’d be constantly lost during my free time in Dusseldorf — which surprisingly wasn’t the case. 5 Reasons Why You Should Visit Dusseldorf, Germany Public Transportation is User FriendlyComing from someone who rarely has an opportunity to navigate public transportation at home, I found the buses and trains in Dusseldorf to be very user friendly. When I wasn’t sure which bus to take, I just asked a lot of questions and usually found the drivers to be helpful.I highly recommend purchasing a Dusseldorf Transportation Card for 24, 48 or 72 hours, which gives you unlimited rides on the subway, bus or the tram (in addition to free or discounted admission to museums) for as low as 9 Euro.The Dussel River English is Widely SpokenLet’s face it: if you are an American, then there is a good chance you don’t speak German. I did my best to learn a few key words and phrases, but for the most part, I spoke English and always received a reply in my native tongue. International CuisineFinicky eaters won’t have a problem finding a place to eat here. Once you have had your fill of local dishes, you will have your choice of International restaurants with cuisine from countries like Argentina, Spain, Thailand, Ireland, Italy and Vietnam. Due to its large Japanese community, Dusseldorf also has the best Japanese food outside of Japan!Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Dusseldorf Media Harbour The City of Short DistancesDusseldorf is known as the city of short distances, so it’s not even necessary to take public transportation to explore most of the city, especially if you are staying in a hotel in or near Altstadt. I stayed at the Breidenbacher Hof and it was conveniently located near all of the main attractions in the city. Distance Between Other European CitiesAir Berlin flies direct to Dusseldorf from Chicago, New York, Miami, and in mid-April they will bring back their direct route from Los Angeles. Dusseldorf is also a great starting point to visit other European cities — many of which can be reached within one hour by plane. Read More:15 Best Weekend Getaways in EuropePacking Light: How To Pack For Carry-On Only10 Things You Should Know Before Traveling to EuropeThe Best Places to Visit in IcelandThe Ultimate Road Trip Packing GuideTop 12 Vegan-Friendly Travel Destinations To learn more about this German city, watch TravelDudes guide to Dusseldorf video. A big thanks to Air Berlin, Visit Dusseldorf and the Breidenbacher Hof for hosting my stay in Dusseldorf.

The river is where I truly feel at home. Conques, France: A Journey to the Middle Ages After hearing so much about the beauty of Conques, I felt my anticipation growing. Was the village covered in this lush greenery too?As the GPS directed, I turned left off the small highway and began climbing up a steep hill. I left the river behind, but noticed just as many trees, leading the way to Conques.Once you reach the parking lot, you can either walk from there or continue to the other side of the village — to a larger parking lot. Either way, it’s just a short five-minute walk to the heart of Conques.The history of Conques began in the eighth-century, when a holy man by the name of Dado abandoned his material things and settled here in the wilderness. He was later joined by a few companions and a small monastic community was formed.The Abbey Church of St Foy — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — still stands today, with much of the construction originating from the eleventh-century. I arrived to this small village late in the day, so I wasn’t able to explore every inch of it like I had hoped.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/marcilhac-sur-cele-france-des-touristes,"An Afternoon in Marcilhac sur Cele, France",France," After my visit to Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, I was pretty sure I had found the most beautiful village in France… but like any inquisitive traveler, I still had more exploring to do before I made my final decision.The next morning, I headed east to a restaurant in Marcilhac sur Cele on country roads that put the windy mountain roads back home in Northern California to shame. To say they were tiny would be an understatement. At times, I wasn’t sure if I was headed remotely in the right direction. I was told it would take an hour and a half, but after two hours passed, there was still no town to be seen.  “This is rural France,” I reminded myself. My only concern was running out of gas before I could find some form of civilization besides the occasional farm house or sheep field.A little over two hours into the drive, the GPS spoke. “You have reached your destination.”Okay, great. There is not a building in sight. As I tried to push away anxious thoughts, I realized the logical thing to do is continue driving in the same direction and hope the GPS gets back on track.Another ten minutes passed before I finally reached a tiny town — literally in the middle of nowhere. I looked for the name of the restaurant, “Les Touristes,” and noticed a sign with the words, “Des Touristes.” Close enough!  Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The restaurant looked closed, so I approached the only open door I could find — the kitchen. The cooks didn’t speak English, but pointed in the direction of another door, through the kitchen.What followed next was one of those unique travel experiences which you won’t find in a guidebook.I sat down at a table in the corner and was relieved to see several other hungry patrons, chatting and enjoying their meals. An animated young woman greeted me and confirmed I had found the correct place. She told me her parents owned the restaurant and they have been serving fresh, home-cooked meals for decades.She began bringing dishes brimming with food to the table, leaving them for me to serve myself a portion and coming back later to retrieve the plates to carry to another table. It really did feel like all the people in the restaurant were cherished guests in their home. There is no menu, which I absolutely loved. Her parents — Pierrette and Claude — serve only what is in season. However, they will cater to vegetarians as long as they have the ingredients in the kitchen. I’m a fairly picky eater — meaning I rarely eat things like the liver, heart or brains of an animal — so when the first dish came to the table, I knew I had to throw my inhibitions to the wind. It looked like pâté baked into a mold and I was told it was made with all different parts of the chicken. It was extremely flavorful, mixed with seasonings and garlic, and I was shocked that I actually loved this appetizer!I ate until I was full and then ate some more because I didn’t want to be rude — which was typical of my entire week in France. I devoured white asparagus with a delicious vinegar sauce, local lamb with mushrooms and a thin brown sauce, cauliflower au gratin, chips, local goat cheese, and a pancake topped with sugar for dessert (normally crepes with apple filling but they were out of apples).The young woman asked where I had been in the Lot Valley. When I told her of my love for Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, she grinned and said, “If you think that village is beautiful, then you should see Conques — it is even more beautiful than Saint-Cirq-Lapopie.”Well that is convenient because according to my itinerary, I would be visiting Conques later that day! Stay tuned for my take on Conques, France. If you are in the Lot Valley area and would like to try Des Touristes, keep in mind that they are open from early May to mid-October and a reservation is recommended. I highly suggest taking a look around Marcilhac sur Cele after your meal. It’s full of history and gorgeous scenery. Church Ruins in Marcilhac sur Cele Thanks to the Entente Vallée du Lot and Lot Tourisme for hosting my trip to the Lot Valley, France. As always, all opinions are my own. "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/saint-cirq-lapopie-the-most-beautiful-village-in-france,Saint-Cirq-Lapopie: The Most Beautiful Village in France?,France,"I’m thankful I didn’t have any previous expectations of the cliffside village of Saint-Cirq-Lapopie. I didn’t Google any photos before I left for the trip, study any guidebooks or sift through any blog posts, which left me completely surprised that a place like this even existed.It was like a blank canvas that suddenly came to life, to reveal an image more beautiful than I could have even imagined.Tips for Visiting Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, FranceSaint-Cirq-Lapopie is perched on top of magnificent limestone cliffs, overlooking unspoiled views of the Vallée du Lot (the Lot Valley). It was voted France’s favorite village in 2012, and it’s not hard to understand why.This village contains gorgeous stone buildings with brown-tiled roofs that date back to the 13th to 16th centuries. Saint-Cirq-Lapopie has drawn artists from around the world for hundreds of years. Andre Breton, the founder of the Surrealist movement, said, “I no longer want to be anywhere else,” when he spoke of Saint-Cirq-Lapopie.Today, the village has 217 inhabitants and more than 400,000 visitors each year. It didn’t feel overrun with tourists in early May, but you may not get that lucky in the summer months.A stroll through the village and dinner at the very French, Le Gourmet Quercynois, is a must. Try the Foie Gras appetizer — you will not be disappointed. Where to Stay in Saint-Cirq-LapopieIf you are staying overnight in Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, there is a hotel across the way — overlooking the village — called Hotel Le Saint Cirq. My busy itinerary only allowed me to stay here one night, but I wish I had been able to stay an entire week, lounging by the pool or drinking wine in the garden. River CruiseJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Just a few minutes away from Saint-Cirq-Lapopie lies the small village of Bouzies, where Lot Croisieres offers cruises along the river, revealing some of the unique history behind this area.This cave dwelling dates back to the 14th century and it was used as a shelter and a watch post by the English. It is composed of a maize of caves and stairs which leads to the top of the cliffs, whichoffered the English a safe and secret way to escape from the area.Along the river, you will find a towpath, which was carved by hand in the mid 1800s. After the towpath was made, a local artist carved intricate seashells, sand dollars and other designs into the walls of the pathway.I had never visited a village like this previous to my visit to the Lot Valley. Is it the most beautiful village in France? Possibly. It is definitely one of the most beautiful villages I had ever seen, but I still had more of France to explore before I made my final verdict. Plan Your Trip to Saint-Cirq-Lapopie, FranceAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights:Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

By being a solo traveler, you’ll meet a lot of friendly locals, travel on your own schedule, and have an arguably more authentic experience. I will admit that I got a lot of weird looks from locals and travelers when I told them I was traveling alone, but Greece turned out to be one of the safest places I’ve traveled as a solo female.That said, Greece is such a gorgeous place that I often found myself wanting to share it with someone. Yet, even though I was traveling alone, I did meet a lot of friendly locals who invited me into their restaurants for a drink or to chat on their porch.

Take extra precaution in big cities, especially at night and with pickpocketing, and keep general solo travel tips in mind.Also, when you get to your destination, check in with your concierge or Airbnb host and ask what their takes are on the situation. Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Learn Some GreekLearning the local language will come in very handy while in Greece – a country where not everyone speaks English. It’s smart to learn the standard greetings as well as some phrases for if things go awry. Know how to ask for help, how to get local transportation, and how to get to the nearest emergency services such as hospitals.However, stressful situations can wipe out even the best attempts at learning the local language. I recommend writing down key phrases and keep them in your day bag for just in case.

Before you leave for Greece, make sure your cell phone is unlocked, and then buy a local SIM card when you arrive. Smart Traveler Enrollment ProgramThe Smart Traveler Enrollment Program allows US citizens traveling abroad to log their trip with the nearest US Embassy or Consulate. Having your trip to Greece enrolled with this will allow you to receive information about safety conditions in your destination, and allow the embassy (as well as your friends and family) to contact you in case of an emergency. Offline MapsOffline Maps were a lifesaver during my time in Greece. To download offline maps, open the Google Maps App, click on the main menu, find “offline maps”, and then make a new or custom map. I always download maps of my destinations before I leave home.For those wanting to not rely on technology, paper maps work just as well!

Generally, if you politely tell them your lack of interest, they’ll leave you alone.Additionally, if you want to experience the Greek nightlife or hotspots, I recommend joining up on a tour. If you’re backpacking Greece, hostels always have nightlife options but if not, major tour providers often schedule wine tastings and guided nights out. How to Travel Around the Greek IslandsGetting around the Greek Islands is generally easy, with multiple ferry and flight options available. Personally, due to the somewhat haphazard reliability of the ferries, I preferred to fly from island to island, but sometimes the ferry is the only option.Ferries in the Greek Islands are often canceled, so you’ll need to stay flexible. I recommend not booking ferries until you have arrived at your destination, and then ask one of the local booking offices which one they recommend based on the weather forecast and options. Accommodation in GreeceDuring my time in Greece, I mostly stayed at Airbnb’s (with the exception of a splurge hotel in Santorini) and found that Greek hospitality is very real. My hosts often picked me up and dropped me off, brought me homemade food, and they always gave local tips and were more than gracious. Don’t be shy about asking your hosts for help or suggestions, they’ll be happy to do it.In choosing an Airbnb or hotel, look for a place with excellent reviews that’s in a good location.

Do your research and see what other travelers have said about the road and driving conditions in the places you’re visiting. Public Transportation in GreeceMost places in Greece have fairly decent public transportation. On Milos, there is a bus that goes to most of the popular spots, but you will definitely have more freedom in your own car on a small island like this.Car rental locations are fairly easy to come by and, on the smaller islands, ATV’s and scooters are popular too! Plan Your Trip to GreeceAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/where-to-stay-in-santorini-greece,Where to Stay in Santorini: Oia or Imerovigli?,Greece,"Choosing where to stay in Santorini is a tough choice for many travelers. Here’s what you need to know before you choose between Oia or Imerovigli!The Greek island of Santorini is one of the most beautiful destinations in the world, and also one of the most popular. One of the Cyclades Islands set in the Aegean Sea, Santorini is about 28 square miles in size and has a local population of roughly 15,000 spread out over multiple towns and villages — most notably Fira, Imerovigli, Oia, Emporia, Pyrgos, and Perissa.During my time on Santorini, I had the opportunity to stay in both Imerovigli and Oia, two of the most iconic and picturesque towns on the island. Oia, located at the northwestern tip of the island, and Imerovigli, just south of Oia across a small bay, are similar in that they’re historic and set along the rim of the crater (the caldera), yet they have very distinct personalities.After spending time in both towns, I learned the pros and cons of staying in both Oia and Imerovigli. My personal favorite of the two towns is Imerovigli, but I’ll let you decide based on the pros and cons of each.  Table of ContentsWhere to Stay in Santorini: Oia or Imerovigli?ImerovigliPros of Staying in ImerovigliCons of Staying in ImerovigliOiaPros of Staying in OiaCons of Staying in OiaPlan Your Trip to SantoriniWhere to Stay in Santorini: Oia or Imerovigli? ImerovigliLocated only two kilometers away from the capital of Fira, Imerovigli is the perfect oasis if you want a peaceful and relaxing vacation spot. The town is home to just 500 locals and is at the highest and most central part of the caldera, offering unreal views of the Aegean Sea below.During my time in Imerovigli, I stayed at Iconic Santorini – a stunning boutique cave hotel that is perfect for a romantic getaway. The luxury hotel, like so many buildings in the area, is carved directly into the hillside and provides a serene, welcoming setting. Pros of Staying in ImerovigliJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Easy Access to Both Sides of the IslandDue to its relatively central location, if you’re looking for a great spot from which to check out both sides of the island, Imerovigli is the place to be. Getting from the west to the east side of the island makes for a great day hike or, if you want to explore a little further than that, ATV’s and scooters are easily rentable. Amazing ViewWithout a doubt, Imerovigli is home to the most unreal views of the caldera and some of the best photography spots on the island. Not to mention, its high elevation and west-facing facade mean it’s one of the best locations on the island from which to watch the sunset (it’s my personal favorite). Read more: Best Compact Cameras (A Complete Buying Guide) Peaceful AtmosphereCompared to the bustling nature of Oia, Imerovigli is a quiet, peaceful getaway. I found it to be a great place to relax and recharge my batteries while still having tons of sites to see and things to do.Staying at Iconic Santorini is right on the cliff so it feels remote, even with the other cliffside hotels nearby. Each room at Iconic Santorini has its own private outdoor area where they serve a gorgeous breakfast every morning and where I spent the bulk of my time. Most rooms have their own private outdoor plunge pool. My room had its own cave pool INSIDE my room, which felt like the ultimate luxury.The best part about Iconic is that they rarely, if ever, allow the hotel to book at full capacity because they really want people to feel like they have the place to themselves — which I often did. Perfect For a Couples GetawayDue to its chill atmosphere, Imerovigli is well-known as being the perfect place for a romantic getaway on Santorini. Think long strolls through town, peaceful hikes, sipping on wine, and luxurious spa treatments. Read more: The Most Romantic Places To Propose in the World (And Where to Stay!) Greek HospitalityI found the Greek Hospitality to be much more pronounced in Imerovigli than in Oia, perhaps somewhat due to the much lower number of tourists found there. The meals at Iconic Santorini felt like I was welcomed into someone’s home, rather than a hotel restaurant. They literally cater to your every need. Cons of Staying in Imerovigli Less Entertainment OptionsDue to Imerovigli being the quieter location of the two, there is less of a selection of local performances and nightlife spots. That said, Imerovigli is super close to Fira, which has a ton of entertainment options from which to choose. Read more: 25 Best Honeymoon Destinations In The World (And Where To Stay) Not As SocialIn line with the lack of entertainment options, if you’re looking to meet other travelers and have a social experience, you might have more difficulty in Imerovigli than in Oia. That’s not to say you won’t have genuine experiences with locals and see other travelers in Imerovigli, it’s just that Oia attracts more people and has a more outgoing environment. OiaLocated on the northwestern edge of Santorini, Oia extends along the edge of the caldera and is famed for its blue and white houses. The homes and businesses in the town are built into the steep slope of the hill, and narrow passages guide the way throughout.Oia is also one of Santorini’s biggest tourist hotspots, and the paths of the town tend to get very busy during the main and shoulder tourism seasons. I have to say, despite thinking Oia would be my favorite spot on the Island, I found the crowds to be a bit much at times – so definitely take this into consideration if you travel there during tourism high times. Pros of Staying in Oia More Shops and RestaurantsOia is home to a ton of shops and restaurants from which to choose, so if you want to try out different styles of cuisine and do some shopping, Oia is your best bet. More Hotel OptionsWhether you’re looking for a boutique hotel or a cute bed and breakfast, you’ll have tons of options to choose from in Oia. That said, Oia does tend to be more expensive than elsewhere on Santorini, so if you want to stay in Oia on a budget, I recommend looking at hotels just a little outside the main town. Read more: The Most Durable Checked Luggage [Buying Guide] Iconic Photo SpotsWhen people think of Santorini, they’re probably conjuring up an image of Oia in their minds due to the iconic photography locations there. For some great shots, head to Oia Castle at sunset, head to the three blue domes, and spend some time wandering around. Read more: Visiting Greece As A Solo Traveler – Is It Safe? Good NightlifeIf you’re looking to take in some performances or experience the local nightlife, then Oia is the place to be (next to Fira, that is). Whether you’re into romantic bars or beach hangouts, there’s a nightlife spot for you. Cons of Staying in Oia CongestionAs mentioned above, before I went to Santorini I thought Oia was going to be my favorite village on the island.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/croatia-sailing-travel-tips,These 10 Photos Will Make You Want to Sail Around Croatia,Croatia,"If Croatia is on your bucket list, one of the best ways to travel this gorgeous country is by sailing the coastline while visiting a new port every night! Sailing the coast gives you the freedom of visiting multiple locations without the hassle or the stress of renting and driving a car.Sailing Croatia has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. I had been begging Scott to come with me, but the fear of seasickness always prevented us from booking the trip. Yes, I could have gone solo, but I had high hopes that I would finally wear Scott down and convince him to go!When Yacht Getaways — a sister company of MedSailors — invited us to experience one of their trips, it felt like the perfect time to finally say yes. We spent a week in early September in a shared catamaran with four private cabins. We had a blast with our boat mates and ended up becoming great friends with them. I’m happy to report that Scott didn’t get sick — thanks to taking some precautionary seasickness meds!If you’re considering this trip, I highly recommend booking it! I’ve shared a few of our favorite photos from the trip below, as well as some tips and packing essentials. Tips and Inspiration for Sailing the Coast of Croatia Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					  The Best Time to Sail in CroatiaCroatia’s weather is usually sunny and warm from May to October, however, if you’re looking to avoid the crowds, it’s best to visit during the shoulder-season months (May, June, September, or October). You may encounter a storm here and there, but it’s generally limited to 1 or 2 days and the rest of your trip should be blessed with plenty of sun.  Croatia Packing Essentials  Dramamine (Less Drowsy Formula): Even if you don’t normally get seasick, I highly recommend packing some motion sickness pills. These Dramamine tablets won’t make you drowsy like the regular formula! Lightweight Waterproof Windbreaker: A lightweight packable windbreaker is a must-have for any sailing trip. Even if it doesn’t rain, this will block the wind and keep you warm on chilly nights. It’s important to note that if it does rain, having the proper quick-dry waterproof gear is essential because there’s nowhere to dry things on a small boat unless the sun is out. Quick-Dry Beach Towel: Again, quick-drying items are a necessity on a boat. A basic beach towel will work in a pinch, but I recommend bringing a microfiber beach towel which dries three times faster than a cotton towel. Sarong: Sarongs might be one of the best travel fashion pieces because you can wear it in a variation of settings — whether it’s on the boat deck, on the beach, or dressed up as a skirt and paired with a cute top for a night out. Biodegradable Wipes: These biodegradable wipes with tea tree and aloe are perfect for freshening up in the morning or washing your face before bed. Boat showers are not ideal and you’ll likely be sharing a bathroom with another cabin, so it’s always nice to have a back-up plan. Dry Shampoo: Dry shampoo makes it so much easier to skip shampooing your hair daily. This travel size dry shampoo is perfect if you don’t plan to check a bag! Portable Charger: Some of the ports — like the smaller, quiet bays — don’t have electricity, so I recommend bringing a portable charger for your phone. Read More:10 Places to Visit in Europe This SummerRoad Trip Essentials: What to Pack for a Road TripHow to Choose the Best Luggage for Your Next TripHow to Stay Fit While Traveling – 6 Easy Ways!My 25 Best Travel Tips After 10 Years of Traveling the World10 Things You Should Know Before Traveling to Europe Pin it!"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/labadee-haiti-things-to-do,"Labadee, Haiti – More than Meets the Eye",Haiti,"Labadee is a port on the northern coast of Haiti which is leased to Royal Caribbean until 2050. I wasn’t really sure if I would like this stop on our Caribbean cruise, since the thought of a port built by Royal Caribbean sounds extremely commercialized.While the port is definitely geared towards selling tours and souvenirs, there is much more to Labadee than meets the eye.My initial reaction to a huge cruise ship company leasing a portion of an untouched paradise is to automatically assume the worst, but it’s important to see the bigger picture and learn how it can actually improve the lives of some of the locals.According to Wikipedia, “Royal Caribbean International has contributed the largest proportion of tourist revenue to Haiti since 1986, employing 300 locals, allowing another 200 to sell their wares, and paying the Haitian government US$6 per tourist.”Not only that, after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Royal Caribbean donated $1 million to fund relief efforts and to use cruise ships to ferry relief supplies and personnel.In Haiti, going to school isn’t a birthright. Parents must pay up-front for their children to attend school and it’s not cheap. The boat captain who led our shore excursion in Labadee was extremely grateful to have a job so he could send his children to school that year. Free education for children is something we often take for granted and it surprised all of us to learn this unfortunate fact about the education system in Haiti.For those of you who are interested, I found a great cause called the Haiti Education Foundation, where you can donate to help put a child through school.Labadee grew on me, that’s for sure. During our visit, we found one of the best things to do in Labadee, Haiti.Private Beach in Labadee, Haiti Your Own Private BeachWhile most of our fellow cruise ship passengers chose to lounge on the crowded beach just steps away from the dock or zipped through the air on the Dragon’s Breath Zipline (the longest zipline over water), we found a little piece of heaven.My dad, an extremely generous guy, looked into booking a catamaran for all 14 of us to float away to the privately owned beach of Malfini, just a 20 minute boat ride away from the main beach.They limit this private beach to 25 people, so we almost had it all to ourselves. When we ask the kids which stop was their favorite, they all unanimously say Haiti because it felt like one of those once in a lifetime moments.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The beach is set up with comfortable chairs in the shade, plenty of rafts for lounging in the water, cheap beer and fresh (straight from the tree) coconut water for the kids. Needless to say, none of us wanted to leave when the boat came back for us three hours later. For more Caribbean Resources, Visit These Pages:Top 10 Things to Do in ArubaThe 10 Most Romantic Island Getaways in the WorldGetting Scuba Certified in BonaireTop 10 Things to Do in Trinidad & TobagoWhere to Stay in San Juan, Puerto RicoWhere to Stay in Aruba Where to Stay in St. Maarten"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/top-things-to-do-northern-ireland,Top 10 Things To Do in Northern Ireland,Ireland,"While it may be a small region, what Northern Ireland lacks in size it certainly makes up for in, well, everything else. Home to a dramatic coast, medieval castles, green landscapes, Celtic structures, friendly people, and varied history, Northern Ireland has a ton to discover and experience.My recent trip to Northern Ireland showed me a lot of what the region has to offer. From the best in culture, nature and history, these are the top ten things to do in Northern Ireland! Top 10 Things To Do in Northern Ireland  Explore Giant’s CausewayLegend has it that when Irish Giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) picked a fight with Scottish Giant Benandonner, he built a path of around 40,000 stepping-stones that led him all the way from the coast of Northern Ireland to Scotland. When Benandonner saw this, he ripped up the path and left behind what is now Giant’s Causeway.Of course, if you’re more scientifically inclined, then you’ll be keen to note that Giant’s Causeway consists of interlocking basalt columns created about 60 million years ago by a volcanic fissure eruption. The site is located on the North Coast in County Antrim, and there’s nothing like hanging out on the columns and watching the sea dampen the rocks below. This is also a top photography spot, so be sure to bring your camera!  Walk on Carrick-A-Rede Rope BridgeUsed for over 200 years by fisherman who relied on Carrick-A-Rede Island as being one of the best salmon fishing spots in the area, the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge spans about 20 meters and links the mainland to the island.Not only will crossing this bridge give you a rush of adrenaline as you look down to see the sea crashing into the rocks 30 meters below, but you’ll get some unreal views of Scotland and Rathlin Island when you’re on the island as well.

With many different tours to choose from including a Giant’s Causeway Spectacular Tour, a Mussenden Temple Experience, and a LegenDerry adventure, taking a tour will simultaneously give you a history lesson and some can’t-be-beat views.  Visit Titanic BelfastWhether or not you’re a connoisseur of all things Titanic, a visit to the Titanic Belfast museum is an absolute must-do during your visit to Belfast. Not only does this museum have great interactive exhibits on the Titanic itself, it has exhibits honoring Belfast’s maritime heritage and early 20th-century boomtown status.The museum is built on the site of what used to be the Harland & Wolff shipyard, where the RMS Titanic was constructed.  Tour Old Bushmills DistilleryTouted as being Ireland’s oldest licensed distillery, The Old Bushmills Distillery in County Antrim makes the iconic Bushmills Irish Whiskey, and was one of the first distilleries to make both single malts and blended whiskeys in the world.Whether you’re keen on a distillery tour or a tasting experience, the Old Bushmills Distillery simply can’t be missed. Oh, and if you get a chance, definitely try out some of their whiskey jelly – it’s so unique and delicious!

Without getting into too many of the specifics, the castle changed familial hands many times before the corner of it collapsed into the sea, and afterwards fell into disrepair.  Have a Pint in BelfastFor a quintessential Irish experience, grabbing a pint at one of the many pubs in Belfast is an absolute must. Belfast is a town filled to the brim with traditional pubs, all of which will be proud to serve you either a Guinness or the Belfast equivalent – a Yardsman Double Stout.While you’re on the hunt for the perfect pub, take yourself on a bit of a self-guided street art tour. Belfast is home to some really great street art; many pieces with cultural and political references.  Take a Game of Thrones TourIf you’re a Game of Thrones fan in Ireland, there’s no better way to see all the Westeros sites and get the insider stories than by taking a Game of Thrones Tour with Giant Tours Ireland.On the tour, you’ll visit The Stormlands (Larrybane Quarry), Dragonstone Cliffs (Fair Head, Ballycastle), Lordsport Harbour and Pyke (Ballintoy Harbour), The Kingsroad (The Dark Hedges), and so much more. Read more: The Best Travel Cameras (And How To Choose One)  Climb to the Top of Cave HillNot only is a climb to the top of Cave Hill a great way to get unparalleled views of Belfast, but it’s also awesome for exploring the five caves located on the cliffs, checking out Belfast Castle, and discovering interesting archaeological sites. The hill is located in Cave Hill Country Park, which also features a playground for kids.While it is a moderate to challenging route, the hike is totally worth it for the vantage points along the way.

Plus, if you like to eat breakfast on the go, they offer daily Grub to Go bags filled with yogurt, granola, and fruit.  At The Beach B&BIf you’re into gorgeous sea views and stretches of sandy beach, then the luxurious At The Beach B&B in Portstewart is for you. This cute B&B has bright, open-concept rooms that will make you feel right at home. Oh, and make sure to try out their breakfast — it tends to feature a lot of fresh seafood options!  Bushmills InnLocated right near the Old Bushmills Distillery and Giant’s Causeway in the town of Bushmills, Bushmills Inn is a luxury retreat that was originally a Coaching Inn as early as the 1600’s. The 41 individually styled-rooms feature traditional luxury with a cozy, modernized flair, and the property even features a cinema.  Slieve Donard Resort and SpaThe gold standard of Irish luxury, the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa in Newcastle is an award winning property that is perched on six acres of immaculate private grounds.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/game-of-thrones-locations-northern-ireland,10 Game of Thrones Locations to Visit in Northern Ireland,Ireland,"Taking a Game of Thrones tour around Northern Ireland is an absolute must-do for anyone serious about their love for all things Westeros. Northern Ireland, with its intensely beautiful castles, cliffs, and rolling hills, has so far been featured in roughly 25 Game of Thrones shooting locations spread out all over the region.Due to the popularity of the TV show, there is now a whole tourism circuit dedicated to the most popular filming locations, which makes it easy to take either a Game of Thrones guided tour (we highly recommend Flip from Giant Tours Ireland!) or head out on your own. Before you go, remember to download the Game of Thrones Northern Ireland locations app so you know exactly where you’re headed! 10 Game of Thrones Locations to Visit in Northern Ireland  Cushendun Caves – Co. AntrimFormed by being exposed to extreme weather over 400 million years, the Cushendun Caves, although small, are brilliantly beautiful. The caves can be easily accessed from the village of Cushendun; situated on an elevated beach near the Glendun and Glencorp valleys.You’ll recognize the caves from Season 2, Episode 4 in Game of Thrones when they were used as a cove in the Stormlands. You know, the scene where Melisandre was brought ashore by Davos Seaworthy and then gave birth to a shadow baby.  Larrybane Quarry – Co. AntrimWhile Larrybane Quarry is now technically an overflow parking lot for the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge, it is still just as enchanting as when it was featured in Game of Thrones. The Quarry is characterized by steep, white cliffs that rise from the landscape, and incredible views of the sea and Rathlin Island in the distance.Notably, Larrybane Quarry was used in Season 2, Episode 3 of Game of Thrones when Brienne of Tarth fought and beat Lord Tyrell, and Catelyn Stark meets King Renly.

AntrimOne of the most iconic and photographed sites in Northern Ireland, The Dark Hedges are a haunting row of beech trees that line the road to Gracehill House. The Stuart family planted the trees in the 18th century as a way to impress their visitors.Known in Game of Thrones as Kingsroad, The Dark Hedges were featured in Season 2, Episode 1 when Arya Stark disguised herself as a boy and traveled through the trees as she escaped from King’s Landing (along with Gendry, Yoren, and Hot Pie going to join the Night’s Watch).  Castle Ward – near Strangford, Co. DownSituated on a lush hillside overlooking Strangford Lough, Castle Ward is an 18th century mansion-house that has been home to the Ward family since the 16th century. The house is surrounded by 820 acres of walled land on which you’ll find sunken gardens and 34km of trails that can be used for hiking or cycling.Castle Ward was primarily used in Game of Thrones Season 1 as Winterfell, and is home to many early GOT memories. For example, this is where King Robert Baratheon and company arrived and were met by the Stark family, and where Bran was taught to shoot an arrow by Jon Snow and Robb Stark.  Ballintoy Harbour – Co. AntrimA historical fishing and trade spot, Ballintoy Harbour is made up of rocky shores and brilliant cliffs. The Harbour can be located by taking a narrow, steep road from the village of Ballintoy, which passes by the entrances to Larrybane and the Carrick-A-Rede Rope Bridge.In Season 2 of Game of Thrones, Ballintoy was used as the town of Lordsport on the Isle of Pyke. Specifically, in Episode 2, this was the place that Theon Greyjoy returned home to after being disloyal to the Starks. Read more: The Ultimate Road Trip Packing Guide  Downhill Beach – Co. LondonderryLocated on the Causeway Coast in the very north of Northern Ireland, Downhill Beach is an 11km stretch of land and is well-known as being the home of the Mussenden Temple, which overlooks the beach from its 120-ft perch. If you’re looking for some activities to do while at Downhill Beach, you can partake in some water sports, or go for a scenic walk and explore nearby waterfalls.Downhill Beach was repeatedly featured in Season 2 of Game of Thrones when it was transformed into Dragonstone. Famously, in Episode 1, this is where Stannis pulled the flaming sword and Melisandre chanted, “For the night is dark and full of terrors.”  The Titanic Quarter – Belfast, Co. AntrimLocated on Belfast’s waterfront, the Titanic Quarter is home to an entertainment district, maritime landmarks, the Titanic Museum, and, specifically interesting to Game of Thrones fans, Titanic Film Studios. The studios are where many inside scenes of the show were filmed.  Meet the Direwolves – Strangford, Co. DownFirst introduced in the opening scenes of Season 1, the Direwolves were adopted by the Stark children after they found the orphaned pups in the Wolfswood. In real life, the Direwolves are domestically bred Northern Inuit dogs, and you can visit two of them, Summer and Grey Wind (real names Odin and Thor, respectively).When not touring around, Odin and Thor live in Strangford County, just 40 minutes south of Belfast, meeting their many fans. Read more: How To Book The Absolute Cheapest Flights To Anywhere  The Cuan Restaurant – Strangford, Co. DownWhile not a filming location, the Cuan Restaurant was where the cast slept and dined while they were filming the first two seasons of Game of Thrones at Winterfell Castle. Due to this connection, the Cuan Restaurant now offers special Game of Thrones banquets, where you can dine in a banquet hall transformed to look like the one at Winterfell, or have a picnic at your favorite nearby Game of Thrones filming location.During these banquets, you can dress up like a Stark and eat special food inspired by the Winterfell dining options. Plus, if you really want to go all out, the Cuan even offers a special GOT-themed murder mystery banquet experience.  Dunluce Castle – Bushmills, Co. AntrimPerched on the edge of some dramatic cliffs along the coast, the ruins of Dunluce Castle were used as the filming site of House Greyjoy of Pyke, ruler of the Iron Islands. Of course, a little CGI may have gone into transforming these ruins into what you see on screen.In real life, Dunluce castle was built around the year 1500 by the MacQuillan family, was seized in the 1550’s by the MacDonnell family, and then was taken over as the seat of the earls of County Antrim in the 17th century before falling into disrepair (and the sea) shortly thereafter. Plan Your Trip to Northern IrelandAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/dublin-ireland-layover-tips,"How to Spend a Layover in Dublin, Ireland",Ireland,"Ever dreamed of visiting the beautiful green country of Ireland, but haven’t had the time or funds to do so? Dublin is a popular layover destination for those traveling eastward to Europe, so take advantage of your stop and stretch it into an extra one-day mini vacation!With a little preparation and planning, you can see a little slice of the Emerald Isle and spend an entire day experiencing some of the best things the capital city of Dublin has to offer. How to Spend a Long Layover in Dublin, Ireland When using your favorite flight comparison site, take a close look at the various itineraries they offer to your final destination. I happened to be traveling to Hamburg when I saw the option of enduring either multiple 4-5 hour layovers in various cities or one 20 hour layover in Dublin; I had always wanted to see Ireland, so I thought I’d turn an otherwise exhausting day of traveling into a fun day trip!I knew I’d have limited time upon arriving in Dublin, so I made a tentative itinerary beforehand and got to visit nearly all of the stops on my list. If you only have one day in this charming city, check out my collection of must-see places. Get a LEAP CardFirst and foremost, head to Dublin airport’s information center in Terminal A and purchase a one-day LEAP card (about €10). This card will give you unlimited transportation on buses and trams throughout the city for 24 hours, including the bus to/from the airport. The information desk will give you a map of all bus stops throughout Dublin, though I’d suggest downloading the Journey Planner app that will give you exact bus numbers and arrival times to specific stops you choose.I bought the card primarily to save on the bus fare to and from the airport — as one-way trips without the card cost about €7 — but otherwise, Dublin is actually a very walkable city. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes as the streets are cobblestone, but walking throughout the quaint, historic streets is most definitely the best way to get around. Old Jameson DistilleryThe Old Jameson Distillery on Bow Street is an obvious draw for anyone visiting Ireland for the first time.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					With their whiskey-tasting experience comes a guided tour rich with anecdotes of Jameson history, the opportunity to shop for souvenirs, and, of course, whiskey! Though they no longer actually make their famous whiskey here, nearly everyone that has ever visited says this is a must-see stop — and I wholeheartedly agree. Guinness StorehouseThe Guinness Storehouse is both a brewery and a museum, and well worth the entry fee. This is a must-see.Purchase tickets in advance online for a cheaper rate than at the door, and let the fully immersive experience begin! Learn to pour your own pint, get a glimpse of how Guinness is made, and make the climb to the rooftop Gravity Bar for a panoramic view of Dublin. Dublin CastleTake a self-guided tour (the guided tours can last over an hour) around the Dublin Castle, a massive landmark right in the center of the city. Ireland is well-known for its ancient castles, and the opportunity to see one inside and out firsthand can’t be surpassed. Trinity College Old LibraryThe Book of Kells — actually a small collection of books — can be seen after a self-guided tour through the literatures’ Celtic history, though Trinity College’s library alone is enough to make your jaw drop. Marble busts of famous authors and philosophers adorn the long hall, and ancient books fill the towering ceiling-high shelves; pictures can’t do this place justice! Temple BarTemple Bar is an area of Dublin known for its plentiful pubs, boutique stores, and various places of entertainment. Grab a Guiness and bite to eat (no tipping necessary!) and be sure to watch an indie film at the Irish Film Institute. You can even visit the original Temple Bar and listen to live Irish music every day of the week! St. Stephens GreenSt. Stephens Green is not an essential stop, but a beautiful one nonetheless. Statues, swans, fountains, and gorgeous green scenery make this park a sight for sore eyes after being on a long-haul flight.If you’re lucky enough to snag a flight from Dublin to your ultimate destination that departs at night, you’re one of the few; most long-layover flights depart early morning, leaving you without a place to sleep for the night. Thankfully, the time difference and my evening latte allowed me to stay awake through the night and work from the airport’s lounge. However, I found there were plenty of places to stay — via Airbnb — within close proximity to the airport for €20-€30.While I can’t generally say I love layovers, I loved this one; a memorable day spent in the heart of Ireland is well worth the extra day added to any trip! Read More:8 Incredibly Safe Island Destinations for Solo Travelers10 Best Tips for Traveling EuropeWhat to Pack for a Trip to IcelandHow to Travel Expensive Countries Affordably8 Amazing Places to Visit in WalesThe Best Cameras for Travel Photo credits: Tony Webster, Neil Turner"

May in Israel offers near perfect weather and scenery, minimal tourists swarming popular attractions, and low prices for airfare and hotels.Round-trip flight costs from the United States generally hover between $800 – $1000 in May depending on your departing location and days of the week you travel. November is also an inexpensive alternative time to visit, but after a long, dry summer, it definitely doesn’t have the scenic appeal spring has.Although you can book a flight with Israel’s national El Al Air through their independent website, I’ve found Turkish Airlines can be significantly cheaper. However, if you do choose to fly El Al, be prepared for their highly extensive security customs!This is one of the world’s safest airlines to travel on, so you can expect high scrutiny even on outbound flights in international airports everywhere. Luggage is often hand-checked, and individual interviews are conducted with personal questions reaching from occupation or reason for traveling to place of origin or religion practiced. Weather in IsraelWhile the country is small — about the size of New Jersey — the weather and climates varies depending on your geographical location within Israel.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					You can expect hot dry summers nationwide from April to October, but northern and coastal areas typically have cool, rainy winters in comparison to the arid climate inland in the south and east. Where to Stay in IsraelTwo of the most popular destinations in Israel for tourists are the sacred sites of Jerusalem and the thriving beach city of Tel Aviv, both centrally located in the center of the country to allow for easy accessibility to most landmarks. Our favorite places to stay have the perfect balance of indulgence and authentic Mediterranean culture!JerusalemTop Budget Picks (Under $200): St. George’s Cathedral Pilgrim Guesthouse, Legacy HotelTop Luxury Picks: Mount Zion Boutique Hotel, Leonardo Plaza Hotel JerusalemTel AvivTop Budget Picks (Under $200): Dizengoff Suites, The DiaghilevTop Luxury Picks: Royal Beach Hotel Tel Aviv,  65 Hotel How to Get Around IsraelIf you simply plan on traveling within a particular city or to/from other major cities and tourist attractions, buses are the best and easiest way to commute. Buses with popular routes often fill up quickly, so I’d highly recommend buying your ticket in advance.Rental cars are available if you plan to explore the coast or venture off the beaten path, but in major cities they’re inconvenient and totally unnecessary; taxis and buses are generally inexpensive and always available. Best Places to Visit in Israel Akko and Old Akko MarketThe bazaar and quaint suk market in the coastal city of Akko is the perfect spot to spend an hour or two. Be sure to also check out the fortress and take a tour of the Turkish baths! JerusalemThe holy city has been a sacred place for the religious and spiritual for innumerable years, but the beauty of this ancient city has so much to offer anyone looking to indulge themselves in history. JaffaThis old seaside town just south of Tel Aviv is a stark contrast to the modern design of the neighboring big city. Take a walking tour, enjoy the the intricate architecture, and sunset gaze at the port! The biblically historical neighboring town Neve Tzedek has also become a popular, thriving location with charming streets and village-like atmosphere. Sea of GalileeThe large fresh water reservoir fed by the Jordan River is an awesome place to experience Israel’s natural beauty! On the banks of the Sea of Galilee is the Town of Jesus in Capernaum — a historically rich, now uninhabited archaeological site well worth checking out. The Western WallReligious or not, it’s likely you’ve heard of the Western Wall (also called the Wailing Wall). The holiest place where people of the Jewish faith are permitted to pray, the Western Wall is a site where many have come to celebrate, mourn, pray, and even bury prayer notes within the wall for centuries. The Dead SeaAnother must-see, the Dead Sea — the lowest point on Earth — has the spa benefits of ultra-salty water and mineral rich black mud. The sea itself is slowly shrinking due to the Middle East’s hot climate, so visit while you can!Also, go on a food tour if you can — the food in Israel is amazing! For the adventurous, take a desert safari or dive the Red Sea in Eilat. Additional TipsIt’s important to consider the traditions and customs of highly traditional residents and follow local rules accordingly. In Orthodox-Jew neighborhoods, women ideally shouldn’t be in public alone without a male companion.When visiting a Jewish site or place of worship, men should also consider bringing along a kipper or even simple baseball cap since you’ll more than likely be respectfully asked to cover your head. Women might want to wear a shawl that can be used to cover their head when needed.As to no-travel areas, do not enter the Gaza Strip, West Bank, or regions bordering Syria, Egypt, or Lebanon; all are considered extremely dangerous and high-risk due to high military conflict and activity. Packing Essentials for Israel  Electrical Adapters: A must-have item! Electrical outlets in Israel require three round-pegged prongs, so buy a few of these electrical adapters before your trip and store them in your carry-on.  Appropriate Clothing: Although it may be uncomfortably hot in the summers, it’s absolutely critical men and women both pack modest clothing in respect for the religious sites and culture. As a rule of thumb, I would recommend packing light cotton shirts (covering at least to the elbows) and pants or long maxi-skirts if you’re looking to visit religious sites, or travel through Jerusalem or Orthodox Jew neighborhoods.Other than that, Israel is a relatively modern and westernized country where shorts and tank tops are acceptable.  Sunscreen: Sunscreen is very expensive in Israel, so be sure to pack enough for your entire trip! Small, portable sunscreen sticks can easily be carried in a pocket or purse and are convenient for reapplying throughout the day.If you think you’ll need a larger bottle of sunscreen, buy it after you go through security at your departing airport; even though it’ll likely be more expensive than purchasing a bottle at your regular drugstore, it’ll still be about 50% less than in Israel!  Sun Hat: Skin cancer and sun protection is of great concern in the Middle East, so keep your face covered with a sun hat! Also keep a swimsuit cover-up on hand for trips to the Dead Sea, Sea of Galilee, hotel pools and the beach.  Comfortable Shoes: Comfortable shoes with rubber soles are usually best, given the added grips ensures no accidental slips on smooth stone surfaces. Sandals or slip-on sneakers are recommended, as you’ll be asked to remove them before entering places of worship. Read More:How to Travel Expensive Countries AffordablyIs it Worth Visiting Israel if You’re Not Religious?7 Restaurants You Don’t Want to Miss in IsraelThe Best Carry-On Luggage for Every BudgetI Found the Fountain of Youth in Israel12 Places to Travel While the U.S. Dollar is Strong "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/best-restaurants-israel,7 Restaurants You Don’t Want to Miss in Israel,Israel,"Israel is a small country, but they have no shortage of unique and mouth-watering cuisine. I was lucky enough to have a local guide showing me around the country, so a good portion of my trip was centered around tasting as many different types of cuisine as possible — often for hours at a time.It’s not just Israeli food that you will find in Israel. Some of my favorite dishes came from nearby countries — which, of course, makes sense considering Israel is such a melting pot of cultures.From the best hummus in Israel to delectable Iraqui Kubbah Soup, here are my seven favorite restaurants in Israel. Top 7 Restaurants in Israel Humus Said in Akko (Acre)Humus Said is known for serving the best hummus in Akko — and possibly in all of Israel. It’s located in the market of the old city and there is always a line out the door, with tourists and locals who can’t get enough of their secret recipe. They serve a variety of Mediterranean dishes in addition to their famous hummus — and the portions are large, so you won’t leave hungry! Uri Buri in Akko (Acre)Uri Buri is a friendly and very well-known local who is more than happy to talk about food as long as you prefer. His gourmet seafood restaurant in Akko — which is named after him — is one of the few places I’ve ever been willing to try unknown seafood dishes. He can make any fish taste good, in my opinion.The “tasting menu” is a must here. Once your waiter determines what you don’t (or won’t) eat, they begin bringing small portions of a variety of dishes until you are full. Decks in TiberiasDecks is located on Gdud Barak Street in the town of Tiberias. This restaurant is considered Kosher barbeque and serves up some killer meat dishes. I highly recommend sitting on their huge outdoor deck, which overlooks the Sea of Galilee. They use ancient roasting methods to cook a variety of meat, poultry, fish and vegetables — all seasoned to perfection. Social Club in Tel AvivSpeaking of meat, one of the best rib eye steaks I have ever had was served at the Social Club in Tel Aviv. Every dish I tasted from this elegantly-designed restaurant was to die for — the freshest tomatoes, creamy potato puree, mint shrimp kebabs, pasta dishes and more.The Social Club is located at 45 Rothschild Boulevard (in the piazza behind Max Brenner). Reservations are recommended! Vicki Christina in Tel AvivJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Named after the Woody Allen movie, this tapas and wine bar offers wonderful outdoor seating, underneath one of Tel Aviv’s oldest trees. It’s a great place to dine with a group of friends, where you can order an assortment of tapas to share. I highly recommend the Beet Carpaccio, Camarones a la Broqueta and Ensalada de Escarola.Vicki Christina is located at 1 Koifmann Street at the Station Complex in Neve Tzedek, Tel Aviv. Azura Restaurant in JerusalemAzura Restaurant was my first experience with Iraqui cuisine and I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I ate here as part of Shuk Bites, a food tour at the Machne Yehuda Market, a self-guided tour where you can sample six different restaurants in the market.Going with the beet theme of the trip, I ordered the Kubbah Soup — a sweet and sour soup with beets and dumplings. HaChatzer in JerusalemHaChatzer is located in the Old Train Station area of Jerusalem, at 7 Derech Beth Lehem Road. Its a chef-owned restaurant where the Kosher cuisine is continually praised as some of the best in Israel.I wish I could tell you what to order here, but honestly, the chef just kept bringing out dishes and there wasn’t a single thing I didn’t love. I know my meal involved melt-in-your-mouth falafel, a creamy eggplant dip, beef carpaccio and perfectly-seasoned fish. Are you hungry yet?"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/dead-sea-israel,"The Dead Sea, Israel: I Found The Fountain Of Youth",Israel,"“Do you feel like children again?” our guide asked as our van climbed toward Sea Level.I didn’t know how to respond or what she was getting at — and apparently neither did anybody else because the van fell silent.“It is said that you will turn back time twenty years by swimming in the Dead Sea, so you must feel like children,” she continued.“Ah, yes. I do feel giddy now that you mention it,” I replied from the back of the van. The Dead Sea, Israel: I Found The Fountain Of Youth I had never given much thought to the healing properties of the Dead Sea. I always thought it would be fun to float effortlessly in the heavily-salted water, but I didn’t delve much into the health effects.The drive to the Dead Sea in Israel is full of twisting turns and endless views of the crystal-clear water below. Along the way, we made a pit stop at Sea Level, where a man tried to coax us into paying him a dollar to photograph his camel. We passed Jericho (believed to be one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world) and further down the road, our guide pointed out the cave where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found.We arrived at Mineral Beach in the late afternoon, just as the sun began to sink behind the mountains. After changing into our suits, we hurried down the hill to snag some chairs and drag them to the water’s edge.Salt on the rocks along the shore of the Dead Sea There was no shortage of people giggling in the water or capturing those classic reading-a-newspaper-while-floating-in-the-Dead-Sea photos. I inched my way into the water — it was colder than I had anticipated — and once the waterline hit my waist, I let the buoyancy take over.The salty water lifted my feet to the surface and I immediately felt like I was floating on a raft. No treading water — just resting peacefully in the Dead Sea.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The water made my skin tingle, similar to what it feels like after I’ve surfed for a few hours in the ocean — but multiplied by ten. The Dead Sea is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean, which makes this water too harsh for any living creatures to survive in. But, short dips in the sea has been shown to heal many ailments.Think of it like a huge Epsom salt bath. Supposedly, the magnesium in the water can decrease stress, reduce inflammation, and improve the use of oxygen in the body, while the bromide salts are a mild germicide.Whether the healing properties are scientifically proven or just a placebo effect, I felt refreshed and content after spending just fifteen minutes in the water. I guess you could say I was a kid again, even if it was only for a few hours. Things To Know Before You Go To The Dead Sea:Mineral Beach is located on the Israeli side of the Dead Sea. The entrance fee is 50 or 60 Shekels (depending on the day of the week) for adults and 30 or 35 Shekels for children. They offer other amenities on the property, such as a sulphur water pool, fresh water pool and spa treatments. Read More:Top 12 Vegan-Friendly Travel DestinationsThe Ultimate Israel Travel Guide & Packing TipsThe Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel PhotographersHow to Keep in Touch While Traveling AbroadThe Best Travel Shoes For Women (And How to Choose)Is it Worth Visiting Israel if You’re Not Religious?7 Restaurants You Don’t Want to Miss in Israel "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/religion-travel-israel,Is it Worth Visiting Israel if You’re Not Religious?,Israel,"Many tourists travel to Israel to learn more about their religious roots, but is this the only reason to visit?I’ve been struggling with putting my thoughts about my time in Israel into words. I’m not a religious person, so I wasn’t sure how I would feel about visiting a country with so much religious history.Since I’ve always been better at expressing myself through photos, I think a series of photos accompanying my first impressions of Israel seems appropriate.If you follow us on Instagram, then you may have seen some of these already, but I added a couple more to this post — which I have yet to share anywhere else. Is it Worth Visiting Israel if You’re Not Religious? Landing in NYC to catch my connecting EL AL Airlines Flight Nearly half of the passengers on my overnight flight to Israel were dressed in traditional Hasidic attire — a dark three-piece suit and black hat, with long curly locks of hair known as “Payos.” At first light (Israel time) I awoke to a large portion of the plane praying in the aisles and emergency exit spaces — many of them wearing Tefillin.Sea of Galilee — Where Jesus Walked on Water I traveled to the Sea of Galilee — which looks more like a lake — on my first day in the country. If you have read the bible, then you probably already know this is where Jesus walked on water.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Town of Jesus Continuing my tour of holy sites, I visited the Town of Jesus in Capernaum. This cat looked a lot like my kitty who passed away this year. It felt like a good omen or just a nice welcome to Israel.Surfing in Tel Aviv — In Front of the David Intercontinental Hotel After Tiberias and Capernaum, I made my way to Tel Aviv — where apparently surfing is a popular sport. I had no idea. Nobody back home (ahem… Scott) believed me when I told them there are waves in Israel.The Western Wall (AKA Wailing Wall) in Jerusalem The Western Wall is an important site for those of Jewish faith and has been a site for Jewish prayer and pilgrimage for centuries. The courtyard is separated into two areas — one for the men and one for the women. It is said that if you write a prayer on a piece of paper and insert it into the cracks, then your prayer has a better chance of being heard by God.The Dead Sea at Sunset (with a View of Jordan) Young Soldiers in Front of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem Military service is mandatory for all citizens of Israel after the age of eighteen. It’s not uncommon to see young soldiers walking the streets with guns.Turkish Bazaar in the Old City of Akko (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) Floating in the Dead Sea Young Girl in Akko Akko Market Chicken on a Wire in the Artistic Neighborhood of Neve Tzedek Cafe in Neve Tzedek Nahalat Shiv’a in Jerusalem Now to answer the question in the title of this post: Is it worth visiting Israel if you’re not religious? After spending eight days in the country, I’ve decided there is plenty more to this country than religious sites.I explored areas from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea — and even though I did enjoy learning about the religious history of this country, it’s hardly the only reason to visit. In the coming weeks, I’ll be sharing my thoughts about the local cuisine, browsing the street markets, the surf scene in Tel Aviv and meeting friendly locals. Getting to IsraelNow that EL AL Airlines offers direct flights from LAX to Tel Aviv (yay!) it’s become so much easier for those of us on the West Coast to travel to Israel. I drove from San Diego to LAX and booked a Park and Fly reservation at Four Points LAX. I usually despise traveling all the way to Los Angeles in order to catch a flight, but staying here made it surprisingly easy, even with a 4am wake up call.The shuttle to the airport was waiting outside in the morning for the less-than-five-minute ride to the airport. I also highly recommend checking out their beer selection at Brewsters Bar downstairs, which will put you right to sleep! Read More:The Ultimate Israel Travel Guide + Packing TipsHow To Find Cheap Flights To Anywhere (Insider Tips & Tricks)Must-Have Drone Accessories for Travel PhotographersTop 12 Vegan-Friendly Travel DestinationsThe Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel Photographers (Tips From a Pro!)7 Restaurants You Don’t Want to Miss in Israel "

These 11 must-visit sights cover the top attractions and a few lesser-known spots you won’t want to miss!With its spectacular landscapes, hospitable culture, travel-friendliness, and Northern Lights reputation, Iceland sits at the top of many travelers’ bucket list. In fact, there are so many great spots to experience in the country, it can be tough to know where to start.While the entire country is an adventurer’s dream destination, here are our picks for the top places to see in Iceland! The Best Places to Visit in Iceland Blue LagoonThe Blue Lagoon is Iceland’s most popular attraction, and it’s easy to see why. The lagoon is a geothermal spa located in a lava field in Grindavík, and the toasty warm seawater is chalk full of minerals such as silica, which will rejuvenate and hydrate your skin. Not to mention, the water’s milky blue luminescence makes it one of the most popular places in Iceland for photography. Don’t forget to bring your swimsuit!To enjoy time at the Blue Lagoon, you’ll have to pre-book. Being only 20 minutes from the airport, it’s recommended to plan your visit either right when you arrive in Iceland, or right before you depart. The Golden CircleThe Golden Circle is a 300-km route that loops from Reykjavik through some of Southwest Iceland’s most popular, and photogenic, natural sights. The route is easily done in a day, and you can expect to spend anywhere from 4-8 hours on it; depending on how often you stop at each sight to hike or take photos.Highlights on The Golden Circle include Thingvellir National Park, Geysir Geothermal Area, Gullfoss Waterfall, and Icelandic Horses.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Gullfoss WaterfallGullfoss Waterfall, located in the Hvítá river canyon along the Golden Circle route, is one of Iceland’s most popular, and breathtaking, tourist attractions. Only one and a half hours from Reykjavik, the waterfall stands 32 meters high and flows through a three-step “staircase” before pouring down over two tiers.What makes this waterfall so interesting is that you’ll be viewing it from the height of the upper lakebed, cascading and crashing into the river below! Read more: What to Pack for a Trip to Iceland Jökulsárlón LagoonAlso known as Glacier Lagoon, Jökulsárlón is right next to Vatnajökull, Europe’s largest glacier, and is famed for the magnificent icebergs that dot the landscape. The lagoon is particularly striking as it is home to both a black sand beach that sharply contrasts its blue waters, and, in the wintertime, seals! Skógafoss WaterfallStanding tall at 60 meters high, this stunning waterfall is one of the biggest in Iceland, and it sits only a few kilometers away from the Southern Coast along the Ring Road. A sight that can’t be missed, on a sunny day the mist from the falls forms glittering rainbows against the cliffs — it makes for a great photo op!To get the best view of the waterfall, hike 527 meters up the side of the falls; it’s definitely worth the effort! Seljalandsfoss WaterfallSituated along Iceland’s Southern coast, this spectacular waterfall is fed by melting ice from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. While this waterfall’s front is spectacular in its own right, the real magic is that you can view it from behind. Imagine viewing a luscious field through the cascading water and that should be enough to get you to visit this site.Given the nature of the activity though, definitely think ahead and bring waterproof gear, such as a rain cover for your backpack and a raincoat, as it can get a little misty. Read more: Everything You Need to Know About Traveling Iceland in a Campervan Goðafoss WaterfallSet in Northeastern Icleand at the top of the Sprengisandur highland road (and easily accessible from the Ring Road), Goðafoss is a semi-circular waterfall that translates roughly as The Waterfall of The Gods.Standing at 12 meters tall and 30 meters across, it’s said that in the year 999, Christianity was made the official religion of Iceland, and so Pagan statues were thrown into the waterfall to mark the occasion, thus the name. Sólheimasandur Airplane WreckIn 1973, an American Navy DC plane crashed on the black sand beach on the Southern Iceland coast between Skógafoss waterfall and the town of Vik. Thankfully, everyone in the crash survived, the plane was left at the scene, and the site has become a huge tourist attraction due to its now haunting beauty.For an even more ethereal experience, come to this spot when the Northern Lights are visible! Reynisfjara Black Sand BeachLocated near the small fishing village of Vík í Mýrdal, the Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach is one of the most epic black sand beaches in all of Iceland. Between its lava formations, cliffs, caves, and basalt columns, known as Reynisdrangar, this beach will make you feel like you stepped into another world.According to Icelandic folklore, the columns were once trolls trying to pull in ships from the ocean. However, as their luck would have it, the trolls turned into stone upon sunrise. Now, they make for an otherworldly viewing experience as well as awesome photography subjects!

Along with a river running through it, there is a waterfall on the West side of the canyon that you’ll easily be able to see from an observation platform on the Eastern edge. Snaefellsnes PeninsulaLocated in Western Iceland, the Snaefellsnes Peninsula is home to some incredible, and dramatic, natural landscapes. The area is home to everything from black sand beaches, white sand beaches, glaciers, lava fields, and volcanoes.Some of the highlights of the peninsula include Kirkjufell Mountain, Kirkjufellsfoss Waterfall, Snaefellsjokull National Park, Snaefellsjokull Glacier, and Olkelda Mineral Spring!

Bring multiple pairs of long underwear or leggings, tank tops, and long-sleeved shirts.  Waterproof Outerwear: Between the frequent rain, waterfalls, and chilly climate, you’re going to want to stock up on waterproof gear. Bring a pair of water-resistant snow boots, a hooded jacket, and a durable pair of waterproof-breathable pants. If your favorite items aren’t waterproof, spray a couple of layers of Scotchguard Heavy Duty Water Shield on your outerwear to create an extra water-resistant layer.To protect your electronics from the elements, be sure to bring a rain cover for your backpack, a rain sleeve for your camera, and a poncho (trust me, you’ll want this if you plan on getting close to any waterfalls!)  Warm Accessories: While you may be prepared for Iceland’s notorious rain, you definitely want to factor in the wind as well! We recommend a knit beanie hat, a warm scarf, and a warm winter gloves to keep you toasty warm. Sleep Mask: If you travel to Iceland in the summertime, remember that because it’s so far North, the sun rises around 3am and doesn’t set until around midnight. To ensure you get some much-needed rest on your trip, we recommend this dark, face-forming sleep mask.On the other hand, if you travel to Iceland in the wintertime, you’re going to want a headlamp to help you through the long nights! Swimsuit and Towel: If you plan on taking a dip in any of Iceland’s geothermal pools, such as the Blue Lagoon, you’re going to want to bring a swimsuit (or two)! Make sure you bring along a quick-drying towel as well. "

The mystical falls are the perfect place to take ground-to-sky pictures with a wide lens so you can get the waterfall in frame as well as the backdrop of the precipice with the sky behind it. Sólheimasandur Airplane WreckStarkly contrasting the natural with the artificial, the Sólheimasandur Airplane Wreck is one of the most iconic Icelandic photo destinations due to its haunting beauty and wild history. The 40-year old aircraft has begun to be reclaimed by nature, making it an epic spot to photograph. For an out-of-this-world shot, try and coordinate your visit with a Northern Lights appearance!

On a sunny day, the mist from the falls forms rainbows against the cliffs — making for impossibly magical photos.Skogafoss Waterfall in Southern Iceland Reynisfjara Black Sand BeachThis volcanic beach gives rise to some truly spectacular basalt columns, lava formations and endless cliffs and caves. This rugged and wild stretch of coast is an absolute dream to photograph both in the early morning and at sunset when the light accentuates the jagged volcanic formations. Similar to much of Southern Iceland, Reynisfjara really does make you feel like you’ve stepped onto another planet. Fjadrargljufur CanyonAt the risk of never being able to pronounce it correctly, a visit to Fjadrargljufur Canyon is more than worth the effort.

Remember to be ready for a hike or two if you want the best shots! JökulsárlónFamed for its enormous and beautifully regal icebergs, Jökulsárlón (also known as Glacier Lagoon) is a glacial lagoon that could easily be mistaken for Antarctica. The black sand beach peppered with shocking white icebergs makes for the perfect location to play with monochrome photography.Getting the ideal nature photo can be difficult with other tourists around, so try to arrive early in the morning if you want an isolated wilderness shot. Diamond BeachA stone’s (or ice-cube’s!) throwaway is Diamond Beach, one of the most breathtakingly photogenic beaches in Iceland. Huge chunks of smooth, dazzlingly blue ice are deposited on the beach and with the changing tidal waters, you never quite know what the layout of the beach is going to be until you get there. Appropriately named for their brilliance, the chunks of ice are almost perfectly transparent, making for some mesmerizing close-up photos. Dyrholaey PeninsulaA short detour from the Ring Road, the Dyrholaey Peninsula is a coastal photographer’s dream. Low tides create perfectly still reflective waters that you can use to capture surrealist images of the beautiful headland mirrored in the beach. A must-see at sunrise or sunset! Read More:Instagram vs Reality: Behind The Scenes Of My Best Travel PhotosWhat to Pack for a Trip to NorwayHow to Travel in Norway on a BudgetWhat to Pack for a Trip to ScotlandHow to Travel Switzerland on a BudgetThe Best Photography Locations in California"

In addition to your waterproof gear, pack a knit beanie, insulated gloves, and thick scarf — your head and hands will thank you for it.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Dark Sleep MaskFirst time traveling to Iceland? In summer months the sun rises at 3am and sets at midnight, and even when it does set, sunlight still lingers and keeps the sky bright. With all that sun, that’s only a few hours of semi-darkness per night. If you plan on getting any sleep at all, you will absolutely need a dark, face-forming eye mask.On the other hand, there’s only a handful of hours of sunlight in winter months; if you’re willing to brave the long nights of December and January, you may want a headlamp instead! Water Protection for ElectronicsWaterproof everything you value, because it is bound it get wet at some point on your trip. Pack a rain cover to protect clothes and electronics in your backpack, a rain sleeve for cameras, and a poncho in case you get caught in adverse weather or if you plan on getting close to any large waterfalls.Protecting your phone is important, and getting a “lifeproof” phone case like Otterbox would certainly do the trick. However, if you don’t like the bulkiness of these cases, you can bring a phone drybag — it’s a convenient and easy alternative. Travel Camera & EquipmentFew opportunities present themselves to capture so much natural beauty in one place, and Iceland gives you just that! Even the most novice photographers won’t miss out on some high-quality photos to remember your trip by.Along with a compact travel camera, be sure to bring a travel tripod, batteries, and additional memory cards. Don’t forget a portable charger and a universal plug adapter for charging batteries!Whoops! It looks like you forgot to specify your html tag.

There are just too many opportunities to explore the hot geothermal pools the country is known for and if you’re traveling by campervan, you’ll need a towel for showering. Plus, you won’t want to head back home before visiting the Blue Lagoon just a 40 minute drive south of Reykjavik. Small First-Aid KitSince most adventures in Iceland entail scenic hikes and outdoor activities, I’d highly recommend keeping a small first-aid kit with all the bare necessities in your travel/hiking backpack. Don’t get one so big that it takes up a ton of valuable space in your bag, but if you’re somewhere remote and end up needing it you’ll be SO thankful you brought it along!  Additional Iceland Packing Tips Look at the Tag!Check out your closet; if you don’t already own some, consider buying clothing made of ultra-warm and insulating materials.Fleece-lined leggings will be your best friend, as will wool socks and a down vest. If you’ll be camping or sleeping in a camper van on your travels, splurge a little on a quality thermal sleeping bag. Reykjavik is Cool (No, REALLY)If you plan on spending any significant period of time in Iceland’s capital, you should know beforehand that it’s teeming with chic people dressed in super trendy clothes.Of course comfort and warmth always comes before style, and you’ll probably have a suitcase filled to the brim with bulky outdoor apparel. But if you’re looking for an excuse to break out a cute pair of heeled boots — or a fashion-forward dress in the mild summer months — Reykjavik is the place to do it. Get Local Currency at the AirportThere’s really no need to bring the local currency, Icelandic króna, with you beforehand. You will likely be able to use your credit/debit card for almost everything, though you can obtain króna at the airport for a little cash on hand. Keep in mind that some gas stations require you have a debit card with PIN, but otherwise just using a credit card will be sufficient for everyday spending. Read More:A Guide to Traveling Iceland in a Campervan6-Day Iceland Road Trip ItineraryThe Best Places to Visit in Iceland – What to Do & Where to Go8 Incredibly Safe Island Destinations for Solo TravelersThe Best Photography Locations in Southern IcelandHow to Travel Expensive Countries Affordably15 Best Weekend Getaways in Europe (And Where to Stay!)The Best Carry-On Luggage for Every BudgetHow to Choose the Best Shoes for Travel"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/iceland-campervan-travel-tips,A Guide to Traveling Iceland in a Campervan – Need to Know Tips!,Iceland,"The struggle of traveling Iceland: wanting to see farther than a hotel balcony view, but not quite willing to commit to the challenges of braving wind and cold in a tent. The best solution? Campervan travel!With four wheels and limitless freedom, we found our chosen mode of transportation (and accommodation) the most practical, comfortable, and convenient way to see the raw beauty this country has to offer. This must-read guide covers everything you need to know before renting a campervan in Iceland! Table of ContentsA Guide to Traveling Iceland in a CampervanRent from a Reputable CompanyManual or Automatic?What To BringSuitcase vs. Backpack?InsuranceCamping FeesMealsHygieneOther TipsA Guide to Traveling Iceland in a Campervan Rent from a Reputable CompanyA critical first step in planning your campervan travels through Iceland is choosing a rental company. We booked with Happy Campers and found their service and vans to be top notch. If you’re looking for an honest and reputable family-owned company, I cannot recommend them enough. We felt well taken care of and I wouldn’t hesitate to rent with them again.If you plan to travel about Iceland during peak tourist season in summer months, be sure to plan well in advance and book your campervan at least a few months before your trip; if you don’t, you may end up finding most companies (especially the highly rated ones) booked up and having to settle for a sub-par rental. Prices can range from $110-150 USD in the low season (before June/after early-September) up to $225-280 in high season.Manual or Automatic?Most rental cars in Iceland are manual. If you absolutely cannot drive a stick, be prepared to pay a premium and book far in advance. Also consider the terrain when deciding — most roads, even when they begin paved — turn into rough gravel. What To BringResearch which items are included in your campervan rental; most rental websites will include them in the van’s listing. Most campervan companies offer sleeping bag rentals if you don’t want to pack your own. The sleeping bags and blankets in our Happy Campers van kept us warm throughout the night.We also rented chairs from Happy Campers, but found this to be unnecessary because it was either too cold or too windy to comfortably sit outside. Sitting inside the van with the windows open was how we ate most of our meals.Waterproof shoes are essential, otherwise you’ll find hikes in wet conditions or on damp trails will leave your feet soaked and freezing. Pack “light,” but pack warm; bulky warm layers will take up lots of space, so bring fewer and warmer articles of clothing and do laundry at campsites. You’ll also want to bring a rechargeable battery pack with multiple ports to charge your electronics on the go.Suitcase vs. Backpack?Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					If you can comfortably fit all of your gear in a large backpack, that’s the easiest. Suitcases are doable, as long as they are not gigantic. Whatever you choose to bring with you, be prepared to move them onto the front seat every night. We brought two of the medium-sized suitcases in this luggage set. InsuranceThere’s so many options for insurance in Iceland that we actually felt a little overwhelmed (we mistakenly had not researched it beforehand).Happy Campers includes CDW with all of their rentals; this is a mandatory insurance in Iceland, so it should technically be included with any and all rentals. Just accepting the Collision Damage Waiver will limit your liability to 2500 EUR ($2,800 USD), although you can choose to purchase more extensive insurance packages that cover common damages the car may incur during your travels.I’d personally recommend at least getting gravel insurance since nearly every road will have gravel that will kick back at your car and may leave cosmetic blemishes. For more in-depth information on different types of insurance, see Happy Camper’s Insurance Q & A here.If you have a credit card that offers auto insurance, check with them before you leave. This will be your cheapest option, and you may even have discount options available to you for already having CDW provided! Camping FeesCamping outside of the designated campgrounds is now illegal, and one thing we didn’t take into consideration is the cost of camping fees. Be prepared for average camping fee charges of 1000 ISK ($10US) to 2000 ISK ($20 US) per person, per night; showers are not always included in this price, and can run an additional 200-500 ISK ($2-$5 USD) for 3-5 minutes. MealsYour van should come equipped with the necessary utensils to cook your own food, and you should plan to do so for the majority of your trip. You should grocery shop the day you arrive in Reykjavik, as there are really only 3 reliable places to get groceries in Iceland: Reykjavik, Akureyri and Selfoss.We had a small refrigerator which limited our options for meat and dairy products, although most fruits and veggies are fine to be left out. Our meals were simple — mostly consisting of salads, sandwiches, Muesli with bananas, and pasta.In total, we spent about $100 US at the grocery store and that lasted about 7 days for two people so plan accordingly! I would suggest meal planning before hitting the grocery store to save money and keep your food organized. HygieneVan-camping doesn’t mean throwing all hygiene out the window; in fact, bathing is possible every day!Most campgrounds have showers, although they are not always included in the price. Otherwise, you can visit one of the heated pools located in nearly every city where showers are not only recommended, but required before you swim. Bring biodegradable body wipes and dry shampoo for those times when you don’t have access to a shower or just want to freshen up. Other TipsFill up on gas early and often. Be forewarned that gas is outrageously expensive, but balances out the cost of not needing to pay standard hotel room rates every night.Don’t rely on your travel-perk credit card for everything and bring a debit card. Some gas stations require credit cards with pins.Just like gas, booze and beer is pricey throughout the entire country. Stock up on alcohol at the duty free shop in the airport when you arrive, or you’ll pay nearly 3x more at restaurants or elsewhere.Keep some coins on hand for bathrooms and showers (some do accept cards, but not all).Drink the tap water! The ice-cold fresh water from the glaciers is pure enough to fill your water bottle from or drink straight from the waterfalls.To see our full itinerary and suggestions on where to camp, visit our 6-Day Iceland Road Trip Itinerary post! Read More:8 Incredibly Safe Island Destinations for Solo TravelersHow to Travel Expensive Countries AffordablyHow to Choose the Best Shoes for TravelThe Best Places to Visit in IcelandHow to Choose the Best Camera for TravelThe Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel PhotographersThe Best Photography Locations in Southern Iceland6 Must-See National Parks in The Western United StatesHow to Choose the Best Luggage for Your Next Trip Pin it!"

We’ve covered all of the must-see sights in an easy-to-follow 6-day Iceland road trip itinerary!Most people want to drive the entire Ring Road during a trip to Iceland. While you could technically drive the Ring Road in 6 days, you’d be spending most of your time behind the wheel instead of exploring the outdoors!  Table of Contents6-Day Iceland Road Trip Itinerary – Guide to Planning Your Trip Check The Weather Report First!Day of ArrivalDay 1: The Golden CircleDay 2: Seljalandsfoss to VikDay 3: Vik to JökulsárlónDay 4 & 5: Skaftafell to Snæfellsnes PeninsulaDay 6: Snæfellsnes to Reykjavík Know Before You GoIceland Packing Essentials6-Day Iceland Road Trip Itinerary – Guide to Planning Your Trip We spent a lot of time hiking and taking photos, so we spread this itinerary out over 6 full days. If you’re short on time, it can easily be done in 5 days. I would, however, recommend giving yourself at least 6 days if you are visiting Iceland during the winter because the days are shorter and road conditions can be unpredictable.  Check The Weather Report First!I cannot stress this enough. Check the weather report once you arrive in Iceland to determine which direction to head first! If there’s a particular spot you absolutely want to see, plan your route based on the weather.The roads were closed in the south of the island during a large portion of our trip and we were forced to cut that part of our itinerary short in order to avoid getting stuck driving all the way around the island with very limited time. You either have to wait out the storm (in our case it was 3 days) or you have to drive all the way around the island to get back to Reykjavík.The road in the south of Iceland — from about Selfoss to Jökulsárlón — has very little protection from the elements, so a windstorm can wreak havoc on this area. They do close this road in extremely high winds for the safety of drivers. Day of ArrivalThe day we arrived, we picked up our Happy Campers campervan and spent the night in an AirBnb in Reykjavík to shower and get a full night’s rest. This isn’t completely necessary if you already have a campervan, but it’s well worth your sanity before you embark on your road trip.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					A slightly cheaper option would be to stay at a campground in Reykjavík that has showers available. We found an AirBnb for about $100 USD so we felt our comfort was worth a little extra money.Besides showering and getting some sleep, you’ll want to grab some groceries for the week. Reykjavík has the largest selection of grocery stores in Iceland. You’ll have more food options and the ability to get a few things cheaper than if you were to pick up items at gas stations or restaurants along the way.If you book with Happy Campers, they have an awesome “Free Zone” where other travelers have left the food items they didn’t use. We picked up some items here before heading to the store! Day 1: The Golden CircleHighlights on the Golden Circle: Þingvellir National Park, Geysers at Haukadalur, Gullfoss Waterfall, Kerið Crater Lake, Icelandic horsesThe Golden Circle is an easy drive from Reykjavík and this route can either be done at the beginning or the end of your trip. You can spend anywhere from 4-8 hours on this route — depending on how often you stop for photos. Where to stay near the Golden Circle: If you get an early start, you should have enough time to head to either Selfoss or Seljalandsfoss Waterfall. The best spot for camping in this area is Hamragardar Campground which overlooks Seljalandsfoss Waterfall. For hotels, I recommend Arctic Nature Hotel or Guesthouse Garun Skolaveller in Selfoss. Day 2: Seljalandsfoss to VikHighlights: Seljalandsfoss Waterfall, Gljúfrabúi Waterfall, Sólheimasandur Airplane Wreck, Skogafoss Waterfall, VikI recommend taking the morning to explore Seljalandsfoss and Gljúfrabúi Waterfall (hidden waterfall right next to Seljalandsfoss). From here, Skogafoss is just a short drive away, but plan to spend a few hours here if you want to hike to the top of the falls.Next up is the 4 mile (round trip) hike to Sólheimasandur Airplane Wreck. Keep in mind that this excursion will take up a good portion of your day. Depending on how much time you have left in your day, you can either drive back and camp at Skogafoss (recommended!) or head to Vik for the night. Where to stay: We camped at Skogafoss waterfall and it was probably our favorite campsite of the entire trip! Otherwise, there’s plenty of accommodation choices in Vik: Vik Camping, Thakgil, Nausthamar Apartment, Hotel Katla Hofdabrekka and Icelandair Hotel Vik. Day 3: Vik to JökulsárlónHighlights: Vik’s Black Sand Beach, Reynishverfi Basalt Column Beach, Fjadrargljufur Canyon, Skaftafell National Park, Jökulsárlón (Glacier Lagoon), Dryholaey PeninsulaIf  you didn’t have time to explore Vik the day before, I recommend stopping at the Black Sand Beach and Reynishverfi Basalt Column Beach. From here, head east towards the Glacier Lagoon! Depending on how much time you have, you can take a detour to the Dryholaey peninsula, Fjadrargljufur canyon, and stop for a quick hike to a glacier at Skaftafell National Park.But let’s be honest, Jökulsárlón really steals the show in this part of Iceland, so make sure to give yourself enough time to explore here. Where to stay: We stayed at Skaftafell campground because it’s only about a 45 minute drive from the lagoon. If you want to stay even closer to the lagoon, Skyrhúsid Guest House and Hali Country Hotel are less than 10 minutes away! Day 4 & 5: Skaftafell to Snæfellsnes PeninsulaHighlights on Snæfellsnes Peninsula: Kirkjufell Mountain, Kirkjufellsfoss Waterfall, Snæfellsjökull National Park, Snæfellsjökull glacier, Gerðuberg Columnar Basalt, Ölkelda Mineral Spring, Búðir Church, Rauðfeldsgjá GorgeOn day 4, we made the drive back towards Reykjavík, towards Snaefellsnes peninsula. The drive takes about 6 hours, so you might prefer to break this up into 2 days, hit up all the spots you missed from Day 3, and stay the night around Selfoss. On Day 5, I recommend spending the entire day exploring Snaefellsnes peninsula. Where to stay on Snæfellsnes Peninsula: Grundarfjörður Campground is only about a 5-minute drive from Kirkjufellsfoss Waterfall. In the same town, both Hellnafell Apartments (with a view of Kirkjufell mountain) and Hotel Framnes (with views of the fjord) get excellent reviews.Fjadrargljufur Canyon Day 6: Snæfellsnes to ReykjavíkHighlights: Blue Lagoon, Hvalfjörður, Hallgrímskirkja ChurchOn our last day, we headed to Bjarteyjarsandur farm in Hvalfjörður because we happened to be visiting in May when it’s lambing season! I’m obsessed with adorable lambs so this was a dream come true for me. Once we arrived back to Reykjavík, we stopped at Sundhöllin pool — the oldest pool in Reykjavík — for a shower and a soak.Our flight didn’t leave until 5pm the next day, so we saved our Blue Lagoon visit for the morning before our flight departed. This is recommended by almost everyone who plans to visit the Blue Lagoon because it’s closer to the airport than Reykjavík. Where to stay: Camp at Reykjavík Campsite or book an Airbnb for your last night. (If you sign up through our link, you’ll get $40 off your first stay!)  Know Before You GoGetting There: If you’re coming from the West Coast, like we did, WOW air now offers direct flights from Los Angeles! This was our first time flying with this budget airline and we were both impressed with the legroom, seat comfort, and the staff. You can also fly direct from San Francisco, Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. With flights starting at US $99 each way, it’s a steal!Blue Lagoon: While planning your Iceland trip, remember that pre-booking your time slot at the Blue Lagoon is required!&nbsp;It is recommended to plan your Blue Lagoon trip either right when you arrive in Iceland or right before you depart because it’s only 20 minutes from the airport – versus 1 hour from Reykjavík. Iceland Packing Essentials Wet Wipes: I recommend bringing biodegradable wet wipes even if you’re not camping around Iceland. It’s great to have these to clean your hands or wipe up messes in the car. If you are camping, these are a must to freshen up! I always recommend buying biodegradable wipes, like the ones mentioned above, because some wipes are harmful to the environment. Clothing: Bring multiple base layers!! I only had one good base layer, so I had to wash it halfway through my trip. Even in the summer, you’ll want a moisture-wicking base layer to keep you warm and eliminating sweaty clothes when hiking. Base layers also take up less room and packing light will make your trip much more enjoyable – especially if you are spending your whole trip in a campervan! Portable Battery Charger: Portable battery chargers are a must for road trips to charge your devices! This charger is one of the smallest and lightest on the market. Waterproof Gear: Iceland’s weather is extremely unpredictable, but one thing you can count on is some rain during your trip. Always bring a waterproof jacket, waterproof hiking boots or waterproof boots, and waterproof pants. Also, don’t forget a rain cover for your backpack! Hat & Gloves: Bring at least one warm hat and a pair of thick warm gloves no matter what time of year you visit. Check out our Iceland Road Trip video below and don’t forget to subscribe to our YouTube Channel! Read More:The Best Places to Visit in Iceland – What to Do & Where to Go10 Important Safety Tips for Solo Female TravelersThe Best Photography Locations in Southern IcelandWhat to Pack for a Trip to IcelandHow to Choose the Best Travel CameraThe Ultimate Road Trip Packing List (Must-Have Essentials!)A Guide to Traveling Iceland in a Campervan – Need to Know Tips!15 Best Weekend Getaways in Europe (And Where to Stay!) Pin it! "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/off-road-driving-destinations-around-the-world,Tips For Off-Road Driving Around the World,Iceland," Tips For Off-Road Driving Around the World Off road driving isn’t only taking America by storm, it’s kindling the interest of Western Europe. There are a number of off road clubs in Ireland and Great Britain, offering classes in off road safety, as well as rugged obstacle courses that include mud bogging, river forging and rock crawling. However, you’ll discover quickly that most of these courses are privately owned and operated.Western Europe does not encourage driving off the main roads or making your own Jeep or off-road vehicle tracks. However, it does offer guide services in Italy, France, Spain and Switzerland.There is a spectacular off road track with a starting point in Calais, France, that heads south, into the French Alps, with incredible mountain vistas and scenery.From France into Italy, you’ll follow an ancient trade route on a winding trail that brings you through quaint Italian villages and climbs to breathless heights, where the sharp snowcapped peaks of the Alps frame deep valleys and golden meadows. You can visit a 10,000 foot glacier or visit one of the forts of Mussolini. Final destination point is Mont Blanc, and its famous 170 mile walking trail winding through the high altitudes of Switzerland. Off-Roading Tips for EuropeIf you choose to off road drive on your own, there are some rules you need to go by if you don’t want to run into trouble with the law. Stay off all posted property. They are very strict about trespassing and will even hunt down wayward Jeeps and 4X4’s. Swamps, dunes, coast lines and national parks are off limits.All other tracks you are allowed to drive, if you don’t damage them. This can even mean driving a track while it’s wet and leaving mud prints. Stay out of forests as much as possible. Most of the forests are hunting reserves or are privately owned.Drive slowly and in small groups. Do not throw any litter out the windows, not even cigarettes. Unless you’re absolutely sure it’s official, do not attempt any water crossings. There are many exciting places to visit in Europe, but for a safe off-road experience, it’s probably best to contact private off-road clubs. India – Let’s Get CrazyIf Europe’s rules seem too rigid, maybe you’d prefer a place where driving rules don’t seem to exist at all. When you are in India, what side of the road do you drive on? The answer is, any side you don’t see an oncoming car.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Indian drivers apparently like to begin their trips in the middle of the road. They move to one side only after a little breathless chicken on the road game playing, and you have to watch sharp to decide which side they’ll take. It’s recommended you leave your headlights on at all times, day and night, as Indian drivers don’t seem to see you otherwise.The large majority of the roads going out of the cities could be technically called off-roads, because few are paved, and even fewer are maintained. Obstacles in the road could include rocks left after a truck spun to the side and their tires hurled a collection of stones into the road, crossing or idling cattle, or a person sleeping at the side of the road.During the monsoon season, the roads are often flooded, with giant mud puddles to slosh around in and shallow flood run-offs. In the dry season, you’ll find patches where farmers have left their grain to dry in the road.You’re expected to just drive around them, so if you don’t have a high riding suspension system, it could get a bit risky driving the road at all. Sometimes, you’ll find giant holes that someone dug into the road for no apparent reason, but it does make an interesting obstacle course. If they have very little concern about the proper use of roads, at least you’ll find the people of India warm, friendly and as curious about you as you are about them. Iceland – How Green the ValleyWe all know the little joke about how Iceland avoided becoming over-populated by stating they lived in a land of ice, whereas if you keep traveling west, you’ll find the country of Greenland. It was a great diversion tactic that sent early explorers merrily on their way to discovering a true land of ice and eventually, a northern route to North America.Iceland does have an extreme climate; rainy, mid-range temperature in the summers and below zero weather in the winter, but it is probably one of the most incredibly beautiful places on earth. It’s a land of volcanoes, fjords, glaciers, icebergs, deep ravines, and cliffs that drop straight down as a solid wall into the sea. The off-road driving is among the best, with a rugged terrain of heaving boulders, jagged mountains, and valleys so green, you can only pause to gaze in wonder.The island has an extremely low population, just three hundred twenty thousand, and the largest percent of that population is located in the town of Reykjavik, with 198,000 inhabitants. Most of the countryside is very wild and very rural, with white water rapids, crystal clear lakes and dazzling waterfalls.Accommodations range from hotels, to overnight stays in farm houses to camping out on your own. The language is Icelandic, but English is a widely spoken language.Do they like four wheel drives? Do they like Jeeps? You bet they do! Iceland has its own extreme formula driving course where the motor sport competition demonstrate their no fear philosophy by doing flying leaps over rocky gullies, spinning with break neck abandon over lava beds, race through mud and water, and do dare devil antics on narrow tracks that cut vertically straight through the walls of dirt and gravel ridges.If you’re hungering for extreme driving, Iceland is the place to go but be warned. Timidity is not a word in their off road driving vocabulary. Magical MexicoTake away the political tension, and Mexico is one of the most charming and beautiful places you could ever hope to visit. Most of the roads have a bit of a skin tingling feel to them, especially if you are in a mountainous area like Durango or Morelia, but nothing sends the goose bumps running like the State of Oaxaca.Oaxaca is spectacular with ancient Mayan and Aztec ruins, and getting to them can be a bit of a high jitter ride. Oaxaca City lies tranquil, in a sweet tropical valley, with rain forest Mountains rising up behind it. The roads centered around Oaxaca are primarily paved, but if you aim your Jeep at Hautla, it’s a whole different story.Hautla is high in the mountains, on a very narrow road, mostly unpaved. During the rain season, it is covered with pot holes, sliding rocks, and soft sides that bog down immediately if one wheel should slip off the track. There are times, as you round a steep corner, you’ll feel the urge to do what so many of the local people do when navigating the bends, the dips and harrowing passages on this primitive rout; genuflect and send up a little prayer of thanks when you’ve made it to the next spot that isn’t clinging to the edge of a hundred foot drop safely.The people of Oaxaca are generally friendly, although you do have to watch for marauders in the small towns. You must keep an eye on your possessions at all times and have plenty of bug spray.It’s best to use the buddy system of at least two Jeeps, and secure a trust-worthy guide in Oaxaca City before attempting your adventure. If you get stuck on the side of the road, which happens easily as this is very serious rain forest with a very primitive road, there’s little chance the inhabitants of the tiny villages will help you.If you don’t have a buddy vehicle and don’t have a winch, you’ll either have to figure out how to get out of the ditch by yourself or wait for assistance from the next approaching vehicle. In the meantime, the village inhabitants will bring out the chairs, offer soda pop and native foods for sale, and watch the spectacle leisurely as you labor to free yourself from the ditch.Very few people within the state of Oaxaca speak English, even in Oaxaca City, unless you remain in a tourist oriented destination. Spanish is the primary spoken language, with a variety of indigenous dialects.It’s an extremely varied and beautiful region, and one of the most amazing off-road experiences, where the ancient collide with the modern, the forests run into deep lagoons, high desert plateaus bask in the sun, and the people, living in the shadows of moldering pyramids and temples, believe in magic. Photo Credits: indigoprime, Andrea Schaffer"

I mean, there are 20 regions in the country, each with their own distinct cultures and attractions, so how are you supposed to choose just a few for your upcoming trip?I’ve had the pleasure of visiting Italy five times now, and each time I’ve been even more stunned by the diversity, scenery, and art than the time before. I’ve explored the towns of Lake Como, hiked through Cinque Terre, traveled solo through Bologna, and saw the sites in Rome. I’ve booked pasta making classes, I’ve taken guided tours, and I’ve hung with the locals, among so much else.Through all of this experience, I can honestly say that there is something in Italy for everyone — no matter what your interests or budget — and we’ve partnered with Klook to give you some of our favorite experiences. Whether you want to travel solo in Lake Como or take a tour through the sites of Rome, there is an option for you! Table of Contents20 Best Things To Do in ItalyTake a Gondola Ride in VeniceTake a Cooking ClassGo Skiing in the DolomitesTake a Gelato Making ClassVisit the Duomo in MilanTour the Villages of Cinque TerreTour the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Palatine HillTake a Walking Tour in MateraMuseum Hop in FlorenceHike Mount VesuviusRoad Trip the Amalfi CoastVisit the Leaning Tower of PisaTour the VaticanVisit the Ruins of PompeiiRelax on Lake ComoVisit the Valley of the TemplesTake a Wine TourGo Under the Trevi Fountain in RomeTake a Food Tour in BolognaExplore the Frasassi CavesPlan Your Trip to Italy20 Best Things To Do in Italy Take a Gondola Ride in VeniceWhether you’re traveling solo, with your family, or on a romantic holiday with your significant other, taking a Gondola Ride in Venice is an activity not to be missed.Gondolas can be found in the main tourist areas, but if you want to save money and avoid the hassle of negotiating a price, then booking a tour in advance is the way to go.That said, Venice is a city consisting of 120 islands built over an ancient lagoon, so if taking a Gondola isn’t a priority or out of your budget range, then there are plenty of other opportunities to get out on the water. Also popular is the vaporetto (public ferry), the traghetto (gondola ferry), and the taxi acqueo (water taxi). Take a Cooking ClassJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Let’s be real, a huge reason why you’re planning a trip to Italy is for the food — so why not learn to make some Italian specialties while you’re there?I once took a pasta making course in Chiusi Chianciano Terme and had a blast learning all about it from the pros. Our teachers were so much fun and I took home a valuable skill.Of course, you don’t just have to stick to pasta, as there are pizza workshops, bread baking workshops, and so much else all across the country. Go Skiing in the DolomitesA region that has been getting a lot of buzz lately, the Dolomites are a mountain range in Northeastern Italy that stretches across the Italian Provinces of Trentino and Alto Adige.The Dolomites are widely renowned as a winter destination, as there is amazing downhill skiing, snowboarding, chalets, and thermal baths to indulge in, but don’t skip out on summer here too.

Construction began in 1386 and took six full centuries to complete (although it’s said that the Duomo is still not completed).There are six areas of the Duomo to explore – the rooftops, the inside, the archaeological area, the San Gottardo Church, the Duomo Museum, and the Crypt of Saint Charles.Keep in mind that tickets for the Duomo must be purchased in advance. Tour the Villages of Cinque TerreLocated on the coastline of the Italian Riviera, Cinque Terre (the Five Villages) is famous for being one of the most picturesque areas of the country, and that’s saying something.Comprised of five villages – Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso – Cinque Terre is characterized by rainbow-colored buildings, steep craggy cliffs, beautiful terraced farms, and amazing views of the ocean.The towns of Cinque Terre are all linked by ferries, hiking trails, and a train, although you can easily road trip this part of Italy as well — just keep in mind that some of the downtown areas are car-free.

Here, gladiators would fight to the death in brutal games, exotic animals would be put on display, and public executions would be held regularly. Today, it’s perhaps Rome’s most iconic site.Meanwhile, the nearby Roman Forum was the site of several ancient Roman government buildings, and Palatine Hill was one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Rome, having housed emperors and dignitaries.Visiting these three sites in a day is easily done, as they’re all located within the same archaeological area and you can walk between them. Plus, there are guided tours that will let you skip the lines! Take a Walking Tour in MateraA town located in Basilicata, a Southeast Region of Italy, Matera is known for its ancient cave houses that residents were living in as recently as 1950.The town is a maze of palaces, churches, and architecture old and new. To get the most out of your trip, a Matera guided tour is the way to go. Prepare to spend a lot of time learning about the history of Matera and all that it has become today. Museum Hop in FlorenceFlorence is well regarded as one of the world’s great capitals of art, so dedicating time to the exquisite museums and galleries in the city is a must.There are endless museums and galleries in the Tuscan capital, but some of the best are the Uffizi Gallery (home to The Birth of Venus and Primavera), the Duomo, and the Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze.

You can hike it!Hiking Mount Vesuvius will take roughly a half-hour each way, and it’s a relatively steep hike with lots of switchbacks. So, while it won’t take long to reach the crater, it’s good to be prepared with grippy shoes and a lot of water.Oh, and yes, hiking Mount Vesuvius is totally safe. While it’s estimated that the volcano has erupted 40 times in the past 2000 years, the volcano gives warning signs of an eruption at least two weeks in advance, and you can bet that hikers won’t be allowed to casually wander up there when that happens. Road Trip the Amalfi CoastWith terraced orchards, vineyards, over 100 beaches, and incredible views of the ocean below, the Amalfi Coast is on the bucket list of many.With a distinctly Mediterranean vibe, the Amalfi Coast is located in the province of Salerno in Southern Italy and draws in roughly 5 million visitors each year. That said, it’s totally worth braving the crowds and taking a road trip along this region.The road along the Amalfi Coast is also known as the Blue Highway, which runs 69 kilometers and links up the seaside towns. Yet, while the drive doesn’t take long, I highly recommend making multiple stops along the way and checking out all the beautiful towns.While on the Amalfi Coast, hike the Path of the Gods, visit the Valle Dei Mulini, swoon at the pastel-colored houses of Positano, and wander the town of Sorrento. Visit the Leaning Tower of PisaAh, the tower that has inspired one of the most famous tourist poses of all time.Standing at 60 meters tall, the Leaning Tower of Pisa began construction in 1173 and was pretty much leaning right from the start, although it was designed to be vertical.While it may seem like a touristy place to go, the tower and the surrounding buildings are iconic to Italy, and you won’t want to miss taking a wander through the town of Pisa after you check out the site. To make the experience go as smoothly as possible, I recommend booking a Pisa Cathedral guided tour. Tour the VaticanAlthough technically it’s own country, the Vatican is located right in Rome and is one of the most iconic sites in this area of the world. Even if you’re not Roman Catholic, the Vatican is beautiful to see and has a ton of history attached to it.You won’t want to miss checking out Saint Peter’s Basilica, Saint Peter’s Square, the Sistine Chapel, Saint Peter’s tomb, and Castel Sant’Angelo. Visit the Ruins of PompeiiAs I mentioned above, Pompeii was an ancient Roman city located near Naples that was destroyed by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79AD.When the volcano erupted, Pompeii was covered by a thick layer of volcanic ash and remained that way until 1748, when it was rediscovered almost completely intact by explorers.Since its discovery, Pompeii has attracted 2.5 million visitors a year and is easily one of the nation’s top sites.While there, be sure to visit the Temple of Apollo, the House of the Faun, the Amphitheatre of Pompeii, and the Temple of Jupiter – among others. Relax on Lake ComoLocated in Northern Italy at the base of the Alps, Lake Como has been called the most beautiful lake in the world and is known for its picturesque villages, luxury properties, amazing hikes, and water activities.While it was once known as a vacation retreat for the rich and famous, you can visit Lake Como and take in its wonders on pretty much any budget. Some of the best towns to visit on Lake Como include Varenna, Bellagio, Como, Tremezzo, and Brunate.

These include Hera Temple (aka Juno Temple), Temple of the Dioscuri, Temple of Concordia, Temple of Heracles, Temple of Olympian Zeus, Temple of Hephaestus, Temple of Asclepius, and Temple of Demeter. Take a Wine TourItaly is a place of pilgrimage for any serious wine connoisseur, and with so many regions and variances, there is a lot of wine knowledge here to uncover.Some of the best Italian wine regions include Puglia, Sicily, Prosecco, Trentino, Collio Friulano, Tuscany, Umbria, and Irpinia. Go Under the Trevi Fountain in RomeYes, the Trevi Fountain is one of the most famous sites in all of Italy, but did you know that there is a whole complex of ancient ruins right below?Dating back to the Imperial Age, the ruins – also known as La Citta dell’Acqua (City of Water) — can be found just around the corner from the fountain. You can visit either independently or call ahead for a guided tour.

So, if Italian cuisine is calling your name, then take a food tour in Bologna!Discover melt-in-your-mouth meats, savory cheeses, and some unique-to-Bologna kinds of pasta. Explore the Frasassi CavesThe Frasassi Caves, located in Genga, Italy, is an immense cave system filled with huge caverns, stalactites, and stalagmites.Visits can only be arranged through guided tours, but the highlights include a crystallized lake, a Grand Canyon, and the Ancona Abyss, among others. In fact, it has been said that journeying through the caves feels like you’re descending into the center of the Earth.In total, tours through the caves take about an hour and a half, so prepare for a long trek and bring good shoes! Plan Your Trip to ItalyAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

To make the land around Corniglia productive for farming and maintaining olive groves, they carved the steep hillside into rugged, yet farmable, terraces; resulting in a most unique landscape that is as unique as it is hikeable.Keep in mind that because Corniglia is situated up atop the cliffs, there is a bit of a hike to get to the village — about 365 steps worth. The views from these steps are phenomenal, but if you have luggage or are in need of a more accessible way up, there is a bus that runs from the train station right into the center of the village.  Where to Stay in CornigliaFor great budget accommodation in Corniglia, consider Casa Orietta Apartments.For a mid-range option, consider Camere Nunzio Guest Houses.For a more luxury stay, try out Affittacamere Le Terrazze.

While the festival has no exact date, every year Vernazza is invaded by a percussion group known as “Batebalengo”, the members of which are dressed like pirates.

The larger beaches are located on the Fegina side of the village, and here you’ll find soft sand and pebbles, beach loungers, bars, umbrellas, and restaurants. Keep in mind that most of the beaches here are privately owned, so you’ll have to pay a fee to use the chairs.  Corniglia BeachesA beach located in a little cove, Corniglia Beach isn’t the softest of sand, but it does have water access and is beautiful in its own right. The beach at Corniglia is somewhat of a hike to get to, and so chances are there won’t be a huge crowd when you arrive. To get to Corniglia Beach, find the signs for the Marina in the village, take a short walk down the hill, and you’ll come to a cove with crystal-clear waters.If you’re looking for something a little different, then check out the other beach near Corniglia — Guvano Beach. Guvano Beach isn’t only a sandy beach in Corniglia, but it’s also the only nudist beach in the area.Guvano Beach isn’t the easiest to get to, but if you walk down the Lardarina Staircase in Corniglia, and turn right at the bottom, you’ll eventually come to a sketchy-looking railway tunnel. Walk down this pitch-black tunnel for about a half-mile and voila, you’ve reached the sandy beach and azure waters at Guvano!  Levanto BeachesThe beaches at Levanto are the second-largest in the Cinque Terre and yet are generally less crowded than the ones at Monterosso. The beaches along the coast come in both sandy and pebbly versions, but have easy water access and are great for an afternoon of lounging.To get to the beach at Levanto, go to the Levanto train station and then take a short walk just ten minutes to shore.  Riomaggiore BeachesJust around the corner from Riomaggiore’s Marina, you’ll find the village’s little beach called La Fossola. This rocky beach isn’t the most comfortable to lounge on, but what it lacks in soft sand it makes up for in water access. Summers in Riomaggiore can get really hot, so if you’re willing to brave traversing the craggy shoreline to cool off in the Ligurian Sea, then this beach is for you!Just keep in mind that the rocks aren’t the easiest to walk on, so bring good shoes.  Cinque Terre Packing Essentials  Hiking Gear: As hiking is a popular activity in Cinque Terre, proper hiking shoes or boots, hiking socks, and even a hiking pole for those steep slopes are recommended. Sun Protection: Spending time out in the sun is pretty much a given in Cinque Terre, so make sure to pack some sunglasses and sunscreen. Comfortable, Style-Forward Clothing: Italy is a very fashion-forward country, but in a place as outdoorsy as Cinque Terre, you’re also going to want to also be as comfortable as possible.A pair of comfortable flats are perfect for walking around town, breezy summer dresses will be sure to keep you looking and feeling cool, a pashmina is great for covering up at religious sites, and a cross-body bag will keep your belongings safe. Swim Gear: If you plan on spending any time on the beach, then a swimsuit, quick-drying towel, sarong, and pair of water-shoes should be on your packing list.  Plan Your Trip to Cinque TerreAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/things-to-do-in-japan-travel-tips,Japan Travel Tips: Everything You Need to Know,Japan,"Welcome to the Around the World Interview series on Ordinary Traveler! Every couple of weeks we will have a new guest who has either lived or spent an extended amount of time in a particular country. Each guest will give valuable insights and tips to a different destination around the world.This week, Lash from Lash World Tour shares her Japan travel tips! Japan Travel Tips: Everything You Need to Know How long did you travel in Japan?I left the USA in 1991 with my best friend, soon after university, specifically to move to Kyoto, Japan in order to work and save money to travel the world. I lived there for 6 years, until late 1997. I taught English plus a few other odd jobs. I had loads of free time since I only had to work 25 hours/week teaching for a full salary!So I completely immersed myself in traditional Japanese culture. I studied kimono wearing, tea ceremony, flower arrangement, aikido, taiko drumming, koto, and shiatsu massage. I performed taiko, koto and tea ceremony publicly several times.I attended as many traditional performances, festivals and tea ceremonies as possible. I continually explored Kyoto’s 2000+ temples, shrines and gardens plus all it’s old neighborhoods, hidden cuisine restaurants, and nearby mountain temples and onsen. I was fascinated and never lost my excitement.I traveled as much as possible around the country, visiting all four of Japan’s main islands: Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu. I cycled a lot of it, took loads of trains and several ferries. I visited about half of Honshu, cycled around Hokkaido, Awaji island and saw small parts of Kyushu and Shikoku. I also took a tropical vacation to the remote Okinawa island, Iriomote. I climbed the North Japan Alps, Mt Fuji, and Daisetsuzan NP in Hokkaido. I marched up dozens of mountaintop temples.So I guess the short answer is that I traveled extensively around Japan for a solid 6 years.I returned to Kyoto in 2001 for 3 months to sell imported goods from Bali and Thailand. I traveled all over Japan again to attend Trance Festivals and also sold stuff at several of Kyoto’s monthly temple festivals. I saw lots of new places in Japan on that trip. Budget tips for Japan?Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Japan is extremely expensive. Everything there is expensive, including accommodation, food, transportation, clothes, toiletries and personal goods. So my first tip is to take everything you’ll need with you from your home country. Try to avoid buying stuff in Japan- except souvenirs. Another idea is to take a shorter trip. AccommodationThe cheapest accommodation you’re going to find is at minshuku (like hostels) and capsule hotels (only for men). Lowest prices in 1990s were 3000-5000 Y per person / $30-50 US. It will cost more for westerners now with the Yen at 79Y/ $1. and I don’t know current prices at the minshuku and capsule hotels. Prices could be the same or higher. Matt Kepnes reported 2500Y, but I never heard of that in the 1990s. Perhaps more guest houses or western style hostels have opened since I was living there?If you’re on a budget, try to find free accommodation via Couch Surfing, Tripping, or other hosting/traveler services. EatingIf you can live on (udon or soba) noodle soup or ‘rice bowls’ (bowls of rice with meat on top, that’s the cheapest way to go. 400-800Y / bowl. About $5 US, minimum. In Japan, 7-11s have an excellent variety of great healthy food and meals!There are ‘rice balls’ onigiri, (actually triangles) filled with bits of veg or fish. There are fully wrapped take out meals. If you can cook at a minshuku or person’s house, buying groceries and cooking is slightly cheaper than eating out. AT most restaurants, meals generally cost 800Y and up / $10 US. TransportationTransportation is so expensive in Japan that companies pay for their employees monthly transportation passes! I think my train pass cost $300 US/month! I was sure happy my school paid it! Some tips to save moneyDon’t travel around Japan too much. Just pick one or two areas, spend your time there, and minimize transportation.Cycle. Japan is one country where cycling can save you loads of money in transportation.Before going to Japan you can buy monthly and weekly train passes, for foreigners only, that will allow unlimited train travel. You can only buy them outside Japan and before arriving.During Japan’s 2 yearly school holidays, there are special train tickets for students called Ju-hatchi kippu. ’18 tickets’. They allow unlimited train rides for one day- 24 hours- on local trains. If you schedule your train connections accurately, you can travel travel between, say Kyoto and Tokyo, in one day on local trains. It’s a long, arduous process, but it saves a lot of money. One catch is that you have to buy a pack of tickets, I think 10, so it’s only worthwhile if you’re going to travel several days. Favorite places or favorite experiences?My best friend and I discovered Yoshino, a ridgetop village / tourist spot about 3 hours south of Kyoto by train. Yoshino is famous for cherry tree bark products, onsens and mountain temples. I’m not sure how we discovered it, but we returned a few times/year, mainly because we found a ryokan (Japanese Inn) with an onsen (hot baths) that allows day visitors to its onsen.Generally ryokans only allow overnight guests to use their onsen, so that was a great treat. Even better, they had a big cask of sake beside the baths and little square wood cups to drink it with. You could drink all the sake you wanted with your bath! In reality, you can’t drink much alcohol while bathing or you’ll get sick.We would take day trips to Yoshino in different seasons to hike in the forests, listen to conk horns blowing around the mountains, browse the lovely cherry bark shops, eat traditional food, and sit in the onsen drinking sake all afternoon.Eventually, we also made Yoshino an annual pilgrimage to celebrate our ‘anniversary of arriving in Japan.’ We would take turns paying for an overnight stay at our favorite Yoshino Ryokan. It became a very special spot for us. What is the food like in Japan?Oh, man, there is such an astounding variety of Japanese food that never reaches N America. In addition to a huge selection of year round, daily cuisines to chose from, there are also regional and seasonal foods. Most regions and cities in Japan are famous for one food or the other. Fall, winter, spring and summer each bring their own special cuisines, based on seasonally fresh produce and sea products.I could write a book explaining all of them (oh, that’s an idea!), so here I’ll just list a bunch which are especially delicious and perhaps a bit unknown. I’ll leave it to the readers to investigate what they are and where to get them:One great thing that makes eating in Japan easy: every restaurant has a display window full of realistic-looking plastic sample meals. You can see everything they serve. On the other hand, you might not understand what any of them are, since signs and prices are in Japanese! But you can point to order.Better known foods: sushi, sashimi, yakitori, yakiniku, miso soup,Lesser known foods: okonomiyake, udon, soba, donburi, saba, gyoza, o-cha-zake, umeshu, onigiri, yaki-imo, yaki-soba, yaki-udon, shabu-shabu, age-dashi-dofu, edamame, chawan-mushi, Japanese ‘curry’: kare ricu.If you can bear it, try the traditional Japanese breakfast of rice, grilled fish, miso soup, sour pickles an seaweed. Yummy! Probably will only find this at minshuku and ryokan.They make amazing dishes with more unusual vegetables (for westerners): eggplant, pumpkin, radishes, sweet potatoes. They also have an astounding variety of dishes made with miso and various soya products,including many kinds of tofu. It’s a great country for vegetarians.Japan also has astoundingly delicious bakeries full of a huge variety of breads, pastries, desserts. Mostly you won’t know what they are, but just try a few. Some are delicious, some very very odd.  Dos and don’ts regarding customs?Don’t point at people or touch their heads.Don’t eat in public, including on buses, subways and trains. Long-distance trains are entirely different. Passengers take boxed lunches and happily eat on board. A huge variety of take out meals are on sale at train stations.Don’t groom yourself in public, including combing your hair or cutting/filing your nails. Japanese will be appalled and very uncomfortable.There are lots and lots of complicated social etiquette and interpersonal customs. But Japanese don’t expect outsiders to understand them, so you’re basically off the hook.   Favorite place to stay in Japan?Yes, but none of them are cheap. While I was living and working there I could afford to occasionally visit some top end ryokan with onsen. They typically cost 18,000- 30,000 yen per PERSON, not per room. At 100 Y/ $1 Us, that was $180- $300 US in the 1990s. Now the yen is 79 Y/$1 US. If anyone’s interested, I can recommend a couple I’ve visited. Drop me a line.One of my favorite places I’ve EVER stayed in my life is at a temple complex at Koya San- Mt. Koya, which has a sprawling monastery/ temple complex on top of the mountain. They have rooms for guests in traditional wood buildings with tatami mats, painted sliding doors, and Japanese-style beds, and including elaborate dinners and breakfasts served in your room. It cost 5000 Y/ person. AT the time, $50 US, which was astoundingly cheap for Japan. At today’s rate ~ $60 US. Things to do in Japan? Must Do ActivitiesGo to a sento (public bath house)Go to an onsen, preferably in mountains, and preferably drinking sake froma square wood cup visit a castle, a temple, a royal palace see a tradtional performance- either Kabuki, Puppet or attend a tea ceremony and try whisked green tea and Japanese sweet cakes attend a festival in Kyoto experience a department store opening! Check out the department store food floor.Have someone put a kimono on cherry blossoms in may autumn leaves in September. Must see sitesKyoto -2000+ temples, shrines and gardens Safety tips, warnings or things to be aware of?Japan is an exceedingly safe country. That’s not to say there is no crime at all, but it’s almost exclusively tied to Yakuza activities or family/relative issues. I’ve never heard of any foreigner being targeted for any kind of crime. So in terms of safety and crime, nothing to warn you about Japan.Traffic is on the left, like the UK and Australia. If you’re from N America, be very very careful crossing the street and look LEFT first.Japanese are extremely punctual, like Germans, and appreciate the same in return. That also means all trains and buses run exactly on time. Don’t be late or you’ll definitely miss it! Best and cheapest times to visit Japan?There are no cheaper or more expensive seasons in Japan. It’s just evenly expensive year round.So you might want to plan your trip to Japan based on which weather seasons you prefer or else some special Japanese customs, festivals and events. Japan has a four season climate, like N America and Europe. Japanese tend to make even more out of differences in seasons by having special activities and foods.Especially busy travel seasons for Japanese domestically are New Year’s, end of April/early May between school years, July and August is school holidays, so masses of college students and high school students on school trips horde long distance trains and famous Japanese sites like Kyoto’s temples. AutumnAstounding change of leaves colors. In mid September in Kyoto, a bit earlier further north.In Kyoto, Jidai Matsuri (festival of ages) and great autumn cuisine Wintergreat skiiing in Japan Alps and Hokkaido, but avoid weekends!Amazing time to enjoy onsen and ryokan in mountains. Sit in a hot spring surrounded by snow, drinking sake!Seldom snows in Kyoto, but when it does it’s gorgeous.New Year’s Eve is entirely different in Japan, and amazing to join in Kyoto. SpringCherry blossoms in early MayBeautiful spring change of colors March-MayAoi Matsuri festival in Kyoto. SummerGreat festivals in Kyoto, including Gion Matsuri, Fire Festival, and cormorant fishing at Arashiyama  Packing tips for Japan?As I mentioned above, since Japan is so expensive (especially with the current super strong Japanese yen) it’s going to be immeasurably cheaper for you to take any/all toiletries, electronics, clothes, and personal items with you from your home country. If you need to buy anything in Japan, you’ll quickly be astounded at the asking price! Avoid wasting your money on toiletries and pack your own.In terms of clothes, it depends entirely on the season. Four seasons like Europe and N America. July and August very hot and humid. Winter same as Europe/ USA/Canada.One thing to note, at least out of curiosity, is that Japanese generally are immaculately dressed and groomed from head to toe. Sparkling clean well-co ordinated clothes, hair, make-up, nails, shoes and skin. They take pride in their clean ‘proper’ appearance, which to them looks professional and respectable. Overall, the N American habit of wearing super casual ‘bum’ clothes like faded jeans and t-shirts looks very scruffy to them. However, they don’t expect foreigners can keep up to their standards and are accustomed to foreigners’ different habits. They won’t be offended, they’ll just wonder why you’re dressed like a bum and don’t take better pride in your appearance.Besides all that, Japanese youth for at least 2 decades now has been dressing in all sorts of extreme, wild outfits, from all-out punks, goths, heavy metalers, to low-down rapper and rasta style. Therefore, more conservative Japanese have also become accustomed to a huge variety of fashions in their own country.Basically, just dress however you’re comfortable. But while in Japan take note of how immaculately groomed, dressed and ‘dressed up’ everyone is. I absolutely loved it and fit right in, since I’ve always been one to get dressed up head to toe and have never taken to the casual jeans/t shirt culture. Bio: Lash is an expat American who’s been traveling the world solo since 1998, mostly in Asia.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/kuang-si-waterfall-tips-photos-laos,Kuang Si Waterfall Tips and Photos – Laos,Laos," Kuang Si Waterfall in Laos – Heaven on Earth One of the highlights of a traveler’s stay in Luang Prabang, Laos usually includes a day trip to the Kuang Si Waterfalls (sometimes spelled Kuang Xi). We shared the 180 Kip tuk tuk ride with another couple who we had met the day before on our bus from Vang Vieng.I’m grateful we decided to beat the crowds and arrive at the falls before the afternoon busses and hoards of people. We almost had the falls to ourselves. Although, we did have to brave swimming before the afternoon sun hit the blue-green pools of water.Bring your suit and don’t forget to spray on the mosquito repellent. Contrary to popular belief, mosquito repellent is not something you only put on before you head out in the evening. Our travel buddy found out the hard way that Dengue Fever is contracted during daylight hours and this place is a breeding ground for those suckers.Scott and I didn’t wear any because this is actually when we first learned this fun fact about Dengue Fever.You can swim in one of the pools which also has a fun rope swing and falls to jump off. There are some pools that are non-swimming areas, so pay attention to the signs. Read More: The Ultimate Laos Travel Guide  Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Related Posts:Paradise in Arizona – Havasu FallsAn Island Fit For Kings – Koh Phangan"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/worship-and-waterfalls-in-laos,Worship and Waterfalls in Laos,Laos," Learning Valuable Lessons in Vang ViengWe awoke on the morning feeling we had everything in order to head to Luang Prabang from our hotel in Vang Vieng. After ordering our breakfast at Santanas, Scott went to change $20 for 162,000 Kip. We finished our meal and went back to the hotel (Grandview Hotel on the river by the tubing station) to check out and catch our taxi that was already waiting. Upon handing over our keys, the owner said we needed to pay for our two nights.Incidentally we had paid for the first night before we checked in and the second after deciding we would stay a second night. We got separate receipts for these two cash transactions. After only finding one receipt and some heated conversation, we had no choice but to pay for one extra night since we had booked our bus out of town with the same hotel owner. It was definitely one of those “woes of the road” moments, but we learned a good lesson about keeping receipts in a safe place until check out. We did in fact find the second receipt two hours later being used as a bookmark in our guidebook. However, turning around was not an option. The Drive from Vang Vieng to Luang PrabangAbout two hours before we arrived at Luang Prabang, we were stopped by some Lao men in uniform who told the driver we would be stopped for ten minutes. Upon further investigation, we found that a truck had gone over the edge of a cliff and they were attempting to pull it up with a larger truck. They were not successful, at least not while we were there. There didn’t seem to be anybody in the truck, so we all convinced ourselves that the driver was fine. They finally let the cars pass about thirty minutes later and we continued our way to Luang Prabang.It was difficult for me to keep from getting car sick the entire seven hour drive of screeching tires and turns taken at mock speed, but I was very hopeful I would make it without throwing up since we only had an hour to go. As I tried to push away thoughts of my stomach churning, a smell of wet cat food wafted through the van. Before I could tell what happened, we had stopped again and the girl behind me began cleaning her seat, the floor underneath my seat, and her clothing. She had thrown up so quietly that half of the bus had no idea. That being said, if you get car sick, I would suggest sitting up front with the driver, if possible, on this stretch of road. First Impressions of Luang PrabangOur first impression of Luang Prabang was that it is a very nice change of pace from Vang Vieng. It is a quirky city full of old buildings and outdoor markets. The city itself reminded us of Europe. And we were relieved not to find any sticky-floored cafes playing Friends or Family Guy.In Luang Prabang you can find a plethora of nice cafes with a variety of cuisines and many of them including free wifi. Or you can seek out an Internet Cafe for just 100 Kip per minute (about 75 cents per hour). LP is sandwiched between two rivers. We found that places to eat along the Mekong river are cheaper than the ones along the Mae Kok River river. A great place to eat breakfast is the Morning Glory Cafe with an assortment of teas, breakfast sandwiches and yummy pancakes. Nama Vong Guest HouseWe found a charming guest house on the Mekong river called Nama Vong for only 50,000 kip. Although, if it were up to our taxi driver, we would never had made it there. He stopped twice telling us we were at the guesthouse and both times we told him he was incorrect. Then he tried sneakier tactics of telling us that Nama Vong had no vacancy. But luckily if you call their bluff enough times, they will eventually take you to your requested destination.We settled into our room before we headed to get a Beer Lao and some free wifi. On our walk through town we ran into a couple who we had talked to briefly as we were stopped and waiting for the truck that drove over the edge to be pulled up. We made plans to meet them in the morning to share a taxi to the Kuang Si Falls.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 Lao New YearRight next to our hostel that evening, we were able to join in on some festivities of a ceremonial “Washing of the Buddha”. Droves of locals gathered in the Wat Xiang Thong Temple to give their offerings and take part in this spiritual event. The ritual of Washing of the Buddha celebrates the birth and enlightenment of Buddha. People approach the altar, fill a ladle with water or tea, and pour it over the figure to “wash” the baby buddha. Kuang Si FallsThe Kuang Si Falls were definitely one of the highlights of our stay in Laos. Gorgeous blue-green water, places to jump off the falls, a rope swing and free fish massages (if you stand in the water long enough the fish will nip at your toes). Quite a change from swiming in the brown river in Vang Vieng. Luang Prabang Street MarketLast but not least we strolled through the streets of Luang Prabang in the evening and feasted our eyes on local dishes throughout the popular street market. This is also a great place to purchase souvenirs. Don’t be afraid to haggle! We found an item we liked and the price started at $40 and ended at $8!"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/in-search-of-the-blue-lagoon,In Search of the “Blue Lagoon” – Vang Vieng,Laos," We set out that day with our rented beach cruisers and ghetto map in search of some caves and a “blue” lagoon. Yup, we snubbed the tours filled with young British punks and burnouts in training. Filled with the spirit of adventure, we thought we could find that hidden jewel that everyone missed by going on those tours. In hindsight, we must have been high. Phi Li Nang Cave and Swimming LagoonPeddling toward our destination — now on a much quieter dirt road — we saw a sign for the Phi Li Nang Cave and swimming lagoon. We excitedly took pictures the whole way, thinking this was going to be an amazing find. Soon we came upon two bridges and a shack, where the Laotian gatekeepers instructed us to pay 15 kip each for entrance fee, barely useable flashlights, and a private tour guide. While I decided to wait in safety, the guide — who was about 3/4’s of Scott’s size — took him into the first cave. He toured Scott around showing him stalactites and stalagmites. Good thing he didn’t try to lose Scott because it was too dark to see much even with a barely lit flashlight and I was waiting outside wondering for a moment if it was such a good idea for us to split up.I decided to join them on the tour of the next cave because they promised a lagoon! We walked and crawled for about 5 minutes when the ground suddenly sloped downward further than we could see. Our guide went first with no problem and found a spot within arms reach of us to stop so that he could pretend to help us down. Scott went next and that’s when things got interesting. I don’t think Locals (flip flops) are meant to be worn in slippery caves. Before I knew it, he was on his butt and sliding until the guide could grab him. We didn’t know how much further the drop was and at this point Scott was covered in mud, so we reluctantly turned back without seeing any lagoon.After that disappointing site, we peddled back to town and ran into the Norwegian man from our hotel. He explained to us his money woes while we bought him a beer. Trying not to let the day get away from us by letting this guy talk our ear off, we hurriedly asked him to direct us to the un-crowded “secret” blue lagoon that he had spoke of the day before.After searching for this lagoon for close to an hour, all we got was more sweaty, tired and frustrated on our beach cruiser bikes that were not meant to be going off-roading. Finally we gave up on finding the secret spot, went back into town, and asked a few people how to get to the touristy blue lagoon. How to Get to the Blue LagoonYou get to this lagoon by crossing the only bridge in Vang Vieng where you have to pay a toll. That is how you know you are at the right bridge. We asked the toll collector at the bridge how far it was to the lagoon. He effortlessly explained it was 15 minutes there and 15 minutes back. So after 45 minutes down a bumpy dirt road, numerous times of wanting to turn back, and several tourists passing us on motorbikes (the smart choice), we finally arrived at the “blue” lagoon.Our hearts sank when we asked some people heading back from the lagoon how it looked.“Not so blue. We are going to the cave instead”.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Walking the final 100 meters to our destination, we realized the lagoon was nothing more than a mosquito-ridden pond filled with stagnant water. But as hot as we were, that didn’t stop us from taking a dip!I think the best part of my day was on our ride back from the lagoon. We rode our bikes through herds and herds of cattle that were walking along the dirt road. This is how I imagined Laos to be!"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/the-hidden-jewel-of-southeast-asia,Laos Travel Guide: Vientiane to Vang Vieng,Laos,"This Laos travel guide covers our tips for traveling from Vientiane to Vang Vieng and things to do in each destination as well as Thailand to Laos border crossing tips!We awoke on the train with about an hour left before we arrived in Nong Kai, the Thai border town. Supposedly, it’s a great place to take a cruise down the river and watch the sunset. If you catch it in October, you will see some amazing phosphorescent bubbles (Naga Fireball) rising from the river. Laos Travel Guide: Vientiane to Vang Vieng Land Border Crossing from Thailand to LaosThe border is a place where you can end up paying some extra money if you don’t know what you’re doing. All you need is your passport, one passport photo and your visa fee ($35 US). We took a tuk tuk from the station to the border for 100 Baht (don’t even try to haggle, it was useless).We were taken to an office where they told us we needed to pay our entrance fee plus 400 Baht ($14 US) to cross. We refused, and told them to take us to the border. When we got there we were bombarded with more people offering to take us across the border for 200 Baht.All you need to do is take the bus across (15 Baht) and then pay your visa fee. After the bus, we took another tuk tuk into Vientiane where we met a couple from Israel who urged us not to go to Vietnam after Laos. They said they hated it and felt like they were getting ripped off at every turn. This was disappointing news considering we already had our flight booked from Laos to Vietnam in a week. Mixay Guesthouse in VientianeThe tuk tuk dropped us off in the middle of town and from there we found a hostel called Mixay Guesthouse. We stumbled upon Mixay while looking for a different guest house that we had found in our guide book. It was $14 US per night for a private room and bath with A/C. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and it was also a great place to meet other travelers.Vientiane was not exactly high on our list of places to see. It was merely a place to stay the night after crossing the border from Thailand, and before heading to Vang Vieng. The bright spot for us in Vientiane was visiting a few temples, meeting some fellow travelers at our hostel, and eating one of the best falafels we have ever had! Bus Ride from Vientiane to Vang ViengJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Our “VIP” bus to Vang Vieng was not what I would call VIP. Most of the ride I spent bent over my knees, trying not to get sick. The window next to us looked like it had been glued together in about 20 different spots by something that resembled tar.I prayed that the next bump would not break my seat since Scott’s seat cushion had already come out from under him three times. After three hours of grueling corners and constant bumps on a bus with no shocks, I was ready to kiss the ground when we arrived in Vang Vieng. The Otherside Bungalows in Vang ViengOf course the bus dropped us off right in front of a hotel. Thinking this was a bit suspect, we took the advice of some travelers we had met in Vientiane and made our way to the Otherside Bungalows. We were told it was just across the river and with the help of some friendly hippie employees advertising free joints at one of the local bars, we made our way across a narrow, rickety, wooden bridge.At first, the hotel seemed nice enough. They showed us to our bungalow, complete with outdoor hammock, private bathroom and a couple of free cats already in our bed. After settling in, we decided to pay for the room and get our key. A mere 50,000 Kip, ($5 US) what a steal!A nice enough Norwegian couple was able to help with the translation as the owners seemed to speak no English. They gave us our key, which didn’t work in our bungalow.We spent the next hour trying to communicate with the Laotian owners so that we could get a key that actually worked. Four keys later and two new bungalows, we were finally walking across the makeshift bridge to get some much needed lunch. The Town of Vang ViengVang Vieng is a party town for sure. Most of the restaurants have pillows for seats. It’s a great place to chill and relax for a few days. There are quite a few outdoor restaurants that play “Friends” or “Family Guy” reruns. Upon first glance, it seemed pretty fun to sit back on a few pillows, watch TV, eat and drink in an outdoor restaurant.Although, after a few days, you realize your ONLY choice is to watch Friends or Family Guy. We also found that most of the tables and seats at these places were dirty and at one place in particular, the floor was so sticky that it really was challenging to walk through the restaurant. But that didn’t stop all the travelers from eating there!You will find the food and drink to be pretty cheap in Vang Vieng, even compared to other places in SE Asia. We were not really too excited about what Laotian cuisine had to offer, besides the beer Lao of course!Although, most restaurants in Lao sure do know how to make a delicious chicken sandwich! Something about those toasted chicken, mayo and cheese filled baguettes seemed to follow us everywhere in Lao. So that is our memory of the food in Lao, $1 chicken sandwiches. And we were not alone. We met some other travelers who also shared our chicken sandwich infatuation.We did find a really great restaurant along the river called “Santana”. The family that owns it are genuinely friendly and that’s what really makes this place special. They were the nicest locals we encountered in Vang Vieng.At many of the other places we went in both Vang Vieng and Vientiane the staff seemed annoyed and irritated to be serving us. In addition to Laotian dishes and chicken sandwiches, this restaurant also serves the Thai dessert dish of mangoes and sticky rice that will appease your sweet tooth. Tubing in Vang ViengDuring a visit to Vang Vieng, one simply must try tubing down the river. 55,000 kip per person will get you a ride up the river and a large tractor inner tube. At the drop off point, your first impression might be the deafening blare of rave-like music and the screams of thrill seekers as they splash into the chocolate milk colored water. We weren’t sure if the water was brown from being dirty or if it was just the mud from the bottom. Maybe a little of both.Nobody else around seemed to mind the color of the water so we jumped on our tubes and instantly got thrown a line by the first bar offering to reel us in. The empty plastic water bottle to the face took me a little by surprise.We decided to skip the first bar since it seemed unexciting, but we were lured in by the second bar’s slapdash zip line. Although it was fun to watch all the debauchery, we weren’t ready to take part in it. I like to be able to see the rocks in the water before I land on them! Maybe in my younger days I would have been a little more reckless.It’s fun to chill and have a beer or two and then be on your way. The best part for us was after we passed all the bars and noise. The last 3/4 stretch of river is a quiet, peaceful tubing experience where all you have to do is sit back and gaze at the beautiful scenery.During the dry season it will take about 3 hours to tube down the river, whereas the wet season takes 1 hour, so plan accordingly. You don’t want to get caught on the river at dark. Unless you brought your bug spray with you! Oh, and you won’t get your tube deposit back if you show up past 6pm! Have you been to Laos? If so, what is your take on it?"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/mauritius-travel-tips-africa,"Mauritius Travel Tips – When to Go, How to Get There & Where to Stay!",Mauritius,"Thinking of traveling to Mauritius? Our Mauritius travel tips cover the best time to visit, where to stay, how to get there, and more!Where in the world is Mauritius?How do you get to Mauritius?What language do Mauritians speak?What is so special about Mauritius?These were just a few of the questions Scott and I received from friends before our departure to Mauritius last month. We had a general idea of where the island is located, but I’m ashamed to say that we didn’t have decent answers to the rest of these questions.The island of Mauritius is a somewhat well-known destination in Europe, but it’s not frequented by too many Americans or Canadians.It’s located 2,000 miles off the southeast coast of Africa, so it can be quite a trek for those traveling from the United States or Canada. (It took us about thirty to thirty-five hours to travel from San Diego to Mauritius). That’s not to say this destination is not worth the long hours in the air. Sunrise at the St. Regis MauritiusMauritius is an entire nation of immigrants, many of which are from India. The official language of the island is English, however, more people speak French and Mauritian Creole.The fact that almost all of the locals speak English makes this an ideal destination for English-speaking travelers. Creole is the informal language and is spoken in homes and between friends. This language was created by the slaves in the 18th century because they needed a language to communicate with other slaves and with their French masters.A good portion of the island is surrounded by an outer reef, which creates calm and piercingly-blue lagoons for swimming and water sports. This also creates a safety net for water sport enthusiasts who have a fear of sharks.

We are all about helping others learn from our mistakes, so here’s one of them: if you are headed from the United States to Mauritius, go through Dubai instead of Paris.The Dubai route eliminates a few key inconveniences. The Dubai airport is one of the most comfortable places to spend a long layover, and after your first flight, you will want some time to relax.I recommend giving yourself at least a six-hour layover. This will let you stretch your legs, get a room at an airport hotel, sleep a few hours, and take a shower. Trust me, two twelve-hour flights in a row may not seem that bad on paper, but it’s not something either of us wants to experience again anytime soon. Read more: 25 Best Honeymoon Destinations In The World (And Where To Stay) If you go through Paris, there is a chance you will have a stop on Reunion Island. That might not sound too bad in theory, until you realize last minute (ahem… like we did) that you only have three hours to clear customs at Paris Charles De Gaulle, grab your luggage, and maneuver your way to catch a bus (that will most likely be late) to Orly airport, which is over an hour away.The Paris route is fine, as long as your second flight goes directly to Mauritius on a flight that leaves from Charles De Gaulle, but the Dubai route is better.Once you arrive, you can either rent a car or let someone else do the driving for you. We knew we would be too tired to drive on our arrival, so we booked car transfers instead. Your hotel will likely offer this service, or you can book through Maki Car Rental who offers tours and transfers, as well as car rentals. The Best Time To Visit MauritiusMy only complaint about Mauritius is the unpredictable weather in the winter. I personally love hot, hot, hot weather when I’m visiting an island because I want to be in the ocean at all times. If you prefer balmy weather and lukewarm ocean water, like we do, I suggest visiting in their summer (November to May).The wind is also calmer during the summer, which will provide those glassy ocean conditions which are perfect for surfing, SUP and kayaking. However, if you like mild temperatures or any water sport that requires wind, such as kitesurfing, then winter is the time to visit. Traveling to Mauritius: Why is it so special?Besides the welcoming locals, the laid-back island vibe, and the stunning views, our trip to Mauritius came with a few firsts. It marked the first time Scott and I have been to Africa and yet there wasn’t a need for malaria pills or special immunizations.Scott tried water skiing for the first time and, thanks to his instructor at the Four Seasons Resort, he did an excellent job. It was also his first time sailing. I guess you can throw in the first time he capsized a boat too. (I’m glad I didn’t join him on that boat ride.)We’ve been to dozens of tropical islands, many of which don’t require thirty hours to reach by plane, so what makes Mauritius so special? That’s a great question.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/reasons-visit-mauritius-africa,8 Reasons to Visit Mauritius,Mauritius,"In our first post about the island of Mauritius, we shared our advice on the best way to get there and the ideal times to visit, but we didn’t delve too much into why we loved it so much.Because there are so many variables that can affect how you feel about a destination, it can be tough to put your finger on why you prefer one destination over another. After our visit to Mauritius, we had this exact feeling and couldn’t put our feelings into words. But going through our photos and sharing stories with friends really gave us a sense of the reasons we’re smitten with the island and why we chose to travel there in the first place. 8 Reasons to Visit Mauritius in Africa 1. Ile aux Cerfs … and StarfishAm I the only one who thinks starfish are amazing? We rarely see starfish in San Diego, so the thought of visiting an island covered in starfish was like a dream come true. These stars of the sea can be found on the uninhabited island of Ile aux Cerfs, just a short boat ride from The Four Seasons Mauritius (who offers a complimentary boat shuttle for resort guests).On the hunt for solitude and sea stars, we took the advice of a staff member at our resort and followed a small dirt path, which led to a quiet beach on the opposite side of the tiny harbor. This is where you’ll find hundreds of starfish along the shore, on the midnight colored rocks, and in ankle-deep water. I highly recommend wearing shoes along the beach because this area also has a thriving sea urchin population! 2. Protected LagoonsThe entire island of Mauritius is surrounded by coral reefs, creating glassy lagoons out of reach of big fish (AKA sharks). The healthy coral reef attracts sea life, making this a perfect spot for snorkeling and glass bottom boat trips. The calm water also provides ideal conditions for kayaking, SUP, and even learning how to sail for the first time. 3. RomanceThere’s no shortage of luxurious beachfront resorts for relaxing with your loved one. Mauritius attracts couples looking for some quiet time to reconnect and it’s also a great spot for a romantic honeymoon. That said, we did see a few young families at the St. Regis, but it wasn’t overrun with energetic kids. The relaxing vibe of this tropical island seems to envelop visitors from the moment they land at the airport.  4. Chamarel Seven Colored EarthJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					I feel lucky that we didn’t miss a visit to this natural wonder. It wasn’t on our original agenda, but our Mauritian tour guide offered to make a stop here on our way from Mahebourg to The St. Regis Mauritius. This geological formation is comprised of sand dunes with seven different distinct colors — red, brown, violet, green, blue, purple and yellow. The dunes surprisingly never erode and the colors are caused by the decomposition of volcanic rock. If you pick up a handful of sand and mix the colors together, they will eventually separate again — it’s truly an amazing phenomenon. 5. Rhumerie de ChamarelJust a short distance from Seven Colored Earth, you’ll find the Rhumerie de Chamarel — one of Mauritius’ most popular attractions. Half hour tours of this rum distillery are available from Monday through Saturday for about 350 Rupees. I’m told the restaurant — L’Alchimiste — is one of the best places to eat lunch on the island and serves unique cuisine, prepared with local products sourced from the estate. 6. The LocalsEvery local we encountered went out of their way to help us. They are proud of their island and seem happy to share it with visitors. A friend of ours who lives in Mauritius speaks very highly of the locals and has dozens of stories about Mauritians going out of their way to help her — in the supermarket, on the street, etc. 7. Endless Water SportsWhat is your favorite water sport? We love them all, so we spent most of our time in the warm water. We visited the island in the winter — the windiest time of year — which is ideal for sailing and windsurfing. Mauritius is home to a world class windsurfing spot — right next to the St. Regis — so even if you don’t want to try it for yourself, it’s one heck of a show. Mornings are generally calm, even in the winter, so that’s when you’ll want to take out a kayak, SUP or paddle boat. Waterskiing and wakeboarding can be done year round, however, the resorts will only take the boat out if the tide is high enough (otherwise you might find yourself landing on a patch of sharp coral). Snorkeling can obviously be done year round, but the visibility and water temperature is at its finest in the summer. Summertime — when the winds die down — is also the ideal season for surfing. 8. Sunrises and SunsetsEven after a few days of acclimating to the twelve hour time difference, we still made sure to wake up before sunrise every single day. Here’s why…. We didn’t want to miss a single sunrise or sunset the entire time we were on the island because they were all uniquely gorgeous. We were never disappointed. Plan Your Trip to Mauritius, AfricaAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/st-regis-mauritius,Mentally Recharging at St. Regis Mauritius,Mauritius," St. Regis Mauritius Resort ReviewWe’ve never really mastered the art of relaxation during our travels. Even before our trips became more work focused, our idea of a good time almost always includes exploring everything a destination has to offer. After four years of blogging, we’ve also developed a need to take notes to prepare for future blog posts.I told myself Mauritius would be different. I was determined to force myself to relax and recharge my batteries. We all know how overwhelming life can get and I think it’s important to take time to reconnect with yourself and spend time away from daily stresses.We arrived to the stunning St. Regis Mauritius Resort, sticky with sweat and ready to relax. After checking in, a staff member insisted on chauffeuring us to our ocean-view room. The butler assigned to our room gave us a tour, making sure we knew how to work all of the gadgets.After the tour, he asked if we wanted him to unpack our suitcases. Now, we’ve stayed at dozens of 5-star resorts and this was the first time someone has offered to unpack our bags. As much as we wanted to be pampered, we graciously declined, but made note of it for our departure.Before leaving, our butler informed us he would be setting up two lounge chairs on the beach in front of our bungalow. Did he read my mind?As I opened the curtains to our private terrace, the scene looked like something out of a dream. The ocean along the gorgeous Le Morne peninsula appeared to have been painted by an artist. Our cozy terrace housed a cute table for two and comfortable love seat. The ivory white colonial architecture of each building gave the appearance of a community of small homes, contrasting beautifully with the turquoise lagoon.St. Regis Mauritius Resort Deluxe Ocean View RoomFirst things first. I hit the beach. There wasn’t another soul on our small strip of sand and no other hotel guests to wrestle for an open lounge chair. The sound of tiny waves lapping against the shore immediately began to melt away the tension in my body.I know what you are thinking, “Why would I be stressed in Mauritius?”Well, my mind rarely ever shuts off and I’m constantly making mental lists.

I’ll admit that I logged into wifi at the St. Regis, but with so many opportunities to loaf in a lounge chair, snorkel, kayak, sail, and float in the clear lagoon, I rarely had the desire to check in online. Each morning, instead of checking emails, we created a new routine — wake up just before sunrise, explore this gorgeous resort’s property, have a leisurely breakfast, and then decide which water sport we wanted to do.St. Regis Mauritius Plan Your Trip to St. Regis Mauritius:The St. Regis Mauritius Resort is located on the southwest side of the island — on the Le Morne Peninsula. I recommend booking the half board rate, which includes daily buffet breakfast and dinner at one of the resort’s restaurants. The St. Regis is within close proximity to a small town and grocery store (either by cab or bus) so it’s easy enough to grab lunch or just explore the surrounding area.The Le Morne Peninsula is home to some of Mauritius’ prettiest beaches, best snorkeling reefs, and world class windsurfing. With a butler, unlimited water activities, six restaurants, and top-notch service, we found this resort to be a tremendous value for a luxury 5-star resort in this location. For more information about traveling in Mauritius, read our Mauritius travel tips and detailed Mauritius travel guide.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/four-seasons-mauritius-resort-review,"Four Seasons Mauritius: It’s Like Home, But Much Better",Mauritius," Four Seasons Mauritius Resort ReviewThe impressive coastline of Mauritius is peppered with luxurious resorts which would make any traveler drool. As loyal Four Seasons customers, we chose to spend our first couple of days in Mauritius at the Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita.The Four Seasons is situated on the east coast of Mauritius on its own 11 acre private island. The entire resort is comprised of villas — each differing in size — which makes this resort a unique place to stay in Mauritius. Each of the 123 villas has it’s own private yard and plunge pool — with either a view of the ocean, a garden view, or panoramic views of mangrove trees. The way the resort is laid out gives guests a feeling of privacy and eliminates noise from neighbors. Without consulting each other beforehand, Scott and I each came up with one word to describe the Four Seasons Resort in Mauritius. I wasn’t too surprised when we each came up with very similar words.Warm and welcoming.After reading numerous online reviews, the impeccable service and attention to detail seems to be a recurring theme in other guest reviews. The Four Seasons Mauritius feels comfortable like home, with a welcoming staff, top-notch restaurants, your own private plunge pool, and beaches that will take your breath away. The Four Seasons Mauritius ResortUpon arrival, the staff immediately unloaded our luggage and led us to an open-air sitting room with couches, overlooking a gorgeous blue lagoon. After a fresh passionfruit and kaffir lime welcome drink, we were conveniently driven to our villa in a golf buggy. The resort is not as spread out as I would have expected, so the buggies are not necessary, but it’s a nice touch and definitely a welcome surprise after a long journey. I’ll admit, we even called for a buggy to give us a ride to dinner a few times when we were feeling lazy.I’m repeatedly impressed with the ability of the Four Seasons chain to think of everything before their guests even ask — mosquito coil on the patio, bug spray in every villa, and sunblock available by the pool and beach. The daily breakfast at Beau Champ was definitely a highlight during our stay. This spacious restaurant is surrounded by water, filled with a variety of colorful fish. We ordered delicious dishes from our server that ranged from Madagascar Eggs Benedict to River Prawn Frittata covered with a Vanilla and Lobster Bisque. As those dishes were being prepared, we headed for the buffet to load up on fresh vegetable and fruit juice (made to order), Indian cuisine, pastries, and unlimited brie. Water Activities at the Four Seasons MauritiusOne of the most important things for us when choosing a hotel on a tropical island is the distance from a beach with opportunities for water sports. The Four Seasons Mauritius offers waterskiing (it’s where Scott tried it for the first time!) and all other non-motorized water sports complimentary to guests. The boathouse is located on Bambou Beach, where you can rent kayaks and peddle boats or sign up for the daily snorkel boat, a trip to Ile aux Cerfs island, glass bottom boat trips, or sailing on a Hobie Cat.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 The Spa at the Four Seasons MauritiusThe Spa at the Four Seasons Mauritius is located in several small villas overlooking the ocean. The villa suites include a changing room, massage room, shower, and steam room. Relaxing lemongrass and ginger tea from the spa garden is served before and after each massage. The Mauritian Fusion treatment was the perfect combination of a deep and relaxing massage. Plan Your Trip to the Four Seasons MauritiusAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights:Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

It’s the boarding pass on top.”“You are going alone?” He asks in a concerned tone.“Yes, I travel to Mexico alone quite often.”The man still seemed a little uneasy, so I felt the need to tell him I would be meeting people there. This being my first time to Cancun, I began to wonder what was the cause for concern. I didn’t get into more details since all I wanted to do was get through security and catch my 6:30AM flight departure.My guess is that his worry was not for a woman traveling solo to Cancun, (although in Cancun my biggest problem would most likely be the drunk Americans) but travel to Mexico as a whole. I found it hard to believe airport personnel would give into the media hype and instill fear into passengers about the safety of the entire country of Mexico.Frequent travelers to Mexico know the truth, but it still often shocks me every time I hear people say that all areas of Mexico are unsafe. Even though this was my first time to Riviera Maya, the possibility of it not being safe for travelers didn’t even cross my mind.Riviera Maya did surprise me though.I arrived here thinking that Riviera Maya and Playa Del Carmen was a destination with beautiful beaches, ancient ruins and exciting nightlife. Although I did find all of this to be true, I was also introduced to a few of the more unique things about the area.I found underground rivers, floating down a lazy river with jaw-dropping scenery, riding in fast cars, and the eclectic cuisine were actually my highlights of the trip.

This is truly one of the few ways to really experience the beauty of this place.UnCruise offers a range of activities at each port — skiff tours, snorkeling, kayaking, paddleboarding, and hiking. This particular cruise also includes a 30-minute massage by a well-trained therapist, daily yoga classes, gourmet meals, and gym equipment on the upper sundeck.You’ll also enjoy getting to know everyone on the ship, as the typical cruise size is a bout 50-80 guests and all meals are family style seating.While I’ve included each of the stops on my particular itinerary, these can change slightly depending on weather. AmortajadaThis little cove boasts a mangrove forest and a quiet beach — a relaxing location to start off your island hopping!Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					UnCruise Adventures even hosts beach parties at many of the stops, setting up camp for everyone with water, beer, snacks, and even an occasional bonfire, which was a pleasant and welcomed surprise. I also loved that the ship and beach parties were fully equipped with reef-safe sunblock. I appreciate when companies are environmentally conscious. Bahia Agua VerdeThe glassy waters of this picturesque fishing village make for perfect kayaking in a secluded bay, or socializing with the locals on a mule ride. This particular stop actually sits on mainland Mexico, but it’s not easily accessible by land. Isla Espíritu SantoEspíritu Santo is outlined by beautiful rocky sea cliffs, not to mention home of families of sea lions. This island has been on my bucket list for years, so I was thrilled to see this on the itinerary! Isla San FranciscoOn Isla San Francisco, you’ll get the chance to go on an awesome ridge hike, witness some of Mexico’s coolest salt flats, and relax on a beautiful beach. This island is particularly known for its amazing snorkeling with vibrant marine life, including octopus, starfish, and even sea turtles. Los IslotesIf swimming with sea lions sounds like your idea of a magical day in paradise, you will love Los Islotes. We took skiffs tours out to this little island and snorkeled with these adorable and playful creatures. Isla PartidaThis island — connected underwater to Isla Espíritu Santo — is a UNESCO-protected biosphere and a spot known for great kayaking. La PazNow THIS is what this gulf is known for, and why people come to the Sea of Cortez. On your final day, you’ll arrive back into La Paz — and actually get to go swimming with whale sharks.

Even if it doesn’t rain, this will block the wind and keep you warm on chilly nights.  Sarong: Sarongs might be one of the best travel fashion pieces because you can wear it in a variation of settings — whether it’s on the boat deck, on the beach, or dressed up as a skirt and paired with a cute top for a night out. Biodegradable Wipes: These biodegradable wipes with tea tree and aloe are perfect for freshening up in the morning or washing your face before bed.  Portable Charger: I bring one or two of these portable chargers on every trip — especially when traveling on boats. Spring Wetsuit: UnCruise does provide wetsuits, but I found the water warm enough to use my shorty wetsuit which is a lot more comfortable than a full wetsuit and it also means I don’t have to wear a used wetsuit! Read More:How to Pack for a Sailing TripStaying at the JW Marriott Guanacaste in Costa RicaVilla Del Palmar, Loreto: A Quiet Getaway on the Sea of CortezThe Best Travel Cameras for 2018Into the Wild: Life Aboard the Wilderness AdventurerStaying at Ocean Club Resort in Turks & Caicos"

While the country is beautiful year round, your experience will differ greatly depending on the region, the activities, and the month.Norway is a long, large country and is diverse in weather and tourism hotspots. Summer in Norway brings with it long days, great weather, lively scenes, and inevitably, higher prices.November through January tends to bring very intense snowy conditions and limited sun — conditions that some travelers will find harsh. Meanwhile, spring and fall are great for lower costs on accommodation, but it’s important to double check if your preferred activities will be doable, as many of them are seasonal.See below to learn about the best seasons to see Norway’s most popular sites! Table of ContentsThe Best Time to Visit Norway (Depending On What You Want To See)Visiting Norway in the WinterThings to See in Norway During WinterVisiting Norway in the SpringThings to See in Norway During SpringVisiting Norway in the SummerThings to See in Norway During SummerVisiting Norway in the FallThings to Do in Norway During FallPlan Your Trip to NorwayThe Best Time to Visit Norway (Depending On What You Want To See) Visiting Norway in the WinterA season that is generally shrouded in darkness due to Norway’s northerly geography, winter brings with it a calm, winter-wonderland paradise feeling that is hard to get in the livelier, tourism-heavy months.Just remember that during winter, the temperature can get very cold (around -40C/-40F in some places), and if you’re headed above the Arctic Circle, know that there are months when the sun doesn’t rise at all. Things to See in Norway During Winter  Northern LightsJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					One of the most magical experiences you can have in Norway, catching a glimpse of the Northern lights is worth braving the cold for. Due to darkness being an essential component to seeing the Northern Lights, you can generally catch them any time from October through March.Also note that not all of Norway is prime Aurora Borealis territory. For the best chance of seeing the lights, you’ll want to head at least as North as Bodo, although your chances increase the more North you go.   Snow ActivitiesIf you’re headed to Norway on a ski or snowmobile trip, then you’ll find late February and early March to be optimal. Not only do these times have more daylight hours than December, January, but it’s also a prime time for snowfall. Read more: What to Pack for a Trip to Norway Visiting Norway in the SpringA time in Norway full of blooming flowers, melting snow, and seasonal waterfalls, April, and May, and June in Norway bring with them a sense of renewal and freshness. However, Spring in Norway is notoriously fickle, and depending on what region you visit the warmer weather might start in Late February, whereas in other places skiing will still be in full swing late April.Wherever you’re headed in Norway, be sure to check the forecast so you know what to expect! Things to See in Norway During Spring  CitiesWhether you’re interested in visiting cosmopolitan Oslo, picturesque Bergen, or one of the other charming cities in Norway, activities will be plentiful and accommodation open no matter what time of year you visit.Winter is excellent for visiting cities if you’re looking to check out some winter sports and save money on accommodation, while summer has great weather and a livelier atmosphere.If you’re looking for the best of both worlds, I’d recommend visiting Norway’s cities in late spring when the crowds are slim, the streets are walkable, the prices are relatively easy on the wallet, and the flowers are in bloom.  Sami Culture & ReindeerNorway is home to both wild and tame Reindeer, and while you can find the animals all over the country, I recommend digging into some local Sami culture while you’re at it. The Sami are an indigenous population throughout Norway, and Reindeer are part of their traditional culture.To do this, I suggest visiting Norway in early spring when the days start getting longer and the snow is still on the ground for Reindeer sledding.By the way, Reindeer is also a national dish, so prepare yourself for seeing it on the menu before you get too attached! Read more: How to Travel in Norway on a Budget Visiting Norway in the SummerIf you visit Norway during the months of June, July, and August be prepared for long days and warmer weather.

During this season Norway becomes lively, with locals out and about and the major tourism season in full swing.If you plan on visiting Norway in Summer, book your accommodation as early in advance as you can, as many popular places tend to sell out and hike up their prices. Things to See in Norway During Summer  Midsummer EveEvery year on June 23, Norwegians gather to celebrate Sankthansaften, or Midsummer Eve. Expect to come across many parties and bonfires! Read more: Norway Travel Tips: Everything You Need to Know  Midnight SunA natural phenomenon that occurs above the Arctic Circle between late May and mid-July, the midnight sun is like an extended sunset and sunrise all at once.

Bring cozy sweaters and long pants!  Polar BearsIf you’re heading up to the Northern Norway archipelago of Svalbard, then going on a polar bear cruise is a must. The cruises tend to run from May through early September and are all about witnessing polar bears in their natural habitat.While you’re in Svalbard, also consider going dog sledding, glacier trekking, snowmobiling, and dive into the local culture in the towns of Longyearbyen and Barentsburg. Read more: The Ultimate Guide to Norway’s Fjord Region Visiting Norway in the FallBeginning in September, Fall graces Norway with chillier temperatures and colorful leaves. During the Autumnal season, tourism takes a dip, meaning the sites are less crowded and prices tend to go down.Fall is also the harvesting season in Norway, so expect a lot of fresh, local food that’s a little richer in keeping with the season. Things to Do in Norway During Fall  See the FjordsSome of the most dramatic sights in all of Norway, visiting at least a couple fjords is a must during your trip.Depending on which fjords you visit (Geirangerfjord is a favorite), expect the scene to be very busy in the summertime, especially if the one you’re visiting is a cruise ship stop. To see a fjord in all of its luscious glory without the crowds, I’d recommend visiting in the early fall. You’ll still be able to go hiking and kayaking, and there won’t be any residual snow.One of the longest and deepest fjords in Norway, Geirangerfjord is located in the southwestern part of the country, about 350 km north of Bergen. The fjord is one of the most popular in the country, no doubt due to the still water and 2000-meter tall mountains towering above.

Connecting two of Norway’s most important cities, this 495-kilometer track will give you awesome views of fjords, fields, traditional fishing villages, and waterfalls.The route is absolutely beautiful year round, but there’s just something about seeing all the pretty fall colors fly by the window.

Created as a result of retreating glaciers, the fjords cover Norway’s coastline and you can spend weeks exploring the different branches and valleys, all with something different to offer; whether that’s sailing, swimming or simply viewing.The best thing about the Fjords is that the region has become popular enough to attract transport operators who want to provide routes through the area. From scenic train journeys to picturesque cruises, there are virtually endless ways to soak up the rugged beauty of the glacial wonders. We’ve put together our best tips to help you plan a trip to this epic region of Norway! Travel Guide to Norway’s Fjord Region CruiseNorway boasts one of the longest coastlines in the world, so it stands to reason that one of the best ways to see it would be from the water. Its a favorite for many travelers because its a leisurely, all-inclusive way to navigate the numerous fjords while enjoying all the comforts of a hotel room in your cabin.The biggest advantage is that you won’t have to continuously worry about packing and unpacking your luggage every time you reach a destination, you only have to do it once when you board and once when you leave!The coastal steamer Hurtigruten is one of the best options for cruises in the Fjord Region. Heading north from Bergen, the ship passes through islets, archipelagos, and towns like Ålesund and Molde, both great destinations to hop off at and explore. Finally, if you really want to have a cruise-filled vacation, you can combine the trip around the Fjord with an in or outbound cruise ship to another European destination.

It’s definitely worth spending a day here exploring the town, full of white and red barn houses standing at the water’s edge and photo opportunities around every corner.Once you’re ready to set off, head north to the Trollstigen National Tourist Route where you’ll be treated to one of the world’s best mountain drives, complete with 180 degree bends in the roads that rise up past the clouds. The great thing about renting a car is that you’ve got complete control over where you stop, and with this much incredible scenery, you’ll be glad!Geirangerfjord in NorwayTo get to some deep fjords where you can sometimes see whales and seals playing in the water, you’ll need to head back down to Åndalsnes where the land begins to open up until you get to Molde, a beautiful seaside community that looks similar to Alaskan waterfront towns on account of the visible snow peaks dotted around the horizon.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					From here it’s a question of heading north up the coast for as long as you wish, though you have the freedom to deviate as far up into the mountains as you please. Fly Into AlesundWe chose to fly into Alesund, rented a car there and drove one way from Alesund to Bergen — stopping at several fjords along the way. This cut down on our driving time so we were able to spend more time hiking and less time stuck in the car. This also gave us the opportunity to spend a few nights in the beautiful town of Alesund — which is definitely worth a visit! Read more: How to Travel in Norway on a Budget TrainThe rail lines running through the Fjord Region offer a different perspective to cruise ships and cars on account of how quickly they rise and descend in and out of the mountains.The Flam railway is one of the most stunning train routes on the planet and it’s easy to see why. In the short space of one hour, you travel from sea level at Sognefjord to over 800 meters above at Myrdal. Expect spectacular scenery including enormous waterfalls, towering mountains and numerous tunnels taking you from one landscape to the next. Fjord DestinationsWith literally hundreds of fjords in the region, it really depends on preference when deciding which ones to prioritize, so I’ve decided to include two of my favorite to give you a place to start. GeirangerfjordFor many people, the magnificent Geirangerfjord is at the top of their list of favorite fjords and after visiting, it becomes apparent why. The valley is surreally beautiful, with banks of cloud adorning the steep, forested mountains and a group of waterfalls known as the Seven Sisters falling from 250m into the fjord itself.Don’t miss out on Flydalsjuvet and the Geiranger Skywalk in Dalsnibba, both absolutely breathtaking viewpoints that will give you unprecedented panoramic views of the fjord below. Where to Stay in Geirangerfjord: Lunheim Accomodation and Homlong Gjestetun- Fjelltun are both in ideal locations and have absolutely stunning views!!Sognefjord in Norway SognefjordAlso known as the “King of the fjords”, Sognefjord is easily the longest fjord in Norway and the second-longest in the entire world! It truly is a humbling sight to behold and the vast expanses of glassy water are perfect for wide-angle shots and even monochrome photography if you’re trying to capture the icy tones.For more frozen expanses, you can head up to the fjord’s inner end, which is covered by Jostedalsbreen, continental Europe’s largest glacier! Where to Stay in Sognefjord: Karistova Utleige and Marifjøra Sjøbuer both come highly recommended and the location can’t be beat! Pin it!"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/nepal-travel-guide-packing-tips,The Ultimate Nepal Travel Guide + Packing Tips,Nepal,"This in-depth travel guide covers tips on where to stay, what to do, what to expect, and what to pack for a trip to Nepal.Nepal is a country of shocking natural beauty and immense spiritual kindness. Home to eight of the world’s ten highest mountain peaks, including Mount Everest, and a host of jungle valleys, rolling hills, and fertile river basins, Nepal offers numerous opportunities for photographers and outdoor enthusiasts.The country is also notable as the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, as well as being home to a number of impressive Hindu temples, making it the perfect destination for travelers interested in hiking, photography, and ethno-tourism. Table of ContentsNepal Travel Guide & Packing Tips How to Get to Nepal Transportation in Nepal Food & Culture in Nepal Packing Essentials for Nepal Things to Do in NepalNepal Travel Guide & Packing Tips  How to Get to NepalOn-arrival tourist visas are available for citizens of most countries at several border entry points, as well as Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. This makes flying into Nepal an easy travel option.Should you be visiting from Tibet or India, crossing by car or bus at a designated border crossing is also possible. Keep in mind that if you plan to volunteer while in Nepal, that is technically considered “work” and you can be fined if volunteering on a tourist visa without prior permission.  Transportation in NepalOnce in Nepal, microbuses, taxis, and long-distance tourist buses can get you around from location to location, or you can rent a motorbike. There are also several domestic airlines which provide regular flights between Kathmandu and popular destinations like Pokhara and Bharatpur.Trekking is also popular amongst tourists, with each region offering its own set of circuits. Treks can be arranged through IPPG approved tourism centers or trekking companies if you wish to join a group or explore less traveled circuits.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					 If you’re not used to independent travel in developing countries, you may want to look into booking a guided tour — even if it’s just for a portion of your trip. This tour covers a lot of the same locations I visited and 12 days is the perfect amount of time to spend in Nepal. I would, however, add more time if you plan on doing some trekking. Here is a 8-night tour option as well.Nepal is one of the few countries I’ve ever booked a group tour and I’m honestly glad I did. I’ve traveled independently through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia and these countries were cake walks compared to Nepal.Even with a tour guide, my trip to Nepal still had its challenges. That being said, I would travel back here in a second; the friendliness of the locals and the beauty of the landscape are incomparable to anywhere else in the world.  Food & Culture in NepalHinduism and Buddhism are the two largest religions in Nepal, but there are also a number of indigenous ethnic groups, mostly rural or nomadic, which have their own traditions and beliefs.Since the large majority of inhabitants are Hindu, there is a strict division of castes and you should be aware of the rules surrounding eating and drinking, such as eating with your right hand, washing your hands before and after meals, and avoiding touching water containers or others’ food when eating in a group. You should also avoid touching others with your left hand.Nepalese food is eaten with the hands, which is why these considerations are so important. Spiced lentils and boiled rice with curry, pickled vegetables, or yoghurt is the national dish, and demonstrates the Nepalese diet’s dependence on spices and rice. Depending on the region, you may also encounter local specialties of fresh fruit, meat and veggie dumplings, and yak products. Due to sanitary concerns, only drink boiled or bottled water and be sure that all food is fresh and thoroughly cooked. Currency: Nepalese Rupee (NPR)  Packing Essentials for Nepal Headlamp: Nepal is the trip that prompted me to ALWAYS keep a headlamp in my carry-on bag. There are power cuts in Nepal that can reach up to 14 hours per day. In addition to fumbling around in the dark in my hotel room, many times I was stuck walking into town in the pitch dark with only the sounds of growling dogs. Come prepared with at least one headlamp and several extra batteries! Comfortable Shoes: Another must-have item! Bring comfortable shoes that can be worn with pants or skirts plus a pair of hiking shoes, if you plan on doing any trekking. Luggage: I don’t recommend bringing wheeled luggage to Nepal; pack light and bring everything in a large framed backpack. If you do bring wheeled luggage, just be prepared to carry it everywhere. The streets are not conducive to wheeled luggage and many of the hotels don’t have elevators. Batteries: Again, bring extra batteries for your headlamp and/or flashlight. Voltage Converter & Adapter: You’ll want a C & D adapter for your electronics and if they cannot handle 220v, then bring a converter too. Clothing: Pack comfortable clothes that can be dressed up or down. For the ladies, I recommend bringing a colorful silk scarf to dress up your outfits, a maxi skirt, fleece-lined leggings to wear under a tunic, and a couple of short and long-sleeved cotton t-shirts to layer. Bring the essentials and leave room in your bag to add some local attire! Hats & Gloves: Bring a pair of gloves (these are fleece-lined and work with all touch screen devices!) and a winter hat if you are traveling in cooler months or if you’ll be doing any hiking.  Things to Do in Nepal Trekking: As previously mentioned, trekking has become a popular tourist activity and is a great way to see the country. From solo “tea-house trekking” to group cultural treks and rigorous peak trekking up Everest and other mountains, there are a number of hiking and backpacking options available. You can either hire local guides or go through a trekking company. Royal Chitwan National Park: The wildlife tours and jungle safaris are not for the faint of heart! You will have the opportunity to see crocodiles, rhinos, birds, monkeys, sloth bear, and possibly even tigers up close. Unless things have changed since we visited the area, we wouldn’t recommend visiting the Elephant Breeding Center; the elephants are chained and don’t seem to be well taken care of. Kathmandu Valley: The valley around Nepal’s capital is full of temples and pilgrimage sites, such as Boudhanath, Pashupatinath, and the famous Monkey Temple. You can book a private day tour which visits all of the main temples for a very reasonable price. Bhaktapur: Bhaktapur is the only place in Nepal which has remained untouched by western culture and it’s recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. Nagarkot: Nagarkot is known as the top spot for amazing Himalayan views right from your hotel! Club Himalaya is one of the best hotels in the area and it offers 360 degree views of these jaw-dropping mountains. Read More:How to Travel Expensive Countries AffordablyThe 12 Most Beautiful Places to Visit in Alberta, CanadaNepal: I See The Light In YouHow to Travel Kauai on a BudgetAffordable Travel Destinations for 2017Top 10 Things To Do In India12 Places to Travel While the U.S. Dollar is Strong "

Even though I really like the color version of some of these photos, I think the black and white version gives them a unique feeling.To give you a little back story about the people in these photos, most of the photos were taken in either Dhading or Bhaktapur. I found that most of the children in Nepal loved getting their photos taken.The one of the young girl with the shawl wrapped around her was not shy at all about asking me to take her photo. Other children would try to get in the picture and she would move away from them, point to herself and say, “Me!” She was very photogenic, as you can see, so most of her photos came out very well. The picture you see here was the closest she ever came to smiling in her photos.I’m not sure why some of the children chose not to smile when a camera was pointed at them, because without a camera around they were full of joy and wide-stretched grins.I would, of course, show everyone the picture in my LCD screen as soon as it was taken and the children would laugh and giggle. The lady in the very top photo gave a squinty look after I showed her this photo as if to say she didn’t like the way she looked. I think she is beautiful.I’m eternally grateful for the kindness these people have shown me and their willingness to open their hearts to me. 10 Photos of Nepal That Will Make You Fall In Love With This Country   Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					        Read More:The Ultimate Nepal Travel Guide + Packing Tips5 Common Travel Photography Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)5 Things You Should Never Forget Before a TripHow to Travel Expensive Countries AffordablyThe Ultimate Packing Guide for Travel Photographers (Tips From a Pro!)20 Best Travel Hacks That Will Save You Money "
https://ordinarytraveler.com/lakh-batti-100000-lights-photo,"Lakh Batti – 100,000 Lights in Nepal",Nepal,"Lakh Batti (Lakh meaning a hundred thousand, and Batti meaning lights) is a Hindu ceremony performed to bring upon divine intervention in order to change the course of one’s life. I was lucky enough to witness one of these ceremonies while at Soyambhu Temple in Kathmandu, Nepal.A purposeful ceremony, devotees produce an offering of lit wicks to worship the deity of their choice, and then come together as a family or community to conduct the ceremony. The ceremony includes lighting the wicks, fasting, dancing, drumming, and eventually feasting. This ceremony is called Lakh Batti (AKA: 100,000 lights) The above photo was taken at Soyambhu Temple in Kathmandu, Nepal. This ceremony is performed for many different reasons in the Hindu religion including; remembering the dead, to change the course of one’s life, to give good fortune, to heal health problems and many other situations.The fire is lit with tiny strings made of cotton (battis) which are soaked in sunflower or some other type of oil. The fire is lit and the healing begins. Photo TipThis shot was taken at a shutter speed of 1/30th. I wanted to show movement in the flames and also wanted to make sure to draw attention to the main subject since there were many people passing through the scene. I wanted the people in the background to be blurry and the main subject to be in focus, which meant I had to catch her when she was completely still.There are other ways of drawing attention to your main subject, such as using a large aperture or using leading lines, but the blur effect is what I was looking for in this photo. There were a few other photos I took where the people in the background had more of a ghosting effect, but I liked this one the best because of the placement of the main subject. Check out our Photography page to purchase postcards and prints of our photos! For more Nepal travel posts, visit these pages:Holy Man in Pashupatinath Temple, Nepal10 Safe Destinations for Solo Female TravelersNepal in Black and WhiteSadhu in KathmanduChildren of Nepal Photo EssayNepal: I See the Light in YouBoat Ride from Hell – Chitwan Nepal Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					"

In front of him lies a pack of smokes and a box of matches.He looks to be sitting on a mat made of straw, which protects his bare feet and legs from the blistering cement.I’m captured by his fluid and tranquil movements.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/nature-walk-from-hell-chitwan-nepal,"Nature Walk from Hell – Chitwan, Nepal",Nepal," Nature Walk from Hell – Chitwan, Nepal This is Part II to my story: Boat Ride from HellOur guide’s safety briefing left me even more confused than if he hadn’t said anything at all regarding what to do if we see each of the deadly animals.Climb a tree to get away from a tiger? Hug a bear? Stare down a rhino? I know my reaction to any of these animals is going to be instinctively screaming and running in the opposite direction, just like the time I encountered a rattlesnake at Joshua Tree National Park. All the safety talks in the world can’t help me when I’m surprised by an animal that can potentially kill me.The best part is when he told us to avoid blinking our eyes when staring down a tiger. Are you kidding me?“The tiger will attack the second you blink your eyes.”Awesome.“Most likely you won’t spot a tiger before it attacks though. They usually stalk their prey from behind.”Well, that makes me feel better. At least now I don’t need to worry about whether or not I’m going to blink.“If we spot a rhino and it begins to charge at us, throw something to distract the animal and run as fast as you can to the nearest tree to climb.”I began scanning the trees around me and imagined myself digging my nails into the trunk in order to climb up since I couldn’t find one that looked easy to climb.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					“If we see a sloth bear, we must gather as a group and stand our ground. Don’t run and don’t climb a tree because the bears are fast and they can climb trees.”Just to give you an idea of what a sloth bear can do to a human, I’ll quote Wikipedia on this one. “The sloth bear is also more inclined to attack man unprovoked than almost any other animal, and casualties inflicted by it are unfortunately very common, the victim being often terribly disfigured even if not killed, as the bear strikes at the head and face. Sloth bears rarely killed their human victims outright, but would suck and chew on their limbs till they were reduced to bloody pulps.”Nice visual, right?Luckily, I didn’t know this before my nature walk from hell, but regardless, it was another animal that I needed to remember how to protect myself from, if necessary.As we set off on our walk, all I could think about was how much I hoped we didn’t see any animals. Most people hope to see something cool on a walk like this, but not me. Thanks to my guide, I preferred to have an extremely boring walk.We stop before a large clearing in the park. Our guide lifts his binoculars to his eyes and silently scans the clearing while the rest of us wait patiently.Did he see a rhino?I look at another person in the group and we both give each other the “huh?” look at the same time and start cracking up. I’m sure we are thinking the same thing. That our guide is leading us into the rhino pit.We continue following our guide, who speedily walks ahead of the rest of the group, along the edge of a large swamp. He is searching for birds or something in the trees. All I am searching for is the camouflaged crocodile that I fear may be lurking near us in the mud.I find the courage to ask our guide, “Have you seen crocodiles here on your previous tours?”“Oh yes, all the time.”I try to laugh it off that this nature walk just keeps getting more and more frightening.“How much longer on this wonderful nature walk?” I sarcastically ask our guide, hoping he will say we are almost there.“We are about halfway now,” he says.I cringe at the thought that we still have halfway to go.All of a sudden, the girl walking behind me tells me to stop immediately. I instantly figure out why and I wait impatiently as she finds the courage to brush the very large insect off my back. My imagination gets carried away and I wonder if it’s a huge spider like the one I found in my hotel room the night before or the one we encountered earlier on the trail.Nope. It turns out it’s just a big weird bug.Our guide then stops along the trail and crouches down to his knees to get a closer look at the ground. He turns to us and says,“Fresh tiger tracks.” Read More:First Impressions of NepalNepal: I See The Light In YouThe Best Luggage BrandsThe Ultimate Nepal Travel Guide + Packing TipsHow to Choose the Best Travel CameraHow to Travel Expensive Countries Affordably "

Each person had to sit down before the other person could set foot in the boat in order to keep balance. Once the first person sat down, our guide then placed a small, wooden seat in front of them for the next person to sit on. Boat Ride from Hell in Chitwan, Nepal I wanted to be the last one on the boat, but of course there was always somebody else in my group who insisted they were helpless and needed to have special treatment. I had already spent ten days with the people in this group and I was a bit apprehensive about trusting them to keep the boat from tipping over.Our guide was the last to pile in the boat and right before take off he has the nerve to say, “Keep your balance or we will tip over.”My muscles tightened as I spent all of my concentration making sure I didn’t move an inch. I didn’t even want to get my camera from my bag. This boat trip would never fly as a tour in the States.Our guide pointed out wildlife as our boat swayed back and forth. I had a hard time enjoying the scenery and kept wondering how long I would have to endure this boat ride.And then my worst nightmare came true.Our guide began pointing out all the crocodiles lounging in the water around us. Now my biggest fear is no longer ruining my camera equipment and photos, but the fact that tipping over could mean slow death by crocodile.The other tourists in the boat began turning their bodies in order to get a better shot of the man-eaters along the shore and in the water causing our boat to rock more aggressively from side to side.Finally, I yelled… “Don’t rock the boat!!”Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Followed by our guide’s calm voice, “Sit still or we will tip over.”All I wanted was for every person in the canoe to stop talking and moving so we could regain our balance.

When our boat docked along the mud embankment, I could finally feel the calming of my heartbeat.I wish I could say that was the extent of my life-threatening experience, but the drama continued.Once on dry land, our guide insisted we gather for a pep talk before we entered the walking part of our tour through the jungle.“Now I want to prepare you for what to do in the event that we are spotted by a rhinoceros, a tiger or a bear.”“Seriously?!

https://ordinarytraveler.com/el-nido-philippines-travel-guide,"The Ultimate Guide to El Nido, Philippines",Philippines,"Located within the stunning and lush mountains of Palawan’s main island, El Nido has been rated one of the most beautiful places in the Philippines. Forget crowded resorts in tourist cities, and escape to tranquil and awe-inspiring El Nido instead. El Nido, Philippines Travel Guide How to Get to El NidoFrom your departing destination, you’ll likely fly to the Philippines’ capital of Manila before making your way to the main island of Palawan. If you are traveling from anywhere other than Asia, your best bet is to stay one night near the airport in Manila before embarking on your island hopper flight to the island of Palawan.Manila is known as one of the busiest airports in the world, and, in turn, I was recommended to allot at least three hours to switch terminals or get to nearby airport hotels. I was relieved to find it only took about 30 minutes to get from the international terminal to the Salem Airport Guesthouse (the closest airport hotel I could find) which was less than a mile away. However, that was after waiting nearly an hour for our shuttle driver to arrive.The easiest and quickest way to travel from Manila to El Nido is on a direct Air Swift flight which will set you back about $200-$300 US. If you’re on a budget, you can also fly with Cebu Pacific to Puerto Princessa and hop on a 6-hour shuttle ride to El Nido.When flying out of the domestic terminal in Manila, make sure to print your boarding pass or have the email confirmation readily available before you arrive at the terminal. They take security seriously and will not let anybody through without proof of a flight.When leaving El Nido, I flew back into Manila with Air Swift and they provided a transfer from the domestic terminal (Terminal 4) to the international (Terminal 3) which avoided the airport traffic chaos. Again, although you might save time with a transfer bus, it would be smart to play it safe and allow at least three hours between your island flight and your international flight home. What To Do in El NidoJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Island hopping! Skipper Charters offers both private and group charters to some of the most beautiful and photogenic places in Palawan. A few favorites in the Bacuit Archipelago include Small Lagoon, Big Lagoon, Snake Island and Pinagbuyatan.The Open Tours — with small groups of six — are a great opportunity to socialize and they’re perfect for budget travelers. A full day tour with food and snorkeling costs approximately $70 USD per person. Private tours are better for groups who want to explore on their own schedule and like to get away from the crowds. Weather permitting, they also offer day trips to nearby Coron on a speedboat.Nacpan Beach on El Nido’s main island is another must-see as it has a reputation for being one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. On your hike through the jungle to the beach, you can also stop at Nagkalit-Kalit Falls to take a dip in the water and snap a few pictures under the falls.You’ll likely spend your days island hopping, exploring sea caves, kayaking or snorkeling, but if you want to see more of the island, you can rent bicycles or motorbikes to explore on your own or book a car and driver for the day. Where to Stay in El NidoThe Salem Airport Guesthouse is a great budget option close to the airport in Manila.  They also offer airport transfer for 200 PHP — about $4 USD — each way per person, which saves you the hassle of dealing with taxis. If you don’t mind paying a little more for added comfort, the medium range Marriott is also within close proximity to the airport.Within El Nido, the Spin Designer Hostel right in downtown is the perfect budget option for solo travelers, couples or groups of friends traveling together. The guards on the property pay attention to who comes and goes, making this an extremely safe place — especially for solo travelers. The friendliness of the staff, cleanliness, and the location really makes this place one of my top stays in El Nido.For luxury getaways, I would highly recommend El Nido Resorts Miniloc Island. Picturesque water bungalows are a favorite here and the hotel’s all-inclusive amenities include three meals per day, transportation to and from the airport, snorkel equipment, kayak rentals, and daily boat tours around the archipelago. In addition to the standard activities provided, splurge a little and treat yourself to one of their spa massages.NoaNoa Island is another luxe option for couples or groups (a group of friends or large family can rent out the entire island!). It’s a quick boat trip from TayTay, not El Nido, so plan your day trips and activities accordingly. The gorgeous location, secluded from tourists and surrounded by a coral reef sanctuary, make this a perfect honeymoon destination or romantic getaway. Philippines Packing Essentials!Swimsuit Cover Up: Ladies, you’ll want to bring one or two of these if you plan on spending your time on the beach or island hopping! Silica Packs: When I visited in October, it was HUMID! Humidity can wreak havoc on your electronics, so bring a few silica packs along with several large ziplock bags to keep your equipment dry. Swimwear: Bring at least two to three sets of swimwear; there’s nothing worse than putting on a wet swimsuit! I always bring a rashguard for sun protection while snorkeling too. Water Shoes: It’s always a good idea to have a pair of water shoes in your bag along with a couple pairs of comfortable flip flops. Don’t count on buying a pair when you get there unless you have extremely tiny feet! Dry Bag: A dry bag will keep all of our electronics dry while island hopping, kayaking, or traveling from one island resort to another. You can choose from 5L to 55L — depending on your needs. Underwater Camera: I highly recommend bringing a GoPro for underwater photos (and a selfie stick!) and a nice camera for land activities.

Public buses, boats, trams, and ferries offer a cheap way to do and see a lot without worrying about driving in a strange and busy city. Not only that, the Gothenburg City Card offers one, two, and three-day passes for unlimited use of public transportation. Read more: 10 Best Islands to Visit in West Sweden 7. It’s Not Too BigEven as Sweden’s second largest city, it’s incredibly walkable; and since it’s got about two-fifths of Stockholm’s population in a relatively equivalent urban area, it’s not too dense, either. Once you reach Kungsportsavenyn, you’ll find easy access to both points of interest and most conveniences you’d need. 8. Liseberg Amusement ParkThe city’s number one attraction is this roller coaster park in easy access of downtown. Over three million European visitors come between July and the end of December each year, and its wooden roller coaster, Balder, has been voted the World’s Best Wooden Roller Coaster twice. 9. It’s Bike FriendlyNot only does the city’s Congestion Fare keep the roadways safer for bikers by regulating the amount of traffic during weekdays, and the City Card include a bike rental option, but the popularity of biking is also driven by the number of urban, woodland, lake, and seaside trails in the area. 10. The NightlifeA little something for everybody! If you like clubbing, PUSH on the main thoroughfare combines house & disco with open-aired terraces. Craft beer and live music more your scene? Nefertiti offers nightly jazz, and The Rover, with over 32 different beers on tap, is a local favorite. Plan Your Trip to SwedenAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/top-travel-tips-sweden,Sweden Travel Tips: 7 Things You Need to Know,Sweden,"These Sweden travel tips cover the top things you need to know when traveling to Sweden — from saving money to attractions you won’t want to miss!Ice floes and rocky shores, quiet forests and the northern lights — Sweden is a beautiful country that attracts more than five-million tourists per year. We just returned from our first trip to West Sweden and since we didn’t do much research before we departed, we were both in for a few surprises.Keep these Sweden travel tips in mind while planning your trip to this Scandinavian country.  Here are 7 things you need to know when visiting Sweden! Sweden Travel Tips: 7 Things You Need to Know You won’t be able to pronounce the names of places, but that’s okay.Every time we thought we had the pronunciation of a word correct, we still managed to butcher it when talking to locals. Thankfully, even if you can’t wrap your tongue around the Swedish language, you can still travel easily in Sweden.Outside of native anglophone countries, Sweden consistently have one of the largest and most fluent English speaking populations in Europe! Thanks to early-education English courses and the popularity of English speaking movies and television shows, communication becomes much easier than you might expect traveling in a foreign country. Island-hopping is a must.Sweden’s coast is dotted with thousands of islands that can either be reached by car or ferry. For many travelers, hopping through the islands is a great way to enjoy not only the amazing scenery but also to experience the quaint peace of the local hamlets. There is an alcohol monopoly.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					If you’re looking to buy alcohol (above about 3%) outside of a restaurant or bar, you’ll have to find the nearest Systembolaget — a government owned and run retail chain that is the only legal option for buying take-home booze in Sweden. This system of alcohol sale was enacted in 1905 during the prohibition movement to reduce both price gouging and overconsumption.We definitely missed the closing hours of these stores a few times during our trip (some close at 6pm) and there can be a long line, depending on when you go. Our advice? Plan ahead and bring some alcohol from home. It will be less expensive and you won’t have to search for one of these stores when you should be enjoying your vacation. Floating saunas are awesome!Not sure whether to go for a swim or head to the spa? Why not both? Sweden’s floating saunas are steam rooms built on pontoon-like barges, allowing you to spend a relaxing day on the lake, ocean, or river in style. These steam rooms have become incredibly popular in Sweden and bring an all-new level to your island-hopping vacation. Tap water is better than bottled water.It’s the social, ecological, and financial norm to drink water straight from the tap. Sweden’s water supply is well filtered and incredibly clean, so the majority of the environmentally-conscious country’s citizens choose to pass on drinking water from plastic bottles. The same goes for using both plastic and paper bags at the grocery, so if you want to avoid having to pay for them, bring your own bag. The speed limits change constantly!In 2008, Sweden introduced new speed signs to their roads and highways. While before this year the standard speeds were 30, 50, 70, and 110km/h, the areas between these speed changes had even-interval halfway km/h signs added to encourage a more gradual change in speed. Keep your eyes open for these signs, as they change often. There’s no shortage of seafood.As a coastal and island-heavy country, Swedes love their fish! Caviar, lutfisk, herring, surstrӧmming—a number of fishy specialties make Sweden a smorgasbord for seafood lovers. If you’re not an adventurous eater, don’t worry — the variety means you’ll still find something you like. Come with an open mind and you’ll leave with a full stomach.When we travel, we love to craft our journey with different kinds of food, and this means trying almost anything. Sweden definitely allowed us to be adventurous when it came to the cuisine. I’m not normally a huge fan of fish so having fish every day felt a little strange at first, but all of the fish dishes tasted extremely fresh.Our favorite meal of the trip included baked cod smothered in a carrot puree and a light shellfish sauce. Even if you don’t love fish, I highly recommend trying it in Sweden.  Sweden Packing Essentials  Winter Gear: If you plan on visiting in the winter months, then it’s best to load up with the best cold-weather gear. We recommend a plush down jacket, a heavy-duty pair of gloves or mittens, and a thick beanie that will cover your ears!  Layers: No matter what time of year you visit Sweden, packing layers is a must. In the winter, or if you are headed to Northern Sweden, plan to pack items such as fleece-lined leggings, thermal underwear, and a moisture-wicking base top to keep you warm and dry. Likewise in the summertime, think camisoles and cardigans, and no matter what the forecast says, it’s always smart to pack a pashmina!  Waterproof Gear: The only thing worse than being cold is being cold and wet! Make sure you invest in some quality water-resistant shoes or boots, a raincoat for the summer months, a rain cover for your backpack, some waterproof pants, and a windproof travel umbrella.  Sun Protection: Sunscreen and a pair of sunglasses are two essentials I never leave home without!  Swim Gear: Whether you’re headed to the lake in the summer or feel like indulging in a sauna break, make sure you bring along a swimsuit (this is my new favorite one-piece!) and a quick-drying towel. Plan Your Trip to SwedenAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights:Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

Volvo offers a great program that allows Americans to purchase a new Volvo directly from Sweden at a significant savings. The best part? You get two free tickets to Sweden!In order to bring attention to this program, Volvo and Visit Sweden asked us to experience a road trip through West Sweden to help travelers discover the best that the area has to offer. We visited the Volvo factory in Gothenburg and met with quite a few Americans who were traveling to Sweden to purchase their new car. We even met a couple from San Francisco at the airport who were doing the same thing!Some of the people we met had already done this once before and they were on their second round of purchasing a new Volvo in Sweden, years later. It was an interesting experience for us. If we were in the market for a new car, this would be a no brainer.We stayed in a new location every night during our time in West Sweden, so we were able to see as much as possible during our five days along the Bohuslan coast. Our trip coincided with Midsummer, so we had the opportunity to experience this Swedish tradition at Villa Sjotorp — pickled herring and all. I highly recommend a road trip through this area even if you are not in the market for a new car. It’s one of the prettiest coastlines we have visited.Here is our road trip guide through the Bohuslan Coast of Sweden! Island Hopping Along the Bohuslan Coast of Sweden KladesholmenOur first stop was the tiny island of Kladesholmen, which is connected by a bridge to the larger island of Tjorn. We arrived at the Salt & Sill — Sweden’s first floating hotel — and checked into our quaint sea-view room on the bottom floor of the hotel.It was a rainy afternoon, so we took full advantage of the floating sauna just a few steps from our room. If it had been sunny, we would have loved to rent kayaks from the front desk and explore this area from the water. A few of our neighbors didn’t let the rain stop them from jumping into the sea and warming up in the sauna.

Our room had a view of the island and was just a short walk to the ferry terminal.Things to do on Marstrand include shopping, a visit to Strandverket and Carlsten fortress, and hiking around the island. There’s plenty of restaurants to choose from on the island, but we highly recommend making reservations for dinner at Grand Hotel. Their crayfish was simply amazing! Read more: 7 Things You Should Know Before You Visit Sweden TjornTjorn is the sixth largest island in Sweden, near the island of Orust. One of the things we were looking forward to the most during our visit to this country was an afternoon with Meet the Swedes. Meet the Swedes is an organization for small companies who offer accommodation and are happy to give their guests a glimpse inside their lives. This gives travelers the opportunity to meet locals and learn about their way of life.We met with Elisabeth and Bengt at their home on the island of Tjorn. They run a small farm and guesthouse (Turnips & Rooms) in Toftenas, where Elisabeth’s family has lived for several generations. We weren’t sure what to expect as we didn’t make any specific plans for activities, but knew we could choose between a boat ride, hiking, archery, or a BBQ.Elisabeth suggested a walk through the nearby nature reserve with a stop to feed their sheep. As we walked — passing cows, colorful houses, and a couple of swans — she talked about her family, their life in rural Sweden, and a bit of the history behind the upcoming Midsummer tradition. Read more: How to Travel in Norway on a BudgetHer husband, Bengt had lunch waiting for us once we returned to their home. He had prepared a traditional Swedish meal of pickled herring, delicious Swedish sausage, potatoes from their garden, and fresh strawberries for dessert.

Learning more about Sweden’s culture and history gave us more of an appreciation for this wonderful country and its people. Plan Your Trip to SwedenAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/west-sweden-adventure,We’re Traveling to Western Sweden!,Sweden,"We have a close friend who grew up in Sweden and from the day we met him it’s been one story after another about his amazing country. He’s a bit of a “let me tell you a grand tale” type of guy, which makes his stories even more intriguing. We’ve heard about breathtaking waterways, exciting city night life, tasty cuisine, and a few experiences that I can’t mention in this post.Having someone like this in our lives has definitely added a new dimension to our world view. Aside from introducing us to fish sauce in a tube, he’s really fostered our excitement and curiosity about this country.A couple of months ago, we were approached by West Sweden and Volvo to take part in their Gothenburg and West Sweden In a Volvo campaign. We jumped at the chance to explore this country and we will departing on our adventure in mid June!So what are we going to do while we’re there? We will be driving around Western Sweden in a brand new Volvo, visiting Gothenburg, hiking, taking part in a midsummer celebration, learning about the Swedish lifestyle, and exploring Marstrand. Gothenburg Canals & ArchipelagoWhile I’m sure it’s a bit different from the canals of Venice, we’re excited to take a tour of Gothenburg’s gorgeous canals. The buildings and trees extending into the air along the canal show off the architecture of the city and create those mirror-like water reflections we love to photograph. While in Gothenburg, we will also be visiting the famous Upper House Spa. West SwedenIt’s usually not an epic trip for us unless we visit at least one island. I don’t know what it is with us and our addiction to being surrounded by water — especially since I have a deep-seeded fear of drowning alone in a cold ocean — but we can’t leave Sweden without exploring some islands.West Sweden is dotted with islands all the way to Norway. Here’s the plan: eat plenty of fresh, mouthwatering seafood, hike with a local Swede, and take in those beaming red houses along the coastline that make your pictures pop!What else will we do in Sweden? Well, some of our itinerary is still up in the air, so we’re at the mercy of our Swedish hosts. I know they will show us a good time, but it sure would be amazing if we could see a moose (hint, hint). No pressure.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/best-islands-to-visit-thailand,10 Best Islands to Visit in Thailand,Thailand,"Thailand is known for its big city, Bangkok, but the country’s white-beach islands have just as much culture, fun, and relaxation to offer. Spend a few days soaking up the experiences of one, and then keep things fresh by simply “island hopping” to another. It’s easy and can be done on a budget.Visiting off-season, after April and through October, is very inexpensive. The best weather is during the shoulder seasons: May – June, then October. There’s some heat, but you’ll avoid monsoon season.Take the public ferries between islands to save cash; larger islands also have airports and flying domestic can be even cheaper. Avoid eating at resort restaurants if you’re looking for low prices and incredible local flavor; small restaurants and street vendors offer the most authentic experience.When planning where to stay, check hotel booking sites like Booking.com (our personal favorite) to get the best prices. Some places close during the off-season so it’s best to check ahead, but even beautiful resorts will be inexpensive during that time. Here are 10 of the best islands to visit in Thailand: Koh PhanganBest known for its wild Full Moon Party on its southern beaches– thousands of people come together to let their hair down at this party! If partying under the full moon isn’t your thing, the island is quiet and relaxing at other times of the month, and the northern beaches are calmer. The Haad Yao Bayview Resort & Spa is both friendly & affordable.Read more: Koh Phangan — It’s More than Just a Party Island Ko TaoNamed for its shore-lounging sea turtles, Ko Tao is best known for its 30+ dive sites and affordable scuba certification.

Sadly, rapid development has left Ko Lipe worse for wear; it’s crowded and not uncommon to see garbage piles being burnt for lack of proper disposal options. Ko Yao YaiA wonderful destination for enjoying the peace and quiet of nature, it has been preserved from development by its friendly local people. Many of them are Muslim, so it’s respectful to wear more modest clothing away from the beaches, but you’ll be warmly welcomed to this enchanting island. Ko LantaKo Lanta offers good swimming, kayaking, and plenty of places to eat, play, and get a massage. It’s well-developed with good roads and has accommodations appropriate for those who enjoy high-end resorts, backpackers who like to rough it, and everyone in between. Ko SametIt’s a quick trip to this island from the mainland, making it a popular weekend getaway from Bangkok, but remains lushly green despite that. It sports pristine beaches and crystal waters with just enough development to be comfortable. Ko ChangA great destination for rugged adventurers, Ko Chang has jungle peaks and plenty of wildlife. It’s got great snorkeling and diving as well, and a lively party scene for those who seek one. Koh Phi PhiOne of the most popular destinations due to its gorgeous beaches and jungles, the island is a party paradise for people who don’t mind crowds. It also has some accommodations—like ATMs—that the smaller islands lack. Koh RachaIt’s actually two islands! Racha Yai offers places to stay in bungalows or resorts. Racha Noi has no accommodations but is a great place to dive and bask in nature. Both have great beaches. For more information about Southeast Asia, visit our travel guides:Thailand Travel GuideLaos Travel GuideVietnam Travel GuideBali Travel Guide7 Best Places to Visit in Southeast Asia Photo Credit: Mark Fischer"

https://ordinarytraveler.com/an-island-fit-for-kings-koh-phangan,Koh Phangan – It’s More Than Just a Party Island,Thailand,"Koh Phangan has been a popular destination throughout the years for many kings of Thailand. Between 1888 and 1909, the king of Siam visited the island over a dozen times and carved his name in the rocks at Than Sadet, also known as “The Royal Stream”. Today, Koh Phangan is one of the top places to visit in Southeast Asia. Koh Phangan Travel TipsWe did not even consider visiting this Thai island until the receptionist at Rico’s Bungalows in Kata Beach, informed us there was much more to it than a full moon party destination. My idea of a good time these days is not getting smashed with a bunch of strangers while hoping I don’t get rufied. I’m not saying there is anything wrong with people who go for the full moon parties, it’s just not our cup of tea anymore. It’s weird, as I get older, I seem to enjoy crowds less and less. How to Get to Koh PhanganOn our way out of Kata, in Phuket, we decided to ask the best way to reach Koh Phangan. Unfortunately, the receptionist who had been so helpful in the past was gone, so we asked the girl that was in her place. Following her direction, we showed up at Chalong Harbor ready to take a ferry all the way to the island. As soon as we arrived, we spoke with a man who had worked there 14 years and he explained there has never been a ferry to Koh Phangan from this harbor.We took the $1 bus to Old Town to catch the 6 hour bus ride to Surat Thani for $6 each, which was less than our useless taxi ride to Chalong Harbor.We made our way north to Surat on a local bus with no AC, a clock about 8 hours fast and a broken English sign that read “Please not food eat on bus.” That of course didn’t stop the locals from coming on and selling us fruit and other treats. Right after we passed the gorgeous limestone mountains of Khao Sok National Park, our bus started skidding in the rain soaked street. After about 20 seconds, we came to a stop and thought for sure we had a flat judging by the smell of burning rubber. Five minutes later, the driver started the bus and continued on with no explanation. That’s Southeast Asia for you! Ferry to Koh PhanganWe arrived into the ferry station in Surat at 7:30pm and our ferry didn’t leave until 11pm. To pass the time, we enjoyed some Pad Thai from a street vendor and chugged a couple of beers to calm our nerves for what awaited next. The ferry that would take us the 6 hours to the island of Koh Phangan, was a small, old, wooden boat.Have you ever wondered what it feels like to live inside the props of a miniature golf course? These are precisely the thoughts that entered my mind as we crouched through cramped quarters of the two story boat, like giants in a miniature house. The air was thick with pungent smells of sweat and freshly captured fish.The second level of the small ferry had nearly fifty mats laid across the floor on each side, and about 2 life jackets for every 8 people. We claimed two mats, which would be our sleeping arrangements for the night. It wasn’t long before I had drifted into a sleep filled with dreams of sun-kissed islands and translucent blue-green seawater.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The next thing we knew it was 5 am and we were docking at Thong Sala Harbor where there were many taxis eagerly awaiting our arrival. Unfortunately, the hotel we had booked ahead of time and paid in full, The Central Cottage, turned out to be quite a trek. About an hour down a bumpy road and a 1000 baht taxi fare is what we were told, so we reluctantly decided to take the closer alternative for only a 150 baht taxi ride. Haad Yao HotelAfter just 15 minutes on a paved road, we were at the Haad Yao Bayview Resort & Spa and checking into our 500 Baht bungalow, only steps from the beach. Haad Yao Hotel was a very nice place to stay with a super friendly and helpful staff.We instantly got on our suits and took the path to the secluded beach in front of our hotel. We were literally the only people around besides the hotel staff since it was still 6 am. This was indeed paradise. The water was as calm as a lake and crystal clear. It was high tide, so you could walk out to about waist deep, until you hit the coral and could no longer pass. This side of the island is not known for it’s swimming beaches because of the coral at low tide.If you are looking for swimming beaches, you can try the southern beaches near Haad Rin or the north east beaches, where we had originally booked our hotel, The Central Cottage. There is also a legendary waterfall on the sunrise side of the island (north east side).The island itself has some windy roads, but with a motorbike, (200 baht) you are able to see much of the island. We rented a bike for the day and we were able to see the entire west coast of the island and used only a quarter of a liter of gas. The two liters we filled up with would have probably lasted a week.We considered staying another day on the island, but decided it was better to get an early start on our journey to Laos. Back on the ferry, we stopped on the island of Ko Tao to pick up some passengers, and arrived 4 hours later in Chumphon to await the arrival of our bus to Bangkok."
https://ordinarytraveler.com/head-highs-banana-pancakes-gorgeous-islands-southern-thailand,"Head Highs, Banana Pancakes & Gorgeous Islands – Southern Thailand",Thailand,"Since traveling through Australia felt like we hadn’t left the United States, we were pretty excited at the thought of experiencing some culture in Southeast Asia. Australia to PhuketAfter 10 grueling hours at Brisbane airport we eagerly boarded our 2.5 hour flight to Melbourne, caught some more zzz’s, then rushed through the Melbourne domestic terminal to the international terminal with a few minutes to spare before we got on our 8 hr flight to Phuket.Four and a half in flight movies later, we were descending toward clear, turquoise waters. Then just 500 baht to catch a taxi to Old Town Phuket. A word of warning, just because you have an address and phone number to your hotel it does not mean it will be easy for your taxi driver to get you there. After asking everyone he knows and numerous failed attempts to call our hotel, our taxi driver was noticeably irritated. Old Town PhuketLuckily the hotel answered the phone just before he was about to drop us off at the nearest street corner in a city where we felt like complete gringos. Old Town Phuket has minimal tourists, we found out upon arriving at the Old Town Phuket Hostel, where the receptionist spoke very little, and I mean very little, English. I do realize I’m in a foreign country and i do not mean to sound like an ignorant American, but I simply was not prepared. Our room was nice enough for 450 baht, and we were happy to get a good nights rest.The next morning we got an early start to try to avoid carrying our bags during the hottest part of the day. On our walk to the bus stop we were lucky enough to see the local weekend market in town. Their standard of food cleanliness does not compare to the western world. The most intriguing food stall was all the different kinds of meat sitting out in the sun and heat with no case or cover for the flies to have a field day. After checking out the market, we hopped on the local bus to Kata Beach for just 30 baht each. Kata BeachThe bus station in Kata is right on the beach and only steps away from many choices of accommodation. We spent about thirty minutes in the hot sun looking for something cheaper than $27 US per night, only to find that most places were more expensive. We settled finally at Rico’s Bungalows since it had a pool.Each of the bungalows surrounded the pool and they were quite luxurious for our standards. And the hotel staff were very helpful when it came to any questions we had about Thailand.We stayed in Kata Beach for three days, and we were lucky enough to have waist to head high surf every day at Kata Beach. Since we had just come from Australia where everything is expensive, we were more than happy to pay $3-5 US per hour to rent a surfboard. On the way back from the beach you can buy freshly made crepes with your choice of fruits, jams and other sweets. We usually enjoyed the banana Nutella, and they were awesome after a good surf session!Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					Kata is a bit touristy and not exactly a place that you will meet many backpackers. It is more of a destination vacation for people who have no problem spending a lot of money. But you can find a few cheap places to eat if you are willing to search them out.The Orchid, on the main street of Kata, has cheap and delicious Thai dishes with a large menu to choose from. Also, don’t knock it, but we found 7 Eleven to be a great place for muffins in the morning and rice burgers for lunch. They lure you in with their inviting air conditioning since most restaurants only have fans. And when it is 95 degrees and humid, A/C starts to sound like heaven. Raya IslandOn our second day in Kata, we took a tour to Raya Island. It was about $40 US per person with Raya Father Tours. The snorkeling was amazing along with the lunch that was included at one of the restaurants on the island. We spent the rest of the day chillin at the Reggae bar on the beach or exploring along the cliffs.There are some beautiful and exotic wildlife on the island including large Iguanas and birds that looked like Hawks. I wouldn’t say Raya is uncrowded, but compared to Phi Phi or James Bond Island, it is deserted. Thai Massage in PhuketAfter all that beach play and a long two weeks prior of sleeping in the equivalent of a minivan, it was time for a relaxing Thai massage. We found a place next to our hotel for 200 baht each and they set us up in the same room, side by side. Everything was great until the very end of the massage when the therapist did a jerky back side bend that instantly left me sobbing from the pain.I couldn’t speak and I was embarrassed that I couldn’t stop crying. After the staff realized what was going on, a different lady came in with a jar of red balm and massaged my spasming muscles. The pain didn’t ease that night, so she told me I could come in the next day and she would work on the spot again if I wasn’t feeling better.Needless to say, I’m a bit leery of massages in Thailand after this experience! Our plan was to leave early the next morning to catch the 9am bus to Koh Phangan. Since I wasn’t feeling better in the morning, we waited until later in the afternoon and took the more difficult and longer route to the island. Have you been to the south of Thailand? If so, what was your favorite spot?"
https://ordinarytraveler.com/the-kiteboarding-mecca-of-southeast-asia-mui-ne,Mui Ne Travel Guide: The Kiteboarding Mecca of Southeast Asia,Vietnam,"This Mui Ne travel guide covers all of the essentials — where to eat, the best things to do, where to stay, how to get there and more! Mui Ne: The Kiteboarding Mecca of Southeast Asia Sleeper Bus to Mui NeSince we had already experienced the trains in Vietnam on our journey to China Beach, we decided to take the more adventurous route of a sleeper bus as our transportation to Mui Ne.These buses are nothing like the sleeper buses in Thailand. The seats are actually beds, instead of seats that recline. It was surprisingly comfortable as long as you don’t let your mind wonder how many people have slept on your bed without any sheets.The 16 hour bus ride flew by for us and was actually cheaper and faster than taking the train. Just to be clear, these beds are not made for exceptionally tall people. If you are 5’6 or shorter, you will sleep fine in one of the beds. However, if you are taller than that, you may feel a bit cramped unless you are lucky enough to get a bus that is not crowded so you can stretch out on two beds.Also, if you are a light sleeper you may be constantly abruptly awoken by the sound of loud horns or the shaking of the bus as it speeds over bumpy, unfinished roads. This is all a part of the adventure though, right!?I’m not going to lie, after the 16 hour bus ride we were a bit tired and grumpy by the time we arrived in Mui Ne. We had picked out a couple of hotels from our guide book, but we found out soon enough that Mui Ne is not easy to get around by foot especially when you are walking with heavy bags at the hottest part of the day.We also discovered, amidst being covered with buckets of our own sweat, that Mui Ne is mostly for families who come to enjoy the beach and are ready to drop some cash, or credit cards in this case.There are a few accommodation options for backpackers, but we found out later that they are on the Southern end of the town where most of the locals live. This is normally where we would have stayed, and without complaint, but since these were our last 2 days of a 6 week trip, we decided to keep the theme from Hoi An going and get a place with a pool. The hotels with pools started at about $40/night because many of them are right on the beach. Tien Dat ResortJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					We were drawn to a lovely resort named Tien Dat because of it’s inviting pool overlooking the ocean, complete with kiddie slides and a waterfall. It was fairly quiet and several times we managed to have the pool all to ourselves. The $40/night included a delectable buffet breakfast that included crossing guards who stopped traffic for guests to get to and from the restaurant in the morning. I certainly could have used these crossing guards in Hanoi! Where to Eat in Mui NeThere are quite a few impressive bars along the strip of Mui Ne, some with pools that light up at night. If you are looking for exotic nightlife, you will definitely find it here. You can walk along the strip of resorts and find little jewels of clubs and restaurants that make you feel like you are in the fanciest club in New York or Los Angeles.Our personal favorite is a bar/restaurant named Jibe’s. This place has it all. Kitesurfing rentals, a pool table, a cushy bar, and couches with tables to enjoy some of their delectable cuisines while listening to the sounds of the ocean.Another of our preferred restaurants was just a few steps away from our resort. It was called, “The Most Popular Restaurant”, and for good reason. Very inexpensive American, Thai and Vietnamese cuisine that included banana pancakes to die for, fried chicken, fruit shakes, fried noodles, cheap Vietnamese beer and, of course, a view of the sand and serene, blue ocean.One word of caution while trying out different budget restaurants in Mui Ne. We went to a little place not far from our resort and ordered a hamburger. After the food came I cut it in half and noticed the meat looked a little mushy, almost the consistency of an uncooked veggie burger.We sent it back, thinking it just needed more time on the grill, and asked them to cook it longer. It came back and after each of us took one bite, we knew something was off. The meat still appeared to be doughy and cooking it longer did not change the taste or the consistency. I suggested we did not eat anymore of it just in case it would make us sick.At first I thought it was just beef that had been sitting around too long, but afterward I realized it might have actually been some kind of mystery meat. Either dog, rat, cat… who knows! Mui Ne Sand DunesNow it was time to take a tour to the legendary Mui Ne Sand Dunes. We booked a tour for $10 each through Sinh Cafe, a honest tour company that is very popular with travelers all over Vietnam. They picked us up in a mini-bus with about 8 other tourists.Our first stop was the Phan Thiet fishing village where we took pictures of the colorful boats, while holding our noses to avoid the overwhelming smell of rotten fish. Our second stop was the Yellow Sand Dunes and White Lake about 1/2 hours drive, where you can rent home-made plastic sand sleds from the local kids and slide down the mounds of sand. The shallower ends of the lake are covered in stunning lotuses and the entire scene is picturesque. Last stop, after you are sufficiently tired, is the White Sand Dunes where you watch the sun set over the sand. Bus from Mui Ne to SaigonAfter relaxing and playing in the pool for two days in Mui Ne, we were finally ready to head to Saigon to catch our midnight flight into Narita, Japan. The easiest option to get to Saigon was the bus that departed at 1 pm from our hotel, which we also booked through Sinh Cafe.We spent most of the ride with our noses in our books, until our bus suddenly skidded to a halt that sent the passengers flying into the seat in front of them. We could smell burning rubber and since we were at the very back of the bus we were able to look behind us to see what all the commotion was about. All we could see was a girl laying on the ground with her motorbike on top of her. It looked as if she had no legs. I started to panic that our bus had run over her legs!After what seemed like an eternity, she slowly got up from the street and it appeared that she was not injured, just very shocked. Our bus driver got out and I thought for sure he wanted to ask her if she was okay. To our surprise, he began yelling at her and at another motorbike driver. The yelling went on back and forth for about 5 minutes in Vietnamese. I cringed at the possibility of our bus driver being overtaken by the crowd that was quickly forming.Finally, our bus driver turned around and got back on the bus, leaving the screaming crowd and injured behind. I couldn’t shake that scene from my mind the rest of the bus ride, and the outcome for me was realizing how lucky I am to live in a place where people seem to care when they hit someone on the road.Saigon was a short visit, just long enough to get a bite to eat and walk around the crowded street near Sinh Cafe. Around 8 pm, we caught a taxi to the airport and got ready for the next 30 hours to be filled with 2 flights, a layover in Japan, a bus, a train and a taxi, to finally be home in our bed."
https://ordinarytraveler.com/hoi-an-vietnam,"Hoi An, Vietnam Travel Guide",Vietnam," Hoi An, Vietnam Travel GuideHoi An is a place that can put your senses on overload. We found this city to be intensely charming and full of life. The city is brimming with lavish hotels accompanying pools, intoxicating aromas from restaurants serving every type of cuisine imaginable, and prowling shopkeepers looking for their next sale. You better get used to the phrase, “you buy!”The shopkeepers show no mercy when they see foreigners walking through town, they even follow you with motorbikes and beg you to come to their stores! Things To Do in Hoi AnIf shopping is your passion, then Hoi An may be the place for you. You can bargain your way to happiness. If your desire is to sample foods from every continent, Hoi An will not disappoint foodies.We tasted some exceptional cuisine while visiting this energetic city. A favorite of ours was the little Italian Restaurant, Don Tien. In addition to the fish, pasta and dessert dishes that transported us back to Italy, we also learned that the owner hires only young Vietnamese who come from a disadvantaged background, including orphans, and this good deed gave the Don Tien restaurant another plus in our book. We dined on mouth watering Seabass with Tomato Coulis for just $4.50 US and finished it off with savory deep fried ice cream.Another highlight of Hoi An is the river at sunset. You can hire either a motor boat or paddle boat with driver to take you wherever your heart desires for only $5 US. This was a much cheaper option to the $70 US sunset cruise we had considered booking previously. We had our own private boat and the close-mouthed driver slowed down every time he noticed us taking pictures.On this particular night the sky was covered in a rich, crimson-orange afterglow from the setting sun. At one point, we stopped for our driver to say hello to a friend of his who was fishing. The fisherman swung his net around and around in the air and finally cast it into the river. He could tell we were in awe at the beauty and technique at which he launched his fishing net and he offered to do it again so we could take pictures.After he caught a couple of fish in his net, he paddled over to our boat and asked for $1. That is when we became aware that taking pictures in Vietnam is not always free! My Son Temples Near Hoi AnMany people who stay in Hoi An also visit the My Son Temples (pronounced Mi Sun) located near the village of Duy Phu. The My Son Temples are a 45-60 minute ride from the town of Hoi An. You can book a tour for $4 per person. Some compare the temples to Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the Borobudur of Java in Indonesia and Ayutthaya of Thailand.Join 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The cluster of about 70 temples date back to a period between the 4th century and the 14th century A.D. It is astonishing how these temples are still standing after numerous centuries. A few of the temples were damaged during the Vietnam war and you can still see large craters from the bombs. Temperatures at My Son can reach upwards of 110 degrees Fahrenheit and it is extremely humid, so come prepared with sunblock, hats and maybe even a change of clothes. An Phu HotelWe also found Hoi An to be the perfect place to relax. There are a plethora of extravagant hotels where you can let yourself be pampered or just cool off and enjoy poolside massages. After 4 weeks of boiling temperatures while backpacking through South East Asia and staying in less than par hostels with no A/C, we splurged in Hoi An and stayed at the An Phu Hotel for $18/night.In the United States a place such as An Phu would probably cost around $500/night. They have a pool, like many of their competitors, and a spa right by the pool that offered pedicures, facials, and massages starting at $6. Hoi An Street MarketWhile visiting Hoi An, you cannot miss the street market where local vendors set up booths under the shade of tarps from early morning till dusk. The vendors sell trinkets, table runners, scarves, hand made lamps, hats, and food. It’s a great place to buy South East Asian fruit, such as our personal favorite, the mangosteen.At first glance, mangosteen looks similar to a beet. Actually, the first time we bought this fruit we ended up throwing it away because we thought it WAS a beet and had no way to cook it. The second time around we were a little wiser, thanks to some fellow travelers we met, and we realized what we had been missing. By pressing down on top of the fruit’s hard outer shell, you can loosen the skin and begin to peel away the outer layer.What you are left with is a small white colored fruit that looks a bit like an orange and is sectioned in the same way. The flavor of this round, purple fruit does not compare to any fruit we have available in the United States. The divine flavor ranges from strawberry, peach and vanilla ice cream with a very slight sourness. I wish we had discovered this fruit earlier in our trip so that we could have been enjoying it the entire time!One of our purchases from this outdoor market included two traditional Asian straw hats. We got tired of the scorching sun and decided this hat was the best thing to keep our faces and shoulders from getting fried. As we were trying on these hats, a few elderly Vietnamese woman made it known how ridiculous they felt we looked in them. It was very amusing and I absolutely have to agree with them that we looked silly in our hats, but that didn’t stop us from wearing them all over town.It was tough to have to say goodbye to this alluring town and I wish we could have stayed longer. Unfortunately, our time in Vietnam was coming to an end, but not before visiting the windsurfing and kiteboarding mecca of Southeast Asia, Mui Ne. Plan Your Trip to Hoi An, VietnamAfter traveling consistently for over 10 years, we’ve come to trust and rely on a few websites to help us find the best deals on flights and accommodation.Flights: Momondo is the first place we check when searching for cheap flights.

https://ordinarytraveler.com/three-million-motorbikes-and-counting,"Northern Vietnam Travel Guide – Hanoi, Ha Long Bay & Cat Ba Island",Vietnam,"Our Northern Vietnam Travel Guide provides tips for where to stay and things to do in Hanoi, Ha Long Bay and Cat Ba Island! Northern Vietnam Travel Guide – Hanoi, Ha Long Bay & Cat Ba Island HanoiVietnam, for us, was a long awaited and highly anticipated visit to a country where so many people either love it or hate it. I, for one, can finally say… I love it! Maybe it was just good luck and we encountered friendly people, but we both found the natives of this country to be not only helpful, but also exuding a great sense of humor.Our first three days in Northern Vietnam were a whirlwind. From the moment we stepped foot into Hanoi, everything accelerated at a speed ten times faster than Laos, especially the traffic!We spent our first night in search of a decent hotel and an honest tour company to book a trip to Ha Long Bay. Mind you, this was all during one of the biggest holidays in Vietnam. April 30th is Liberation Day and May 1st is Labor Day. In other words, all the workers got three days off and many of them decided to spend it in Ha Long Bay.Our choice was to either skip the 1553 square km of the gorgeous Ha Long Bay altogether or buy an overpriced ticket on an extremely busy weekend. After our experience, I’m thinking it may have been better to avoid the chaos and go to Ninh Binh instead. However, at the time, we thought, “How bad can it be?”Finally, by about 11 in the evening, we had our tour booked for 7 am the next morning. The tour operator shifted us around so many times that we really had no idea what to expect for this 3 day, 2 night tour. While heading across the busy street to finally get some dinner, I was struck by a motorbike that neither of us saw coming. You have heard people say that at the moment right before an accident they have the sensation of time moving in slow motion, right?Well, that is exactly what happened to me as I saw the motorbike inching closer from the corner of my eye. However, even though time appeared to be moving in slow motion, I was not able to react any faster than usual. I actually felt like the only thing my body was able to do was freeze where I was standing and prepare for the impact.I am thankful he stopped just in time to only slam into my arm. Gratefully, I walked away with nothing but a few bruises and a justified fear of crossing the street in Vietnam cities. We got some food just before the restaurants closed and went back to our room at the lovely Tung Trang Hotel we found for $15/night. Tung Trang HotelJoin 200,000+ Monthly Readers!Sign up now to get insider tips & travel guides delivered right to your inbox!					The Tung Trang Hotel in the Old Quarter of Hanoi is owned by a gracious Vietnamese family. Our short stay here was extremely comfortable. The room was one of the nicest we had stayed at since Kata Beach.We enjoyed a private balcony that overlooked a quiet ally, free internet, and in the morning they cooked us breakfast in a cozy kitchen that reminded me of home. Our intention was to stay in Hanoi another night, but because of the holiday, our only chance to see the amazing limestone mountains of Ha Long Bay was leaving on a tour the very next day. Ha Long BayIt takes about 3 hours to get to Ha Long City from Hanoi by bus. I still haven’t gotten used to the way the Vietnamese seem to drive on both sides of the road. I’m beginning to wonder if they have any traffic laws. If they do, it seems nobody abides by them anyway.Our tour guide informed us there are more than 3 million motorbikes in Hanoi and probably double that amount in Saigon! Despite the crazy traffic, and driving on both sides of the road, we managed to get there in one piece. Upon arrival at the harbor is when we first realized how insanely crowded this trip was going to be. Tien, our tour guide, told us all to wait 30 minutes while he got our tickets.An hour and a half had passed before tour guide led us through the crowd and onto our boat. In order to get to our boat we had to climb through 2 other boats since they were packed about 4 boats deep into the harbor. Each time I jumped from one boat to the other, I prayed I would not fall in the water with all my camera gear.About 40 of us crammed into the dining area of the wooden boat and wondered when we would get to eat since it was already about 2 in the afternoon. Luckily we didn’t have to wait long for them to begin serving what I found out later to be the same meal we would eat for the next 3 days. Rice, steamed watercress, calamari, coleslaw, and fish — with the bone, eyes and teeth still attached — were all brought to our tables to eat communal style.For me, eating communal style with only chopsticks at hand was great. Eating only fish as my protein was not. Needless to say, I ate a lot of rice for the next 3 days and left the boat a few pounds lighter.After lunch, they unloaded everyone on shore to view a huge cave with many dripstones, some of which resembled animals or people. The cave was interesting, but it felt a bit artificial with the concrete walkways and the colorful lights that covered almost every inch of the huge cavern. It was nothing like the all-natural caves we experienced in Laos.After viewing the cave, we continued touring the beautiful bay and soaked in the sights while we relaxed on the upper deck of the boat. We had no idea where they were taking us next or when, which became the norm for the whole trip. We just had to go with the flow no matter what they threw at us. Visiting Cat Ba IslandOur next surprise was staying the night on Cat Ba Island. I imagined a relaxing, remote island where we could drink beers and chill on the beach. It seemed remote enough as our bus swerved around corners on a small road with infinite views of nature on both sides. A bit further up the road we began to see advertisement signs for soon-to-be-built luxury hotels along the water. Before I knew it, we were in bumper to bumper traffic in a city full of honking horns.Scott and I both thought this couldn’t possibly be where we are staying the night. I hoped this was only where they were dropping off the couple of passengers who were not on the same tour as us.They began calling out names. They couldn’t remember all of our names so they called us by our nationality. And then it came… “You! Americans! Come!” Ugh! We reluctantly gathered our bags and stepped onto the loud, busy sidewalk, amidst all the honking horns. Looks like we didn’t leave the Hanoi traffic behind!Our hotel that night was nothing like our beloved Tung Trang in Hanoi. I’m not a big fan of rooms with no windows, but at least it had TV and was somewhat clean. Since we had left the harbor late, we only had enough time to set down our bags before we had to be back downstairs for the dinner they would serve in the dining area. We ate with a couple of guys from Chile and shared a few laughs about how the food was probably just the leftovers from lunch. Cat Ba National ParkWe were exhausted from a day full of crowds, so we headed back to our room early because we also knew the tour’s strict schedule required us to be downstairs for breakfast at 7am. We got up early the next morning and arrived downstairs a little before 7.We had a new tour guide, unbeknownst to us, who informed us the bus was waiting to leave for the Cat Ba National Park hike and we needed to get on NOW! So much for breakfast at 7! We scarfed down our food and quickly got on the bus with our fellow tourists who seemingly knew to arrive downstairs earlier than 7.When I realized we were still waiting for someone else and also became aware of the fact that we were indeed about to go on a hike in flip flops, I ran upstairs to get sneakers for the both of us. That was our saving grace for what came next.The 3 hour hike in Cat Ba National Park was not what any of us expected. Especially those tourists who came wearing flip flops and high heels. Our group decided to take the “tougher” route up, therefore we were slipping through mud and scaling up the side of the mountain.The view at the top is spectacular, but don’t stay too long because the way down is the same way you came up and it’s only big enough for one person. You will have to wait for the mass of tourists trying to get to the top, which is only a small area and it was definitely at its max capacity by the time we were trying to get back down. It may have been easier if we spoke Vietnamese so that we could have communicated this to the impatient people trying to come up.Everyone in our group was sufficiently exhausted by the time we got back down the mountain and we all looked forward to relaxing for our remaining time on Cat Ba Island. But, not surprisingly, the moment we got back to the hotel we were told we needed to check out of our rooms and we had three hours of free time to enjoy the honking horns in the traffic-filled city of Cat Ba.This was probably the longest 3 hours of our entire trip considering we had no desire to come to this island in the first place and as far as we could see, there was nothing here that we cared to see.When the torture of spending hours in the loud city was over, we excitedly got on the bus to be taken back to the harbor for our night on a boat that would be cruising the waters of Ha Long. Our stay on the boat was well worth putting ourselves through the previous 30 hours.The only complaint we had was that our tour guides mixed up our passports with another couple on a different boat. (When you stay the night somewhere in Vietnam, they take your passports and only give them back to you at check out.) Upon checking out of our room is when they tried to give us passports from Belgium. Luckily we noticed they were not ours and the crew was able to track down our passports a few hours later. The moral of the story is…Don’t go to Ha Long Bay during a Vietnamese holiday. If given the choice again, we would have chosen to go somewhere less crowded, such as Sapa or Ninh Binh. Read More:10 Important Safety Tips for Solo Female TravelersThe Ultimate Vietnam Travel GuideBest Luggage Brands (And Tips For Choosing The Right One)Hoi An, Vietnam Travel GuideMy 25 Best Travel Tips After 10 Years of Traveling the WorldHow to Choose the Best Travel CameraMui Ne Travel Guide: The Kiteboarding Mecca of Southeast Asia "
