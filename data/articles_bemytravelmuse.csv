https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Austria-guide/,Austria guide,Austria,"Austria, your are so darn beautiful. I just can't get over it. Austria really is perfect to visit any time of year, and it's an outdoor-lover's dream. In the summer, it's perfect for hiking and mountain biking, and in the winter, of course it's perfect for skiing. With the gorgeous Alps running through the country and hundreds of beautiful valleys to explore, I've fallen more and more in love with it with each visit. The other special thing about the Austrian Alps is the feel. The hotels are usually just 30-60 rooms, the villages are quaint and cozy, the food is excellent, and as compared to North America, the skiing is actually much cheaper, but on hundreds of kilometers of slopes and in a really beautiful setting.  Austria, your are so darn beautiful.

It was one of the stops I traveled to following my grandma's journal, and I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the people go about their lives in more or less the same fashion as they did before - friendly and respectful. Crime rates are low, too.Climate: Summer is warm and crisp, autumn and spring are temperate and winters are cold, experiencing snow and freezing temperaturesBest SIM cards: Vodafone – cards can be purchased in person at any phone shop. Bring your passportRandom useful tip: If you really want to impress an Austrian, say, ""Oachkatzlschwoaf"", which means 'the squirrel's tail.' It doesn't have any deeper meaning but is just something that is unique to Austrian German and is difficult to sayAccommodationBudget Solo Traveler ($20 - $30): Similar to Iceland, hundreds of hostels in Austria are run by the HI Network, so if you are planning to stay exclusively in hostels in Austria, sign up for the membership to save $4 - $5 a night. Most hostels offer lockers to store your personal belongings, free Wi-Fi, and breakfast. Camping is available throughout the country, facilities are great, with many places offering laundry services, shops and snack bars.Mid Budget Solo Traveler ($50 - $100): Hotels are plentiful throughout the country. Expect to pay about $50 - $60 for a simple double room outside of the touristy areas, and $60 - $70 in the busier towns. In the winter, there are hundreds of ski resorts to choose from, so it’s not exaclt easy to make a choice! I personally recommend Skicircus, a laid back ski resort which offers 168 miles of slopes split among 3 different ski areas, and Lengauer Hof, a cozy place that offers good food and great hospitality. A double room at Skicircus starts at about $140, and at Lengauer the price starts at about $200, both of which can be split by 2 or 3 people.FoodLocal Food ($3 - $10): Austria dishes are hearty and inexpensive. A full meal with soup and (sometimes) dessert may cost only about $5 - $10. Keep an eye out for daily deals and lunch specials. Kebab and sausage stands are widely available at $3 - $5 per meal. At cafes and bars, expect to pay about $7 - $10 for a light meal. Coffee is pricey (about $3 - $6 for a cup) but excellent. Supermarkets are good place to get light snacks or sandwiches at $2 - $4. Make sure to check out the bakeries for some stunning pastries and desserts. Restaurant ($10 - $15): You seriously cannot go hungry while dining on Austrian food, especially when in a restaurant. A plate with grilled chicken, steak, pork, sausage, fries and salad costs about $15 - $20 at a farm-to-table restaurant. Wiener Schnitzel, a delicious breaded and pan fried cutlet made from veal, is Austria’s national dish, and it is available at most restaurants. Tipping is a practice in Austria at about 5% - 10%. Beer is inexpensive and delicious, with a glass costing about $2 - $6. TransportationGetting There: The main international airport is Vienna International Airport, though there is no shortage of other international airports around Vienna that are well connected to most major international flights. The country’s central location in Europe makes it easy to get there from its 7 surrounding countries through buses and trains. Getting Around: In Vienna, you can rent a bike from CityBike for free. This is perhaps the best and cheapest way to get around the city. It is also very safe to bike around the city as there are designated bike lanes for cyclists. Most major cities of Austria are well connected by buses, trams and underground trains. If you are staying longer than 3 days, obtain the pass to ride for cheap.Inter-city Traveling: Intercity trains are punctual and comprehensive, covering most parts of Austria. Unless you are doing a lot of intercity traveling in 3 days, individual tickets are actually cheaper than the one-country pass. Buses are a cheaper option, with a ride from Vienna to Munich costing about $24. There are six airports in Austria, and domestic flights start from about $25.Things to DoAdmire the Architecture of Vienna: The capital of Austria is filled with beautiful architecture, musuems, galleries and the likes. Spend a day wandering through the history centre, the catherals, and of course, the castles. When you can no longer feel your legs, sit down at one of the many coffee houses and spend the rest of your day people watching.Hike Krimml Waterfalls: The tallest waterfalls in Austria are located on the Krimmler Ache river in the High Tauern National Park, close to the town of Krimml. The path up to the panaroma view is well maintained so it would make a relaxing hike that takes about 1.5 hours.Ski (or Learn to Ski): When I asked a friend what makes skiing in Austria unique when compared to other Alpine ski areas, he said without hesitation, “It’s cozy.” And he was absolutely right. The hotels are mainly small and family-run, the food is wholesome, the locals are friendly, the snow condition is gorgeous, there’s fresh powder to ski on pretty much everyday. Skiing enthusiasts will find themselves home in Austria.Enjoy Other Winter Activities: You can take a gondola up to the top of a mountain and sled down (it’s so much fun!), take a break from skiing and go snow-shoeing , and even hang out at the tree tops at Austria’s very own Golden Gate Bridge. To end the day, you can chill at a rooftop pool, that opens from a heated room inside to the outsideHike the Longest Barefoot Trail in Austria: Hexenwasser (Witch Water) in Hochsöll is not only famous for its witches and fairy tales, but also offers spectacular scenary. The hike is relatively easy, and is perfect for a beautiful and relaxing day out. Recommended Products"
https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Aruba-guide/,Aruba guide,Aruba,"  Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Papiamento: ""Bon dia"" and ""danki"" although English is widely spoken. Currency: Aruban florin (click here for current conversion rates). USD is widely accepted as are credit cards.Visa: 30 day visa-on-arrival available for most nationalities (click here for more info)Solo Travel Friendliness: Out of all of the Caribbean islands, Aruba is perhaps the safest for solo travelers. The locals are friendly and open minded. It’s fine to walk alone but just practice the same precautions you would back home. However, hostels are rare, and the best way to get around Aruba is with a rental car, which can be costly if you are traveling solo.Climate: Pleasant year-round at an average of 80°F (27 °C). January - March is the busiest period. To avoid crowds, visit during April - August.Best SIM cards: Setar, which can be purchased at the airportRandom useful tip: Leave your flip flops behind when you go to the beach - Aruba’s white sand beaches are powdery, cool, and barefoot-friendly, even during noon time!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($20 - $30): Unfortunately, budget accommodation like dorms and local guesthouses are very rare in Aruba. In Oranjestad, you will find a handful of budget hostels at about $20 per night. Airbnb is perhaps a better option, with private rooms available at about the same price.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($50 and up): There are many apartments with great locations and facilities (this Airbnb listing is cute and cozy!). For some reasons, mid range hotels aren’t exactly widely available, but If you are looking for a luxury stay, there are a few high-end resorts and villas, as well as big hotel chains like the Renaissance of Marriott, which owns the infamous Flamingo island. FoodLocal Food Spots ($20 - $30): I loved the Eduardo’s beach shack that sells vegan smoothies, coconut frozen yogurt, small plates, and acai bowls, which are perfect for breakfast or even a light lunch. Local restaurants typically have a menu with Dutch, South American, and Caribbean influences. A meal at a local restaurant costs about $20 - $30. For something sweet, be sure to try the Dutch pancakes, which can be found on most streets.Restaurants & Seafood ($30 and up): The higher end resorts’ in-house restaurants typically serve up very decent food, and provide great ambience. It is also highly recommended that you head to Zeerovers for some freshly caught seafood of the day. Expect to pay about $30 - $50 for a meal at a mid range restaurant. TransportationGetting There: The main international airport is Reina Beatrix International Airport. Hundreds of direct flights from major North American countries arrive at Aruba on a weekly basis. It is also possible to arrive at the cruise terminal via cruise liner.Getting Around: Aruba has a great bus system that’s cheap and widely available. Each ride costs $2, and the bus goes around the entire island. Taxis are also everywhere. If you want to get to more remote places, consider renting a car, which costs about $45 - $50 per day. That being said, most beaches, shopping streets and restaurants are typically within walking distance from your apartment or hotels, so if you are only traveling in Aruba for a couple of days, you may be able to get everywhere on foot!Things to DoVisit Flamingo Island: It is what makes Aruba so famous, after all! There's really nothing like chilling with a bunch of pink compadres in that beautiful blue Caribbean water. To do this, you need to get to the Renaissance island, which is privately owned. You can stay at the Renaissance Hotel since it’s included as a hotel perk, or you can pay a $120 fee for access to the island for the day. It includes the boat transfer, lunch on the island, and a drink. Read this post for a full guide on visiting the Flamingo Island.Explore the Beaches: The Aruban beaches are made of soft white sand and baby blue water. You can swim and snorkel, take long walks, or simply relax all day. The water is calm, and the temperature is usually great. Just make sure to wear sunblock as Aruba is quite close to the equator.Visit Arikok National Park: Arikok was one of the highlights of my first trip to Aruba. This is where you can find the famous caves, the natural pool, and a much more rugged stretch of coast. Get to the nature pool as early as you can, and you might have it all to yourself. Note that you will need a 4x4 for this.Snorkeling or Scuba Diving: The water is clear and there are plenty of fish in Aruba. There is also a shallow wreck, which is a rare find in the diving world. While the variety of things you can see may not be as impressive as some other parts of the world, for those who love diving this is still a great spot to get under the water.Pick up kitesurfing: Aruba receives the most consistent wind among the Caribbean islands, making it the perfect spot for kitesurfing. If you are new to the sport, you will find many kitesurfing school offering 4-day or 6-day lessons. For experienced surfers, Boca Grandi Beach is an excellent spot.Hiking: A great way to explore Aruba's nature is to hike, and if you've never seen a Cacti tree before, now's your chance! In Arikok National Park, you will find 3 hiking trails designed for 3 different fitness levels. The afternoon sun can be unforgiving so hike in the morning if you can. Sunblock and water are essential.Go on a Jeep adventure: While the public transportation is great in Aruba, it is only with your own vehicle that you will be able to explore places that are more remote and have a little adventure. I rented a 4x4 and was able to get to the Wariruri rock bridge, Trinity bridge, and of course the Arikok National Park. If you are not comfortable driving, there are Jeep tours available, too.Sunset at the California Lighthouse: Head to the California Lighthouse on the northern tip of the island for sunset. You get a fantastic view, and the lighthouse is a great photo spot as well.Visit the Bridges: Watching the waves come and go on the beautiful bridges is an experience you need to try out when in Aruba. The biggest bridge, the Natural Bridge, has collapsed in 2005. Currently, the Wariruri Rock Bridge is the biggest. My personal favorite is the Trinity Bridge, which I thought was perfect for sunrise.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Botswana-guide/,Botswana guide,Botswana,"Botswana is my favorite country for wildlife viewing out of the ten African countries I’ve traveled in so far. The sheer number of elephants, hippos, giraffes, birds, crocodiles, and even the small things like beautifully-colored snakes and spiders, abound in Botswana. The methods for viewing them can also be an adventure, from taking a lightweight plane over the Okavango Delta, to taking a makoro (canoe-like boat) through the reeds on the ground, and boating over the Chobe River in Chobe National Park at sunset, Botswana truly is a unique adventure. I felt like I had stepped out of reality and right into the Lion King. It’s also regularly ranked one of the safest countries in Africa, and has decent roads and a great safari lodge system as well.

Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Tswana:  In most of Botswana, English will work just fine, but it's nice to know a bit of the most spoken language in the country as well - “Dumela”, and “Ke a Leboga”Currency: Botswana Pula (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: 30-days visa on arrival for most nationalities. A $30 Tourism Development Levy is required Safety rating: Ranked 30 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.68 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40). This means that Botswana is one of the safest countries in AfricaSolo Travel Friendliness: Ranked the safest country in Africa, Botswana is nice to travel through alone. The lack of language barrier means it is easy to communicate and strike up a conversation with the locals as well. Most lodges are small and intimate, so you are likely to find yourself hanging out with everyone else in the common area, or at a dinner table sharing a big meal together.Climate: Hot and dry throughout the year, rainy season starts from December – March, though it is pretty common for the country to experience no rain for 6 months straightBest SIM cards: Mascom – cards can be purchased at the airport and authorized shops Modesty Considerations: Botswana is generally relaxed about clothing and covering up. Though a sarong or scarf can always come in handy. Another thing to note is that wearing camouflage or military clothing is illegalRandom useful tip: Botswana is one of the more expensive countries in Africa, and the cost for a basic dorm may not differ much from a more established hotel. If you have the budget, I recommend topping up a little on your accommodation cost and spoil yourself for a night with glamping instead of campingAccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($10 - $30): Basic campsites and traditional wooden huts are your best options if you are trying to keep your budget low in Botswana. Expect to pay about $10 - $20 for a night. In the major areas, hostels and guesthouses are available for about $20 - $30 per night. Most of the budget accommodations are well-maintained and a good value for the money. Expect hot showers, working electricity, and for the wooden huts, en-suite bathrooms. Cheap accommodation options with great reviews tend to get booked out quickly, especially during the peak season, so book ahead if possible.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($30 and up): Glamping is super fun and an awesome change if you have been spending the past few nights at a basic campsite. Glamping in Botswana typically consists of a fixed ‘safari’ tent with en-suite bathroom, as well as ground staff who cook the meals and do the cleaning. Guesthouses, hotels and lodges have sprung up in recent years, most of which are comfortable but nothing really outstanding. Airbnbs average at about $60 for a private room (though plenty of rooms are available at about $20), and about $80 for an entire unit.FoodLocal Eats ($3 - $5): The traditional Botswana dishes use corn and sorghum as the main ingredients. The daily staples consist of a stewed beef with vegetables. Believe it or not beef is actually cheaper than chicken in Botswana, since they have so much cattle. There are local restaurants and street stalls in most urban and transit areas for about $3 - $5. Local markets are a great place to sample some local snacks. Make sure to try the melons as they are very popular in Botswana.Restaurants and Bars ($5 - $15): There are many good quality restaurants and bars in the major cities, most of which are located in hotels. Expect to see both local and western cuisine on the menu. Most restaurants offer good quality meat dishes at an affordable price, whereas seafood is rare and expensive. Beer is excellent and a bottle costs about $1 - $3. If you do a safari tour, the lodges typically cover your meals and they are usually delicious. The chefs incorporate local ingredients into international cuisines, and vice versa. Game meat is expected on most restaurant menus in the safari areas. I highly recommend sampling it! TransportationGetting There: Botswana’s main airport is Sir Seretse Khama International Aiport. The only scheduled flights are available from its surrounding countries, and travelers from other continents generally have to make a stopover in Johannesburg or Cape Town before flying into Botswana. The country is landlocked and surrounded by South Africa, Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Access to Botswana from these countries overland is well-developed and relatively fuss-free. Borders are open daily, and you can enter Botswana from Zambia via ferry, and from the other three countries through buses or rental cars.Getting Around: Hiring or renting a car is the most practical way to get around Botswana. The local public transportation is currently limited to major cities and routes, this means that it could be very challenging to get to the rural villages or interesting areas with local buses or combis (minivans with blue number plates). Taxis are commonly used for getting to the airport, and they are usually unmetered so make sure to agree on a price before getting onto one.Things To Do(click to read my full blog post on things to do in Botswana!)See the Okavango Delta: The Okavango Delta is known as Africa’s last Eden. The UNESCO World Heritage site discharges a whooping 11,000,000,000,000 litres of water each year. The Okavango Delta hosts large concentration of animals such as elephants, crocodiles, hippos, buffalo, and so many more, and it is one of the best places to see animals in Africa thanks to careful wildlife management by the local authorities. Given its sheer size, a lightweight plane ride is the best way to see the delta.Go Glamping: For most of my Africa camping experiences, I went with the cheapest option I could find, which required me to pitch my own tent and cook my own food. When I went to Botswana, I decided glamped for a night on the Okavango Delta and enjoyed it immensely. After spending two weeks in a tent with a mat and sleeping bag, some nights of which were wet thanks to rainy season, sleeping in a fixed tent with its own en-suite bathrooms was quite a treat. I highly recommend giving it a try!Hang Out With The Elephants in Chobe National Park: The very first national park of Botswana is famed for its large herds of massive African elephants that are entirely grey, hairless, and have massive ears and majestic tusks. They also seem to have all of the animals from The Lion King at the national park. Cruise along the Zambezi River and wait for the sunset.Hang Out With The Rhinos At The Khama Rhino Sanctuary: The sanctuary sets out to assist in saving the critically endangered rhinoceros. While attempting to restore the area to its previous natural state, it also helps provide economic benefits to the locals through sustainable tourism. This is a great place to spot black and white rhinos, as well as over 30 other animal species that hang around that area. Recommended Products"

Campgrounds tend to get busy from July – August and it is advisable to book in advance or show up as early as possible. Expect to pay about $10 for a night, though in most wilderness areas you can camp anywhere you please for free. Dorms cost about $15 - $20 in most parts of the country, and about $5 more in major cities like Vancouver and Toronto. If you are planning on staying exclusively in hostels, consider signing up for a HI Network membership to receive discounts and better deals.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($35 and up): A hostel private room costs about $35 - $40. The most budget-friendly hotels will set you back about $70 for a private double, with basic amenities and minimum facilities. Some budget hotels offer weekly rates that could be much cheaper. Airbnbs cost about $30 for a decent private room, and about $80 for an entire unit.Other Accommodation Options: If you are interested in a unique accommodation experience, many farms in the west double as B&Bs. Expect to pay about $100 with meals and some activities included. Not only do you get to mingle with the hosts and get to know the farming life better, you can also work on the farm if you want. TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Toronto Pearson International Airport, Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, and Vancouver International Airport. Direct flights are available from the US, the UK, most parts of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Most US travelers drive into Canada, whereas buses, ferries and trains are also available for border crossings.Getting Around: Most  major cities have decent public transportation networks, and buses and trains are reliable and affordable. Bike rentals are widely available, and many major city roads are bike-friendly with designated path for cyclists. Uber is available as well in most major cities. Outside of the major metro areas, public transportation is scarce. The most convenient way to get around is to rent a car.  Inter-city Traveling: Greyhound Canada is the main long-distance bus company that offers frequent departures and extensive route coverage throughout the country. Booking tickets in advance will help secure a seat, especially during the peak season. Sometimes the website offers discounts for booking in advance as well. To travel between Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, VIA Rail offers train rides with gorgeous scenery along the way. Renting a car or even better, a campervan, is another great way to get around the country.FoodGrocery Shop & Cook Your Own Food ($5 - $10): To save money, you can buy your own groceries at local supermarkets and cook your own meals. Most dorms and campgrounds have kitchen facilities. Expect a week’s worth of groceries to cost about $50 - $60.Restaurants, Cafes & Bars ($10 - $30): For breakfast, check out the local cafes and coffee shops – while they cost about $10 - $15 for a full meal with drinks, they are huge in portion with great variety, and are often a good value for the money. Many restaurants offer lunch specials at about $10 - $15, though if you are still full from the big breakfast, there are also plenty of sandwich shops for a quick bite. Since Canada is so ethnically diverse, international restaurants serve all kinds of food including Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Italian cuisine. Food is also served at most Canadian bars. Local beer costs about $3 - $5 - look out for microbreweries.Things to DoHang Out With Whales And Polar Bears: Head to Churchill, Manitoba, known as the “Polar Bear Capital of the World”, hook yourself up with a reputable company (I went with Lazy Bear Expeditions), and be ready to see the cute yet deadly polar bears, and the equally adorable Beluga whales. For whale watching, there are different ways to do it – you can take a boat out and watch them as they get closer, or kayak your way out as they swim toward you (a curious and friendly bunch, these guys!), or even snorkel with them.Visit Nopiming Provincial Park: Camping at Nopiming Provincial Park almost felt like camping at a secret spot - there are no humming motors of RVs, no selfie sticks, and no shower queues. You could take a canoe out and paddle your day away, or swim in the refreshing water. The sunrise is beautiful, the starry night sky even better, and if you are in luck, you might even see the northern lights. This is a place that will remind you how simple and easy joy can be obtained. Ski In Banff: Banff offers excellent trails that are perfect for skiing. The main ski areas are Sunshine Village, Lake Louise Ski Resort, and Mount Norquay. If skiing is not for you, you can also go snowshoeing, tubing, ice-climbing, and even caving! There’s a ton to do in and around that area, and while it could get a bit crowded during the summer, it is definitely worth visiting in the slower winter months! Take A Road Trip: I know this is my 3rd time mentioning this, but Canada is seriously such an amazing country to do a road trip in. With a car or a campervan, you can see the countryside, the beautiful hills, and many other places off the tourist radar. Whether solo or with a buddy, road tripping and camping is a great way to explore Canada.Niagara Falls: The falls can be seen from all kinds of angles and vantage points – there are boats, helicopters, cable cars, viewing towers, and even a tunnel tucked behind the cascade. It is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world, and the area is very touristy, but it should not stop you from visiting the massive falls that send water rushing down from 167’ high.See The Murals In Churchill: Organized by the Pangea Seed Foundation’s Sea Walls project and Winnipeg artist, Kal Barteski, several muralists from around the world joined forces in the small town and created 18 large-scale murals that promote ocean conservation not only in Churchill, but worldwide. The beautiful murals in Churchill give travelers another reason beyond the belugas and polar bears to explore Churchill.

Couchsurfing and Airbnbs may be great alternatives for those who are on a tight budget. There are also campsites close to train stations with decent facilities.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($60 - $100): Privacy comes with a high price in most places in Switzerland. More and more hotels offer basic single rooms, though by Switzerland’s standards, a  “basic” room typically comes with a flat-screen TV, toiletries, and gorgeous mountain views.  They are quite worth the splurge, if you asked me!Other Accommodation Options: I personally stayed at the two hotels below when I visited Switzerland, and I highly recommend both of them! Morosani was luxurious for the most part but the rooms themselves were warm, charming, and nice and quiet, whereas Silvana was a family-run joint that was cute and peaceful.Morosani Posthotel, DavosSilvana Mountain Hotel, ZermattTransportationGetting There: The main airports are Geneva Airport, Zurich Airport, and Basel-Mulhouse Airport. They are generally well connected with major international flights coming in constantly, although you are more likely to be taking the train if you are coming from other parts of Europe, such as Paris, Munich, Milan, and Salzburg. Another option is by bus, which is available from Paris, Rome, Munich, and Florence. Finally, you can also take the ferry from France, Italy, and Germany to get to Switzerland.Getting Around town: Buses and trains within major cities in Switzerland are punctual and efficient. Expect to pay $2 - $5 for a single trip. Another option is carpooling – BlablaCar is a popular ridesharing site in Switzerland, however trip cancellation is very common so it’s wise to use it when you have flexibility. Uber is currently available in Basel, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich.Inter-city Traveling: If you plan to stay for a while and travel frequently, make sure to get the Swiss Travel Pass that allows unlimited traveling throughout the country by train. With the pass, you can just board and enjoy the ride, and even get discounts and free entrances to some attractions and many museums, all at an average cost of about $35/day (15 day pass). Booking last-minute is hideously expensive so try to avoid it!FoodGrocery Shop & Cook Your Own Food ($5 - $15): Food is expensive in Switzerland – even McDonald’s costs about $15 a meal! The best way to save up on food is to do your grocery shopping at the local supermarkets and cook your own food at the hostel or Airbnb. You can also purchase pre-made meals and heat them up at the supermarket if your hostel doesn’t have a kitchen.Cafes & Bars ($15 - $30): I personally did not try this but it is recommended to get the Swiss Coupon Pass which comes with 100 coupons offering discounts on not only dining but also attraction entrances and tours. Keep a close eye on lunch promos and happy hours.  Restaurants ($30 and up): If you are in the mood to splurge on eating out, Switzerland is the right place to be. From a long list of Michelin-starred restaurants, to a dining experience on a mountaintop, you will find yourself spoiled for choice. Price-wise, the sky's the limit. My personal preference is to dine at the hotel restaurants, and both Morosani and Silvana did not disappoint. I still think about Pöstli, and their delicious beef carpaccio, sometimes.Things to DoSkiing: Switzerland has some of the most dramatic snowy mountains I’ve ever seen. In Davos, prepay for your lift tickets online to get a discount, and enjoy skiing (with real snow!) at Parsenn, Pischa, Madrisa, Rinerhorn, and Jakobshorn. Matterhorn, the world famous mountain peak, offers skiing opportunities all year round. As for the experts, Verbier is highly recommended for its challenging high-altitude terrain.Hiking & Trailing: These are perfect activities if you are in Switzerland in the summer! I personally recommend Edelweissweg and Stellisee in Zermatt, while others rave about Mt. Pilatus which offers a gorgeous Swiss Alps view at the top. As for a leisure hike, check out Mt. Rigi. There are a great many more, but these can get you started!Chase Waterfalls: Surround yourself with the thunderous roar of the biggest waterfall in Europe, The Rhine Falls. You can take a boat tour to the middle of the waterfall, or view the falls from both sides of the river. There is also a castle nearby that doubles up as a youth hostel. Another beautiful waterfalls that blew me away is at Oeschinen Lake. The waterfalls are located along the rocky beach trail, marked with rock cairns, that you can walk under, around, and in.Swim in Lavertezzo: Ready to jump into the clearest water that you have ever seen? Take a train to Tenero, and board bus 321. Pack some food and beverage, as well as sunscreen, go for a swim, lie on the rocks, and soak it all in.Explore Zurich: Spend a few nights here after all that skiing and hiking as there is plenty to do in this beautiful city that’s rich with café culture and nightlife. Be sure to try out the infamous Swiss fondue which I think is perfect for a cold night, and take a nice, long stroll along the Zurich River, or even better, grab one of the free bikes and cycle around. Old town is perfect for aimless wandering, and if you are feeling fancy, wander to Bahnhofstrasse, one of the most expensive shopping streets in the world.Visit Geneva: Lake Geneva is not the only thing that the city can offer. There are 40 museums, a 140-meter high fountain (Jet d’Eau), art galleries, cathedrals, monuments, and more. While it could be tough to keep your budget in check in Geneva, one of the most expensive cities in the world, you can get the Geneva Pass, which comes with free transportation and free entrance to many of the 40 museums in Geneva. Get to the Top of Europe: The highest-altitude railway station in Europe is in Switzerland. To get there, simply ride your way to Jungfraujoch by taking the Jungfrau Railway.Apps to downloadCitymapper (for navigation), TheFork (for restaurant recommendations and discounts), Fly Europe Recommended Products"
https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Chile-guide/,Chile guide,Chile,"After spending two months in Chile, I left thinking it really does 'have it all' in terms of landscape. Chile is one of the longest countries in the world, narrowly beaten out by Brazil, is home to the driest desert on earth, the most remote island on earth, and partial home (shared with Argentina) to the third largest frozen body of fresh water in the world. For those who adore hiking, rock climbing, sailing, red wine, and an all-in-one vacation destination, Chile is it. Chile is also the most prosperous nation in South America, and leads Latin America in peace, income per capita, and democratic development, making it a great place to explore for first-timers to South America.

Australians must pay a reciprocity fee (click here for more info).Safety rating: Ranked 27 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.63 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40).Solo Travel Friendliness: The locals are friendly, there’s an excellent transportation network, and a low rate of violent crime. Chile is a great country for solo travelers to start their South American journey. That said, in major cities like Santiago, pickpocketing does happen so always keep an eye on your belongings. Additionally, catcalling is normal in Chile just like the rest of South America. Climate: Since Chile is so long, it depends on where you go. In the far north, expect scorching hot summers and in Patagonia, be prepared for heavy winds, rain, and cold all year-round. Winters often experience snow in the mountains and in Patagonia.Best SIM cards: Claro or Virgin. Easily purchasable from street vendors who also sell air time. Spanish speaking ability (or a friend who can help) required.Random useful tip: If hiking in Patagonia, bring waterproof hiking shoes, a waterproof and windproof jacket, and clothing that can handle all temperatures, seriously!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($5 - $20): Camping is awesome in Chile! In Patagonia, it will be available just about everywhere you go. If you have a tent with you, expect to pay $5 - $20 to camp at campsites with kitchen facilities and showers. In the San Pedro de Atacama Desert, free camping is available at the park entrance at the Valle de la Luna, and there are plenty of places where you can simply follow car tracks off the road and find a nice, totally secluded spot for the night. Camping is also an option in popular places like the Easter Island. Dorms on the mainland generally cost about $10 - $15 per night, offering free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Consider a HI Network membership to get better rates if you plan on staying exclusively in hostels.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($20 and up): Expect to pay about $35 - $40 for a private room in a hostel or a budget hotel. Airbnbs average at about $20 for a private room, and at about $55 for an entire unit. Cabanas are very popular in Chile, and you’ll find them in popular areas, especially by the coast. Staying and sharing a locally-run cabana will save a bunch of money – a cabana can often accommodate six or seven people for around $50+ per night. They come with a kitchen so that you can cook your own food as well to save money - this is a particularly good option on Easter Island.TransportationGetting There: The main international airport is Comodoro Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport, located in Santiago. Direct flights are available from the US, Canada, New Zealand, Europe, and Australia. Crossing borders overland is possible by bus from Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. Go for the full-cama beds so that you can recline fully if on an overnight bus. Note that many passes close in winter due to snow. I once missed a flight in April due to this!Getting Around: Public transportation is reliable, cheap, and comfortable in Chile. Local buses (called micros) cover a wide range of routes, and a short single trip typically costs less than $1. Destinations are usually displayed on the window, and a ticket is issued by the bus captain at the point of boarding. Shared taxis (called colectivos) usually cost only slightly more than the local buses, and are much more comfortable. Similar to the local buses, destinations are displayed on the windows. Taxis are metered and widely available in major cities. In Santiago, trains are incredibly efficient, though they get very crowded during peak hours.Inter-city Traveling: Long distance buses are reliable and comfortable. Most inter-city buses have reclining seats, plenty of legroom, and frequent departures. Prices vary between companies, and the most popular bus companies are Tur Bus and Pullman. Buy tickets online, at your hostel, or in person at the bus stations. To reach the wilderness areas that are not accessible by local transportation, it makes sense to rent a car, though my personal recommendation is to rent a campervan and have it double as your accommodation as well. Make sure to double check everything when you pick up the vehicle. Hitchhiking is widely common and sometimes the only option in Patagonia, where the locals are used to hitchhiking and picking up hitchhikers.FoodLocal Eats ($5 - $10): Local staples include potatoes, avocados, and sweetcorn. Beef is excellent throughout the country. Eating out can be expensive in Chile but it’s worth it now and then. Budget travelers can buy groceries at the local supermarkets and cook their own food at the hostels or campsites, which typically have kitchens and cooking utensils available for guest use. Expect to pay about $30 - $50 for a week’s worth of groceries. Small meals like empanadas, sandwiches, pita bread, and sausages are sold by street vendors. Lunch deals, or menu del dia, offer a complete meal with starter, main, and dessert for about $7 - $10.Restaurants & Bars ($20 - $30): Great quality restaurants and cafes are ubiquitous in major cities. Beef is the country’s pride and it’s definitely worth splurging now and then on a meal out. Expect to pay about $20 for a steak with a glass of wine. I have also had some of the best lamb ever in Patagonia, cooked on a spit and called cordero patagonico, so keep a lookout for that! If you are in the coastal areas, make sure to order Chile’s fish and seafood, which rank among the best in the world. Bars in major cities and coastal areas serve great fruit juices, beer, and wine. Things to doGet Artistic in Valparaíso: Valparaíso is a colorful menagerie of narrow alleyways, spray painted self expression, and colorful houses up steep streets. The entire district is a UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s characterized by tall and narrow streets with tall and narrow houses and funiculars, and in some ways reminds me of San Francisco, which would make sense given its nickname is ‘little San Francisco’. One can easily spend a couple of hours (or even a day or two!) wandering and getting inspired by the street art and its people in this gem of a spot.Explore Easter Island: Standing right in front of the giant Moai statues, towering above us mere mortals, is an incredibly humbling experience. It’s like taking a walk into the past, and contrary to popular belief, it can be done affordably and without the crowds. It is not necessary to go with a tour company, as the island is small, and transportation is available in the form of car rentals, quads, and motorbikes. Other than the humbling, giant statues, other activities on the Easter Island include exploring the Ranu Kau Volcano, going SCUBA diving, surfing, and chilling on the only beach on the island.Camp in the San Pedro de Atacama Desert: The San Pedro de Atacama desert in Northern Chile is famous for a few good reasons: It’s the driest desert in the world, has some of the best viewing for stars in the night sky, and it’s full of otherworldly-looking canyons, lakes, and landmarks. It’s also got plenty of awesome camping spots. Rent a cool campervan, make sure it has a kitchen, bring blankets (it gets very cold at night), plenty of water, and find your own sweet spots. My personal favorite was at the Laguna Chaxa, where I saw the clearest milky way ever.Hike Torres del Paine: Each year this national park gets exponentially more popular as trekkers discover that Torres del Paine in Chile is a stunning adventure, full of changing landscapes and a glimpse of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, especially from the full O circuit. The trek typically takes about 8 days, with several starting point to choose from. A good tent, shoes, and hiking poles are necessary for this trek. Here is a full guide to trekking the Torres del Paine.Snowshoe in el Cani: The park was founded by locals who wanted to protect this area from the woodworking industry. One of the oldest trees in the world, Araucaria tree, can be seen here. The trail to the private national park is pretty steep, but it’s a great spot to snowshoe in, walking along a former volcano crater, lagoons, and the beautiful trees is a wonderful experience.Get to know Siantiago: Chances are you'll be flying into or out of the capital of Chile at some point during your exploration. This vibrant city has street art, great nightlife, and a culture all its own. Read more about things to do there here. Recommended Products"

It's culturally about as different as you can get to a typical Westerner's background. China isn't light touring, it's real traveling.

Amount of days heavily depends on where you obtain it. Best method is at home from your home country.Safety rating: Ranked 110 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 2.22 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40) - this is mainly due to political terror and heavy weapon numbers. Tourists, however, are rarely victims of violent crime.Solo Travel Friendliness: I had a first-hand experience with Chinese hospitality when hitchhiking in China back in 2014. People were friendly and generous, and I never once felt threatened or endangered. Because traveling solo as a female is not a norm in most parts of the country, you might get questions from the locals and in some situations, it will make things easier to say that you are meeting a friend soon.Climate: Depends on region. Winter is generally cold and snowy and summer is hot and humidBest SIM cards: China Mobile – all telcos are state owned and controlled. Cards can be purchased at the airport and assigned shops throughout the entire country. Bring your passportModesty Considerations: Major cities are incredibly modern and trendy and there’s no specific dress codes, though you may be required to cover your shoulder and knees when visiting the temples. In the rural areas, people are more conservative and it is polite to dress modestly.Random useful tip: Learn some Chinese. China is one of the countries where English will not be spoken much, if at all, and a few words go a very long way!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($5 - $10): Hostels in China might offer the best value in the world - they’re usually pretty nice! Dorms and youth hostels are common in most cities and in small villages, with new places often drastically better than the old ones in terms of quality and service. Expect to pay about $5 for a basic dorm room with fan, and more in bigger cities for the same room type. If you choose to walk in instead of booking ahead, make sure to ask to see the room first, and negotiate –. Expect to pay 30% less than the advertised price during low season. Couchsurfing is also increasingly popular in major cities.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($10 - $30): The same theory applies to budget and mid-range hotels – new places are generally much better than the older ones. There are single, double, triple and even quadruple rooms to choose from. Most private rooms come with free breakfast. Take note that the use of different Chinese words for the hotel is an indication of quality and price range, with Da Jiu Dian is on the higher end of the spectrum, and Zhu Su is on the cheaper end. Airbnbs average at about $25 for a private room, and at about $55 for an entire unit.TransportationGetting There: Most major cities have their respective international airports, while the most major ones include Beijing Capital International Airport, Guangzhou Baiyan International Airport, and Shanghai Pudong International Airport. Direct flights are available from most parts of the world. Crossing borders overland is possible from Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Nepal, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and the Central Asian Republics. If you’d like, you can also take a ferry from Korea and Japan to China. Getting Around Town: The Chinese government invests heavily in transportation and infrastructure, making getting around a breeze – as long as you can recognize the destinations in Chinese writing. Trains are efficient and punctual, with a single trip costing as low as $0.20; buses, on the other hand, while frequent and cover routes wider than trains, often do not always have fixed schedules, so allow time to get the bus station and buy your ticket rather than waiting until the last minute.. DiDi is China’s version of Uber and it is available in all cities.Inter-city Travel: Inter-city trains are efficient and fast – high speed trains reach 210 miles per hour. The cabins are spotlessly clean and comfortable but much more expensive than normal trains. Expect to dish out more than $100 for a ticket from Shanghai to Beijing. Trains of other classes are less comfortable but much cheaper, and all trains offer food for purchase onboard. Buses depart frequently and cover routes wider than trains. Flying from one city to another is easy, and sometimes cost less than trains. Hitchhiking in China, based on my personal experience, is surprisingly easy and you are bound to meet friendly and generous locals who are more than willing to help and expect nothing in return. It does help, however, if you have a Mandarin speaker with you. FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 - $5): The food in China is cheap and delicious.  A big bowl of noodle soup usually costs less than $1! Food stalls on the roadside, markets, and hole-in-the-wall style restaurants with plastic tables and chairs are where you can sample true Chinese cuisine at a low price. However, hygiene and food safety are often questionable , so pick places that are crowded with locals and when possible, take a quick glance at the kitchen. Restaurants ($5 and up): Most Chinese restaurants tend to be set up for groups, with large round tables and mostly a la carte items on the menu. A restaurant dining experience is best shared with friends made at the hostel, as you get to sample different dishes and share the bill. Most dishes are freshly prepared, especially seafood – some restaurants have aquariums keeping the fishes, crabs, lobsters, and prawns fresh and, well, alive until the last minute. Prices vary depending on your order. A simple vegetarian stir fry could cost less than $3, whereas exotic seafood could cost hundreds. Tipping is not expected in most restaurants. Western restaurants are on the rise though the food is usually disappointing, so it’s best to stick to trying out Chinese cuisine.Things to DoJiuzhaigou and Beyond: Neighboring Tibet, Jiuzhaigou is instantly recognizable by its colorful lakes with crystal clear water reflecting their surrounding mountains, and vast array of multicolored prayer flags that have been strewn across the hillsides. It is often packed with tourists, locals and foreigners alike. If you want to look for something off the beaten path, there is Huanglong National Park, a hidden gem of the province that is only a 40-minute drive away from Jiuzhaigou.Trek in Sichuan: This province is full of amazing treks. One of the must-sees is Siguniang Shan (Four Sisters Mountain) East of Chengdu in Sichuan province’s Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. It’s  a trek that most foreigners aren’t aware of and haven’t had the opportunity to see. Another trek worth checking out is Mount Emei, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Due to its significance and popularity, the Emei shan hike has been paved with stairs and offers gondolas up and down as well.Explore Modern Shanghai: This is what the future looks like! This cosmopolitan city is packed with the latest technology, neon lights, and billboards. The top of China’s tallest building, Shanghai Tower (119 floors!), is the perfect spot to get a panorama view of the city. The Great Wall of China: The 2,300 year old wall that was built to fend off invasions is now the most iconic place in China. Expect the place to be packed with tourists no matter the time of the year. Tiananmen Square: Located right in the center of Beijing, Tiananmen Square is one of the biggest city squares in the world. If you are interested, you can see Mao Zedong’s embalmed body in the mausoleum between 8am – 12pm. There are also museums, viewing halls, and Communist architecture that could easily take an entire day to go through.Apps to DownloadWeChat (essentially China’s version of Facebook, you can even order food, make reservations, and send money through the app), DiDi (China’s version of Uber), ExpressVPN (to access websites that are blocked in China).

SIMs can be purchased in person at any phone shop. Bring your passport. More info about German SIM cards here. Random useful tip: Autumn is a wonderful time to be in Germany - it's much less crowded, the weather is not freezing cold yet, and the changing leaves are beautiful. Don't expect much of anything to be open on Sundays apart from some restaurants and bars. This is primetime for flea market shopping, though! AccommodationBest hostels for low budget solo female travelers ($10 - $35): There are many hostels at different price points throughout the country, making finding a place to rest your head for the night a relatively simple task. Though during peak seasons, it is wise to book ahead as places with good ratings may get booked out quickly. The trendy independent hostels are affordable and often packed with character. Dorms are cheap and usually come with free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Couchsurfing is also popular in major cities. Best hotels for mid budget solo female travelers ($40 - $70): The same independent hostels mentioned above usually also offer private double rooms for about $25, though for full privacy, one may check into one of the many budget hotels in Germany for about $40 - $60 a night. Private rooms usually come with your own bathroom. Airbnbs in Germany offer beautifully decorated accommodation at  reasonable price range, with a private room averaging at $40 a night, and an entire unit averaging at $70 a night. Other Accommodation Options: Private houses or farms in remote areas offer accommodations to those who looking for a unique accommodation experience. Especially with farmstays, you will enjoy home cooked meals and a farm life experience. They are also often cheaper than hotel rooms. Camping is possible at designated campsites (wild camping is illegal in Germany).TransportationGetting There: The main international airport is Frankfurt Airport, followed by Munich International Airport and Düsseldorf International Airport. Budget airlines are plentiful, which means entering Germany by air can be very cheap. In terms of crossing borders overland, trains connecting Germany with all of its neighboring countries are the best option other than a car rental.Getting Around: Trains are the main public transportation in Germany. A single trip typically costs around $2 - $4, and you can get different rail passes depending on the length of stay to ride for cheap. Buses and trams are available as well. Cycling is another great way to get around town. Most roads have dedicated cycle paths, and vehicles know to look out for cyclists. Uber in Germany just calls a normal taxi, with an extra €1.50 fee. I recommend only taking taxis if you are traveling in a group or in a hurry, as they are pretty expensive. Inter-city Traveling: Intercity-Express Trains are extremely efficient, traveling up to185 miles / hour, but a ride from Berlin to Munich can cost you close to $200 if you book on the spot. Booking in advance may get you a discounted rate. Other standard intercity express trains are slower but cheaper. Make sure to check the deals on rail passes, such as Eurail, and group tickets available during your visit. There is a car-sharing system called Bla Bla Car that has a similar concept to hitchhiking. Available journeys are published online and they could be much cheaper than taking the trains. If you prefer taking the bus, Flixbus is an affordable option, though it may take much longer than the trains. Budget airlines sometimes offer tickets as cheap as $35 to get from one city to another.FoodStreet Food ($3 - $5): Food is cheap and hearty in Germany. Particularly in Berlin, where I base myself. Expect to find food trucks, street food kiosks and little restaurants everywhere! You can easily fill your tummy up with sausages, burgers and bratwurst for as low as $3 - $5. Make sure to check out Street Food Thursday, where around 20-30 street food vendors gather from 5-10 p.m. In addition, reflecting the immigration patterns, you can find Turkish and Greek food like kebabs and salads added to the local cuisine scene. Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Middle Eastern food can also be found all over Germany.Cafes & Restaurants ($8 and up): Breakfast at a mid-range restaurant costs about $8 - $15. Brunch is popular in Germany, with a hearty meal and coffee at a café costing about $13 - $15. Lunch and dinner at a nice restaurant can cost $10 and up. Beer is cheap and excellent (duh), expect to pay $3 - $5 for a bottle.Things to doTake a road trip from Stuttgart: If you are in Stuttgart in the summer, I’ve got 7 day trips that I think you should check out. From hiking up to a gorgeous waterfall, to seeing castles that look like they bounced out of a fairy tale, and to flying in a hot air balloon, there has to be one day trip that floats your boat, or all seven of them!Check Out Underground Berlin: Not on the typical backpacking radar per se, but Kreuzerg is insanely cool and different from the rest of Berlin. The street art here is world-class, and if you enjoy counterculture, you’ll find tons of awesome happenings in the city. Visit the Christmas Markets: Winter in Germany is cold and dark, but the Christmas markets will make up for it. With a glass of Mulled Wine in one hand, gingerbread on the other, while walking under fairly lights and snowflakes, you will find a way to enjoy the German winter, I am sure. For an authentic German Christmas market experience, check out Hattigen; If you are into anything quirky like me, hit Siegburg. My personal favorite? Aachen, for its gingerbread, primarily.Check out Oktoberfest: The world’s biggest beer festival that stretches over two weeks run from late September to the first weekend in October every year in Germany. The locals typically join the festival for a day, but if you are up for a beery challenge, stay as long as you can, raise your glasses,  and sing a few German beer songs. Just make sure to book accommodation well in advance!Apps to downloadDB Navigator (for train travel planning), MyTaxi (Germany’s version of Uber), Fly Europe Recommended Products"

Finland is a destination that, apart from Helsinki, actually is much better known for its famous winters! Take a sleigh ride and observe how big of a part reindeer play in the culture in Lapland, search for the northern lights, and visit the hotels made entirely of snow and ice!Finns are friendly people, with a killer sense of style and amazingly good English skills.  Quick TipsCurrency: Euro (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: 90-day Schengen visa on arrival for most nationalities (click here for more info)Safety rating: Ranked 14 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.49 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40)Solo Travel Friendliness: Finland is one of the safest countries in the world. You can go for a walk or hike alone at night in Lapland without worrying about your safety – I did that a few times myself. The locals are a warm and friendly bunch, and crime rates are extremely low, but pickpockets are around in crowded areas so always keep an eye on your belongings.Climate: The coldest month is in February and warmest month is in July. Winters are long and cold, especially in the Arctic where temperatures are regularly sub-zero. Midnight sun can be expected in the summer, with temperatures ranging from 55°F to 63°F.Best SIM cards: Elisa (the brand name for prepaid packages is Saunalahti) – cards can be purchased at the airport or official shops. Bring your passport.Random useful tip: Under a unique legal concept known as Everyman’s Right, everybody is allowed to roam Finland’s forests and countryside freely, with exclusions in some areas like natural reserves and military areas. This means you can pretty much pitch a tent and camp anywhere you want in the country.AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($15 - $30): You can camp pretty much anywhere in Finland, so pack your camping gear if you want to save on accommodation - keep in mind that the winters are bitterly cold, though so you’d need some very specialized equipment outside of the summer months. Campsites with amenities cost about $15 - $30 per night. Many hostels are under the HI Network, so sign up for their membership to receive discounts, especially if you plan on staying exclusively in hostels in Finland. Expect to pay $20 - $30 for a night’s stay at a hostel. Wi-Fi is pretty much standard across all hostels, and some hostels offer free breakfast. Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($50 - $80): Hotels in Finland are generally expensive, but one interesting thing to note is that rates are lower during high season – opposite of the norm. Expect to pay $50 - $60 for a basic private room, and $70 - $80 for a double room in a budget hotel. Airbnbs average at around $70 for a private room, and at $130 for an entire unit.FoodCheap Eats ($5 - $15): Economical small meals can be found at market halls, supermarkets, street stands, and in train and bus stations, costing about $5 - $7 for a snack. For a more filling meal, keep an eye out for lunch deals and buffets during lunch time. Sandwiches, pizza, and kebabs are also cheap in most places. Expect to pay $10 - $15 for those.Restaurants and Pubs ($20 and up): Finnish specialities include reindeer and salmon. My personal favorite restaurant in Finland is Pihvikeisari, where everything is local and homemade. Expect to pay about $20 - $40 for a main. The same price range should be expected across other restaurants in Finland with similar quality. Beer costs about $7 - $10. TransportationGetting There: The main international airport is Helsinki Vantaa Airport, located in the capital. Crossing borders overland is possible from St Petersburg to Helsinki by train, or from neighboring countries by car.Getting Around Town: One of the best ways to get around is on a bicycle - assuming the ground isn’t covered by snow. You can rent one from any rental shop for about $15 - $30 per day. Buses are well integrated and reliable. Look into getting a connection pass if you are staying for more than a couple of days. Taxis are expensive and I’d only recommend getting into one if you are sharing the fare with others. Unfortunately, Uber has recently pulled its primary service out of Finland until 2018, and the only service available is the luxurious UberBlack.Inter-city Traveling: Buses are the cheapest option, with a single trip ticket from Turku to Helsinki costing as low as $15. Book as far in advance as possible to get discounted rate. Trains are a more comfortable, but also a more expensive, option. Expect to pay about $5 - $10 more than buses for trains. For overnight trains, try to get in a proper sleeper car as other classes may be too uncomfortable for a good night’s rest. The best way to get around Finland, in my opinion, is to rent a car, which will give you ultimate freedom. Driving in the Finnish winter is, shall we say, interesting but not impossible!Things to DoGo Dog Sledding in Lapland: Dog Sledding is actually a North American tradition, but the conditions in Lapland are perfect for the dogs, who do best in solid, dry snow, which occurs when it’s particularly cold outside. Based on what I’ve read and seen myself, the dogs were probably having more fun than their passengers, just make sure you pick a company that treats the dogs right. Ski at Äkäslompolo: Skiing in Äkäslompolo was an altogether different experience compared to skiing elsewhere. It feels so incredibly secluded, so profoundly quiet, and so calmingly peaceful. There are only four ski runs, but they’re wide and uncrowded. If you don’t alpine ski, Nordic skiing and snowshoeing are also popular.Go for a Sauna Gondola in Lapland: Sitting and relaxing in a streaming wooden room is perfect, especially when it’s crisp and cold outside. At the ski resort in Ylläs, you can actually rent a sauna gondola and afterwards you can drink beer, go in the jacuzzi outside, and use the other sauna inside as well. Do this when you are in group, as the total cost can be hefty. If you are not in a big group or simply do not find sauna appealing, here are 12 other things to do in Lapland.Do a Northern Lights Safari: I was a bit unlucky with the weather and had cloud cover when I hunted for the Northern Lights, but Northern Finland is one of the most popular places to see the Northern Lights. Do your research on the weather forecast and go with a tour company (as they have more experience and therefore more knowledge on viewing possibility). It’s something you will never get tired of seeing.Stay at a Ice Hotel: I visited two ice hotels while I was in Finnish Lapland – Snowman World in Rovaniemi, and Snow Village in Kittilä. Everything was made of ice (duh) and one of them even had a church where people get married! If you have the budget, spend a night in one of them for a unique hotel experience. Expect to pay about $150 for a night.Visit the Capital: Helsinki is a beautiful ancient city filled with gorgeous architecture, artwork, museums, and friendly locals. It’s the perfect place to get to know Finland, and an equally perfect place to kick back and relax, as the capital has no shortage of cozy and hip cafes.Apps to DownloadCity-Opas (tourism service provider), Whim (Public Transportation Hub in Helsinki) Recommended Products"

If you're looking to Greece for a summer adventure, consider some of the smaller islands in the popular chains for a similar experience without the crowds, and hefty prices.When it comes to Greece, the perfect summer, Mediterranean experience is available in many different forms.

There are some political internal conflicts in the country, but you are highly unlikely to encounter any in tourist areas.Solo Travel Friendliness: With friendly locals and a relaxing atmosphere, Greece is great for solo travelers. However, petty theft is on the rise due to the economic crisis, so be mindful of your belongings especially when traveling in the large cities.Climate: Peak season starts from June - September, with July and August being the hottest and busiest months. Winter (December - February) gets pretty cold and may not be pleasant for traveling. Shoulder seasons (April - June and September - October) see smaller crowds and reduced prices, though some islands shut down their tourism operations by October and don't reopen until May. Best SIM cards: Cosmote – cards can be purchased at the airport but only offer huge bundles. Bring your passport.Random Useful Tip: Greeks LOVE to hear how much you enjoy the food at their restaurants, so be sure to let them know!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($10 - $18): In popular areas like Santorini, Athens and Crete, you can find hostels that cost about $10-$18 per night. For a bit more privacy on a budget, plan your trip way ahead and you could score a private room for as low as $16 per night.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($44 - $100): A night at a decent, 3-star hotel costs about $50 - $100. Airbnbs may be a much better alternative, with a private room averaging $44 a night, and an entire unit averaging at $106, both tend to be much more comfortable than a hotel room.FoodStreet Food and Cooking Your Own Food ($5 - $10): Want to eat your way around Greece on the cheap? Look for gyros, which is very similar to a kebab, pies and breads. They shouldn’t cost more than $5 and can easily fill you up. If your accommodation comes with a kitchen, head down to the local market and you will find fresh produce and seafood at reasonable prices. Budget about $50 for a week’s worth of groceries. Local Restaurants ($15 - $30): Fresh food like vegetables, seafood and bread can be easily found all over the islands, and I think that’s what makes the food in Greece so great! The Greeks love dining out and dinners typically start late. Many Greek foods are great for sharing, so if you are traveling solo, I recommend staying in a social hostel so you can make new friends and sample some amazing Greek food together. Expect to pay about $15 - $30 for a full meal. TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Athens International Airport and Heraklion International Airport, both of which receive many direct flights from all over central Europe. Scenic train and bus rides are available from neighboring countries including Albania and Bulgaria. You can also take a ferry if you are coming from eastern Italy.Getting Around town: If you are in the major cities, the public transportation systems are affordable and convenient. You can easily get around on about $2 per ride. Outside of the major cities, or on the islands, you may consider renting a car (if traveling in a group) or a motorcycle (if traveling solo). That said, road safety isn’t exactly reputable in Greece, and roads are incredibly narrow in places, so only do so if you are a confident driver/rider, and make sure to get insured. You'll need an international driver's license.Inter-city Traveling: You can take long distance buses, which are all under the KTEL network, pretty much all over Greece. On the other hand, most people would recommend against taking the trains in Greece. If you want to minimize travel time, domestic flights are affordable and frequent. To get from one island to another, your obvious choice is taking a ferry. Seats can sell out quickly especially in the busy months, so book your tickets way ahead of time, if possible!Things to DoGo on an Island Hopping Excursion: What better way to take in the blue waters and gorgeous islands than renting a private boat and go on an epic excursion?! It's inexpensive if shared with a group of people. Many boat rental companies come with a professional crew so all that's left to do is to enjoy your time on the boat. However, if you have a license, I think it'd be very cool to sail independently as well. Island hopping Greece is such a beautiful experience, it is a must-do when in Greece!Explore the Ruins: From the Acropolis in Athens, to the ancient city of Kamiros, Greece is full of impressive sites that will help you gain a better understanding of the western civilization history and myths. They are all very popular and can get crowded during the day, so try getting to these sites early in the morning for a quieter experience.Enjoy the Views at Santorini: Who hasn't seen the photos of Santorini, with beautiful sun rays beaming on the bluest water right below equally beautiful white washed buildings? The backdrop of Santorini is so iconic, you probably had it as your desktop wallpaper at some point! If you truly have your heart set on seeing the views, I recommend staying in one of the nice hotels in Oia, so you can enjoy the sunset peacefully.See Myrtos Beach in Kefalonia: Myrtos Beach is deemed as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. The water is incredibly blue, and in the backdrop you will find dramatic cliffs and beautiful pine trees. There are also other stunning beaches in Kefalonia that are worth a visit.Go to the birthplace of the Olympics: Did you know that to take part in the Olympics in ancient times, one had to be freeborn, Greek, a man, and naked? If you are a history buff, you probably already have this item on your list! It's a lot of fun walking through the Olympia, trying to picture what was it like back in the day."

While worthwhile to visit, the rest of the island nation has some of the most interesting and varied landscapes, cultures, and cuisines in all of Southeast Asia. From the jungles of Sumatra, to the underwater rainbow of Komodo and all of the islands in between, around, and besides them, one could easily travel this archipelago for years.Indonesia is an outdoorsy person's dream.

Bahasha is also a pretty easy language to pick up, and the longer you spend amongst locals and learning various words, the more immersed you can become. Moreover, the food in Indonesia is delicious. In Sumatra, it involves tons of avocados and passion fruit, in Bali, there's a cuisine all its own, and in the other islands, prepare for delicious tempeh and cashews, soups galore, and gado gado, which is peanut sauce over vegetables.

However, in other places, I was moved by the sincerity and kindness of the locals. My advice is to be mindful always, and trust your instinctsClimate: Hot and humid year-round. Rainy season lasts from November to MarchBest SIM cards: 3 is very cheap and works in major cities in Java and Sumatra, Telkomsel works best on the islandsModesty Considerations: In most of Indonesia, with the exception of Bali which is Hindu, women will have their shoulders, knees, and usually heads covered. Short shorts and tank tops are not recommended here for womenRandom useful tip: The language (especially accent), cuisine, religion, and culture changes wildly from island to islandAccommodationLow Budget Traveler ($5 - $15): Cost of accommodation varies across the country, and there are fewer dorms available in Indonesia as compared to countries that are more firmly on the banana pancake trail. That said, you can still find hostels and homestays that are cheap and basic. Expect to pay around $5 - $10 for a bed in less visited areas like Bukit Lawang and Sumatra, and $10 - $15 in popular areas like Bali and Java.Mid Budget Traveler ($15 - $30): Single rooms are uncommon so if you are a solo traveler seeking privacy, expect to pay the price for two for a private room, though some hotels may charge you 75% of the full price if you are the only occupant. In some areas on the islands, you can get a basic chalet for around the same price range. Airbnbs are widespread in Indonesia, expect to pay about $10 for a private room, and about $25 for an entire unit. In the rural areas, with permission from the local authorities, you can stay with locals in a village for a small fee (there’s often no fixed price, and the hosting family cooks and shares meals with you).FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 - $5): I love to eat at a warung (directly translated as “little store”) filled with locals, where you can order a full meal with less than $1. Indonesian food is delicious and cheap so eat out as much as you can. Some of my personal favorites are Soto Ayam (chicken noodle soup), Sate (grilled meat on a stick), and nasi campur (rice with various dishes). If you are in Indonesia during the fasting month, or Ramadan, (normally during mid-year), keep a lookout for Ramadan bazaars, where the locals sell food, snacks, cakes, drinks and more in a market after sundown.Cafes & Restaurants ($5 - $10): A meal at a mid-range restaurant will cost about $5, typically serving the same type of food you can get from warungs, but with better quality ingredients and fancier drinks. In Bali, the vegan culture is very prominent, and you can find affordable vegan cafes dotted along the streets of Bali, with a big bowl of salad and a huge glass of smoothie costing less than $7. There are also high end restaurants, normally located in hotels and beachfront, that cost $10 and up for a meal. A large Bintang beer costs about $2.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Sukarno-Hatta Airport at Jakarta, and Ngurah Rai Airport at Bali. Various direct flights are available from Australia and most parts of Southeast Asia. Ferries are also available from Malaysia and Singapore.Getting Around Town: When in Indonesia, make sure to install the Go-Jek application on your phone. It is a local company that provides bike and car taxi services on an app, and beyond that, you can even order food, delivery services, massages and more from the same app. Taking the local bus is also incredibly cheap and for some reason, I did not see any other tourists on them. You can also rent a bike from shops and hostels, which in my opinion is the best way to get around as you can stop whenever you want to admire the beautiful rice fields or to say ‘hello’ to the locals.Inter-city Traveling: Indonesia is huge, and traveling from one city to another can be expensive and time-consuming, if you do not plan wisely. Plan your routes ahead so you don’t end up going back and forth and wasting money. I learnt it the hard way when traveling from Sumatra to Flores. Buses and trains are comfortable and affordable, so are domestic flights if booked ahead. Traveling between the islands can be cheap if you follow the locals and take the local boats, sometimes costing as low as $0.5 to get from one island to another. Things to DoClimb Mount Bromo: This volcano sits at the Eastern end of Java between Surabaya and Yogyakarta and is quite often lumped in as part of a tour heading out of one of those two cities. The view is gorgeous, the trek fun and completely doable, and you can go really close to the volcano itself. It is possible to do climb Bromo independently without a guide.Visit Borobudur: This UNESCO World Heritage Site is the world’s largest Buddhist temple. I have not been there myself, but based on what I’ve read, it is a place not to be missed. The best time to go is in the early morning, which requires you to wake up at 3am so that you will be able to watch the sunrise. You can get a free tour from local students looking to practice their English.Learn to surf: If you mention the name Indonesia anywhere in the world, you will more than likely excitedly be told about the incredible waves and how much of a surfing paradise it is. Specifically, Bali is the perfect location for any adventurous soul hoping to learn to surf. Click on the link for a detailed guide on where to surf in Bali.Chill on the Gili Islands: There are a total of 3 islands that make up the Gili Islands. Gili Trawangan is the largest of the 3, it is more established and overall a good party island; Gili Meno is the complete opposite, with very little party and very much the perfect place to chill; Gili Air is a little bit in between the two. The best part is all 3 islands are within minutes’ reach from each other.Trek Kawah Ijen: This was one of the most brilliant parts of my trip in Indonesia. The volcano itself is absolutely stunning - and do not miss the blue flames! It is totally worth it to leave your guesthouse at 1am to catch the sunrise. Here’s how you can do it independently without a tour.See the Orangutans in Bukit Lawang: There are many reasons to like Bukit Lawang. It is a place where everyone knows your name, where people arrive intending to stay for a few days and end up making it their home for a year. The cherry on top? You get to see the magnificent (yet adorable, how do they do it?!) Orangutans and gibbons in the jungle of Bukit Lawang.Climb Mount Rinjani: If you are looking for an advanced trek, look no further than Mount Rinjani. I took on a 3D2N trek and it got more and more challenging by the day – even the local guides put on real shoes! But, it is one of my favorite treks ever and the views were worth everything.See the Dragons and Dive in Komodo Islands: Visit the Komodo National Park and hang out with the komodo dragons. They are huge, swim real fast, and their saliva is venomous so keep a safe distance – your guide will not let you get too close anyway. I also did a live-abroad 6 day diving trip in the Komodo Islands and it was one of the best dive trips of my life – a manta ray came up real close, almost touching me.Apps to DownloadGO-JEK (transportation, food delivery, and door-to-door massage hub), Traveloka (Indonesian version of Skyscanner) Recommended Products"

Ireland is famed for its céad míle fáilte (hundred thousand welcomes), and I indeed felt welcome during my times there, as a solo traveler. The country is also safe and easy to get around.Climate: Get ready for clouds and rain year-round with winter temperatures reaching sub-zeroBest SIM cards: Tesco mobile for lots of cheap data - buy at the storeRandom useful tip: Irish people don't really like it when you claim to be Irish thanks to your heritage. AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($15 - $30): Expect to pay about $15 - $20 for a basic dorm room outside of popular towns. In cities like Dublin, a dorm room may cost about $20 - $30. Overall, Ireland has many well located hostels with good facilities. Staying true to the céad míle fáilte spirit, expect to find a good atmosphere and friendly hosts at most hostels. The only catch is that the good ones get booked out really quickly, especially closer to St. Patrick’s Day and Christmas, so book as far in advance as you can. Couchsurfing is also very popular in all major cities in Ireland.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($40 - $80): A private hostel room starts at around $40 - $60, with most inclusive of free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Budget hotels start at around $55 - $70. Expect to pay about $70 - $80 for a private room at a mid-range hotel. Airbnbs are popular in Ireland, with a private room averaging at $65, and an entire unit averaging at $140.Other Accommodation Options: If you have the budget to splurge, check out the possibility of staying in a real castle in Ireland. The country is home to some of the most beautiful castles in the world, and many of them have turned into accommodation for those who fantasize waking up in a castle. You can also build your own castle – a.k.a pitch a tent and camp at one of the many campsites in Ireland.FoodCheap Eats ($10 - $15): Food in Dublin is expensive, but you can get creative and cook your own meals. Check out the local farmers markets where you can get fresh ingredients that cost much less than eating out. When you do eat out, keep an eye on restaurants that offer early bird deals and just have your lunch and dinner earlier - particularly in small towns where restaurants close early. Outside of Dublin, expect to pay about $10 - $15 for a simple meal at a restaurant or pub. A pint of Guinness costs about $5.Restaurants and Pubs ($20 and up): Expect to pay $20 - $35 for a decent meal with a drink in a restaurant in Ireland. Most pubs in Ireland serve food – not bar food but actual meals like meat stew, sandwiches, and more, often at a reasonable price range. While Ireland has never been popular for its cuisine, the new generation of chefs are working on changing this perception by recreating traditional Irish dishes with fresh, local produce. I especially enjoyed the seafood in Galway and along the Wild Atlantic Way. One big tip is to look out for Good Food Ireland signs for high quality restaurants.TransportationGetting There: The main international airport with the most tourist traffic is Dublin Airport. Though you should look into the 4 other international airports as the flight tickets could be a lot cheaper. It is also possible to take a combination of a train and ferry from Britain to Ireland. Another option is by bus, which could be cheaper than taking the train, though it would take much longer.Getting Around Town: Buses and trains are the cheapest way to get around town in Ireland. They are comprehensive and really comfortable, with free Wi-Fi on all buses and trains! In Dublin, there is a bike-sharing scheme, which costs about $1.20 per trip. Though if you ask for my honest opinion, most cities are best explored on foot. Bring an umbrella! Inter-city Traveling: Given Ireland’s size, traveling from one city to another is quick and easy, best with trains and buses. A single train ride from Dublin to Galway costs about $45 and takes about 2.5 hours. Bus rides typically cost $10 less than trains. To see areas that are unreachable by public transport, consider renting a car, which could be inexpensive if you can find someone to share the ride with, or if you opt for a smaller model. Expect to pay $30 per day for a small car. Keep in mind that you’ll be driving on the left and the roads are often narrow. Things to Do‘Craic’ it up in Dublin: Dublin is the best place in Ireland to party and enjoy a night full of craic. Ask your hostel for pub recommendation, order yourself a pint of the country’s most loved export – Guinness, and prepare for a good night out. During the day, admire the city’s beautiful architecture, visit the museums and galleries (most of them are free!), and tour the country’s oldest university, Trinity College.Explore the Wild Atlantic Way: WAW is a road that wraps around the island and is the longest coastal drive in the world. Start from Galway and drive along the coast to Clifden, passing through the Silver Strand and Two Dogs Bay. From Clifden, continue to Kylemore Abbey, Killary, and end your road trip at Donegal. If you don’t feel like ending it right there, continue into Northern Ireland, my favorite part of the island.Play Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland: Put on a cape, bring your (plastic) sword, and head to one of the many GoT filming locations in Ireland. Even if you are not a fan of the show, The Giant’s Causeway, the beautiful forest, the mesmerizing castles, and a huge cave called Cushendun will ensure an unforgettable experience, and they aren’t even all that Northern Ireland has to offer!Walk in Connemara: For an off the beaten path adventure, hire a car and drive to Connemara on a Sunday, and join the walking groups to experience some of this rugged coastline. It is a part of Ireland that is still relatively wild and rugged, and the population remains low, which makes for a fairly interesting region to explore for those who are not a fan of tourist areas.Cycle the Great Western Greenway: Hop on a bicycle and explore the western Irish coast from Westport to Achill. I recommend stopping for a night at one of the cottages along Cnoc Suain, which is incredibly peaceful and warmly welcoming at the same time.Celebrate St. Patrick’s Day: Originated as a feast day for the Irish patron saint, St. Patrick’s Day is more of a secular festival celebrated globally these days. If you find yourself in Ireland on St. Patrick’s Day, dress up in green, head down to a local pub or join the parade, and dance your day away to Irish music.Apps to DownloadWild Atlantic Way (great navigation and tips all around Ireland), Iarnrod Eireann (train timetables and real-time information) Recommended Products"
https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Iceland-guide/,Iceland guide,Iceland,"Iceland is a land of extremes - extreme weather, extreme landscapes, and extreme beauty. The way that the country changes constantly as one drives through is mind-boggling, and there are so many waterfalls that it's pointless to try to count them all. Each vista becomes more spectacular than the last and the particularly lucky even get to see the most spectacular feat of nature: the aurora borealis. Even though Iceland is well on the tourist trail these days, that doesn't mean you can't get plenty of amazing experiences and sights all to yourself. The following posts are full of tips and beautiful photos to help you plan out your perfect Iceland holiday, chase the northern lights, and pursue the most adventurous yet affordable and comfortable trip possible.  Iceland is a land of extremes - extreme weather, extreme landscapes, and extreme beauty.

The following posts are full of tips and beautiful photos to help you plan out your perfect Iceland holiday, chase the northern lights, and pursue the most adventurous yet affordable and comfortable trip possible.  Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Icelandic: “Halló” and “Takk Fyrir”Currency: Icelandic króna (click here for current conversion rates)Visa:90-day Schengen visa on arrival for most nationalities (click here for more info)Safety rating:Ranked 1 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.07 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40), meaning Iceland is currently the safest country in the world!Climate:Weather is unpredictable and changes rapidly – invest in good quality gear to keep yourself warm and dry. Summer comes with possibility of 24 hours of daylight during the magnificent Midnight Sun, and Winter the opposite; Autumn offers pleasant weather and beautiful color-changing leavesBest SIM cards: Vodafone – cards can be purchased at the airport, major convenience stores and petrol stations. IDs and passports are not requiredRandom useful tip: Be prepared to get naked in the showers before going swimming in Iceland – it is mandatory and there are even bath guards that ensure you have washed your body well enough before entering the poolAccommodationLow budget solo travelers ($30 - $60): Hostels in Iceland are pretty much monopolized by HI Network so it will make sense to sign up for their membership to get discount, especially if you are planning on staying exclusively in hostels. An important tip is to book your accommodation in advance, as the ones with excellent reviews and low pricing get booked out quickly.Mid budget solo travelers ($100 - $150): Expect to pay more than $100 for a private room with shared bathrooms. Expect to pay a lot more for a private bathroom. Hotels are really expensive in Iceland and I would suggest opting for other options, unless privacy and comfort are a priority.Other accommodation options: Camper van is the best accommodation option in my opinion. It costs almost the same as staying at hostels, except that you are able to camp right next to a glacier lagoon, or a famous waterfall if you want to. You can also consider couchsurfing and Airbnbs. Find a full range of suggestions by town here.TransportationGetting Around: It is pretty straightforward to get around Iceland. If you visit Iceland in the Summer, you can obtain the “Bus Passports” – there are different companies offering different routes and packages so do your research beforehand. Car rental allows you to stop whenever and wherever you want and I highly recommend getting a 4X4 camper van to conquer the road condition in some areas. Gas is expensive in Iceland but it is definitely doable when split between two or more people. Depending on weather, cycling and hitchhiking are also good ways to get around.Inter-city Traveling: Inter-city traveling is easy in the Summer, as you can catch a bus or fly to all major centres from Reykjavik. However, things could get tricky during Winter, as reduced bus service and road condition may limit your option to flying only. Keep the same thing in mind if you are planning to rent a car. Again, I highly recommend getting a 4X4 camper van, which could be the only way to help you get through the gravel.FoodGrocery Shop & Cook Your Own Food ($5 - $15): Food is not going to be the most exciting part of your trip in Iceland. It is expensive to eat out, and if you are traveling with a camper van that will most likely come with a sink, stove and cookware, your best bet is to grocery shop and cook your own food. The cheapest grocery stores are Kronan, Netto, and Bonus. Most of the cheaper stores are closer to Reykjavik, so stock up on imperishables before you leave. Also, water in Iceland is free and safe to drink so bring your own bottle and save yourself $3 / bottled water.Eating Out ($20 and up): Expect to pay at least $20 for a main. If you want to eat out, stick with lunch specials and fixed-price set meals. Other options include hot dog vendors that are everywhere, petrol stations that are well-stocked with pre-made fast food.Alcohol: Fun fact - alcohol was banned in Iceland until 1989. If you think you’ll want alcoholic drinks during your trip, make your purchases in duty free before you leave your home or at Reykjavik airport. You can find liquor outside of the airport but they’re expensive and beer is weak and expensive as well. Expect to pay about $7 - $10 for a beer during happy hours.Things to doIceland Ring Road: This can be done with a tour or independently. I recommend doing it independently as the drive alone makes an unforgettable experience. Allocate a minimum of 7 days for this. Hike and camp at Landmannalaugar, wake up to a massive waterfall at Seljalandsfoss, visit Fjaðrárgljúfur, a canyon that was likely created during the last ice age, admire the glacier lagoon and northern lights, and visit more waterfalls (Aldeyjarfoss is my favorite!). Read the full itinerary here.The Golden Circle: Allocate one day for Iceland’s Golden Circle, starting early in the morning so that you can fully enjoy each stop. Start from Þingvellir, a national park full of cultural, historical, and natural significance for Iceland. Proceed to Haukadalur next and watch the geyser that shoots up every 5-6 minutes, a phenomena cause by the volcanic activities underneath the surface. Drive towards Gullfoss to see the 105 feet deep waterfall, check out the lakes, hike Krýsuvík, and end your day with a visit to the Icelandic horses. Read the full itinerary here.The Blue Lagoon: I suggest making The Blue Lagoon your last stop before heading to the airport. Yes it is touristic and crowded, but it’s still magnificent and out-of-the-world. This huge and dreamy spa originates its water 2000 metres below the surface, and its temparature is generally 98°F - 104°F, with water warmer in some places than others so move around to get the best spot.National Parks: You will be happy to find out that all national parks in Iceland are free. There are 3 national parks in Iceland and if time allows, visit all 3 of them - Thingvellir National Park houses the largest lake in Iceland, Snæfellsjökull National Park is referred to as “Iceland in a miniature”, and Vatnajökull national Park offers the most powerful waterfall in all of Europe.Whale Watching: The best time to do this is from April to September, when it is playtime for the 23 whale species found in Iceland. While there’s no guarantee, as there shouldn’t be, they were spotted 98% of the time in 2015. Take the chance, you have nothing to lose!Snorkel at Silfra Lava Fissure: I did not get to do this (and I regret it so much!) but you should snorkel at Silfra Lava Fissure, a crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site 45 minutes away from Reyjavik. The water is clean and clear enough that you can drink it while snorkeling. Apps to download112 Iceland (it sends your location to response center and track your locations.

Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Italian: ""Ciao"" and ""Grazie""Currency: Euro (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: Visa free for most nationalities in North and South America (including US, Canada and Mexico), Australia, Schengen area of Europe (even looser there with ID requirements, just a national ID or passport if don't have that), and a few others.  A 90-day Schengen visa on arrival for most other nationalities (click here for more info).Safety rating: Ranked 39 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.75 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40)Solo Travel Friendliness: Italy is a lovely place to travel alone in. I felt deep affection from people I’ve met, and was never in a situation where I questioned my own safety. Surely, the Italian men are known for being amorous but usually harmless – learn to say “no” firmly. Beware of pickpockets in cities like Rome and Florence.Climate: Dependent on part of the country, but prepare for warm and dry summers and, if in the north, snow in the winter for some awesome skiingBest SIM cards: Tim and Vodafone – cards can be purchased at the airport. Bring your passport.Random Useful Tip: Just because the Italy you see in movies depicts Venice, Tuscany, and Rome, doesn't mean that's the best of the country. Get off the tourist path and check out some other spots! They've turned out to be my favorite after exploring much of the more touristy parts of the country in my early 20s.AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($20 - $30): In the touristy cities, expect to pay at least $25 for a basic dorm bed, and in areas outside the major cities, you can find dorms for around $20. Personally, I recommend checking out couchsurfing as it not only saves money, but also provides a more localized experience. For instance, I stayed with a med student in Bologna in 2013, who not only provided me a place to stay, but also gave me a motorbike tour around the city and took me to a lovely dinner in a chateau overlooking the city. It was awesome!Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($50 - $100): A private room in a hostel costs about $50 per night, where amenities may be basic but free Wi-Fi and breakfast are usually included. A nicer hotel can cost around $70 - $100 for a private room. Airbnbs may be a much better alternative, with a private room averaging $55 a night, and an entire unit averaging at $90, both could be much more comfortable than a hotel room.FoodFood is perhaps Italy’s middle name. I have visited Italy a few times now, and each time, admittedly, what excites me the most is being able to eat true Italian cuisine again. It’s not just about pasta and pizza, but delicious meat dishes, balsamic, fresh cheese, and gelato as well. It is only right that you leave the country with 5 pounds added to your belly. Emilia Romagna is the first place where I started to appreciate the importance of food. I highly recommend finding ways to eat with locals – think ingredients freshly picked from the family garden, laughter in the kitchen and on the table, and true Italian delicacies.A slice of pizza from the local pizzerias or a light snack costs about $5; a meal with a glass of wine at a restaurant costs around $15 - $20. Keep a lookout for set lunch promotions. Markets and bakeries are also great spots for fresh food and pastries. Aperitivo is also a great way to sample tapas-style food in small restaurants and bars, and a great way to rub shoulders with locals while saving money as well. Though in all honesty, this is one category where you should splurge at least once when it comes to Italy – you are in for a treat! TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Milan-Malpensa Airport, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport (Rome), Galileo Galilei Airport (Pisa), and Florence Airport (Florence, called ""Firenze"" in Italian if go to the airport website). All airports are well connected to most major flights. Train traveling is a popular way to get to Italy from most parts of Europe and the UK, as it offers a scenic ride and you can make stops along the way. Advanced booking will save you money and is required for Eurail pass holders. Getting Around town: Trains in Italy are cheap and efficient, with a single trip rarely costing more than $2. City buses cover routes that trains don’t reach, and generally follow a flat rate of about $1. Cycling is a popular mode of transport in much of Italy, though the drivers are, for lack of a better word, notoriously crazy, so it's really your call. Most hostels will be happy to help you take care of your bike overnight.Inter-city Traveling: Italy’s extensive train system makes getting from one city to another a breeze. High speed trains can take you from Naples to Rome in about an hour. Ticket prices for the high speed trains are about $40 - $70. For a cheaper alternative, go for the regional trains that cost about $7 - $30 per trip. Domestic airlines are available and there are often special discounts at the start of each season, though it’s usually best to book flights at least two months in advance.Things to DoTake a Cooking Class: There is no better place to learn how to make Italian food than in Italy itself. Personally, I took one at a small restaurant in a small countryside town just outside of Bologna, learning how to create fresh pasta in 2013, and did another cooking class the following year. Besides picking up a new skill, it will also help you appreciate Italian cuisine even more.Explore Florence: Beautiful museums, galleries, architecture, sculptures, churches, gardens… Florence is beautiful and you can easily spend an entire week wandering about without noticing the time passing. Celebrate Thanksgiving: ...with an Italian twist! Törggelen is a local thanksgiving tradition that stretches over a month every year in South Tyrol, the Alpine region of Italy. The celebration consists of long meals of several courses shared with family, friends, and co-workers, typically at a farmhouse. You can find out how to participate in a Törggelen celebration here. Rock Climb in the Dolomites: There is one big reason why most people visit South Tyrol – The Dolomites, a rock formation which has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The best way to see them is up close through a via ferrata –  a fixed-route climb equipped with cables and ladders. I recommend doing this in the autumn as shoulder season means smaller crowds, and you will get to see the beautiful changing leaves.Go On a Camper Van Adventure: I went on a camper van adventure in South Tyrol and I cannot recommend it enough, especially if you are a hiking and camping enthusiast like me. It’s a great way to tick multiple boxes at once, really, as it works as your accommodation and transportation, and you get to go and stop pretty much wherever you want. Consider travel insurance for this as well.  Recommended Products"

Aside from the potential language barrier, solo travelers tend to enjoy Japan, and the locals are always happy to help. Eating alone is not only acceptable but a total norm in Japan. In fact, you will find single seats in most restaurants.Climate: Spring (March - May) can have a mix of weather, to bring layers for both warm and cold temperatures. In winter (December - February), prepare for cold weather and snow. Summer (June - August) gets pretty dry and hot, though it’d be perfect if you are hoping to surf or dive in places like Okinawa and Kamakura. In the fall, (September - November) the weather is mild and again layers are best.When to go: Overall, Japan is good to visit during anytime of the year, but avoid Golden Week (end of April - beginning of May) if possible, as you will be fighting for space not only with the tourists but also the locals who are on holiday. Spring is high season as people around the world flock to Japan to see the beautiful cherry blossoms. In the winter, it’s a snowy wonderland, though flights to popular ski destinations like Hokkaido can get expensive. If you want to avoid big crowds, visit Japan in the fall (September - November). The weather is beautiful, the fall foliage is gorgeous, and there are slightly fewer people around.Best SIM cards: NTT Domoco - SIM card can be purchased online and collected at the airport or hotel. Another popular option to get data in Japan is to rent a Pocket WiFi device, which is great and possibly less expensive if you are sharing in a group. Sometimes hotels provide MiFis as well.Random useful tip: Always have cash with you and bring a coin purse! Cash is preferred over credit cards, though some places do accept them. Opt for a backpack over a suitcase as there will be lots of stairs, and leave room in your luggage for shopping!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($20 - $30): Unless you are couchsurfing, which is popular and an interesting way of soaking in the local culture in Japan, accommodation in Japan is pretty costly, compared to the rest of Asia. However, most hostels are spotless, strategically located, and well facilitated, so you do get what you pay for. There are also many capsule hotels around Japan (click to explore!), which are essentially an upgraded version of a hostel - bigger bed space, full amenities, more privacy, and some of them even come with an in-house sento. Expect to pay about $20 - $25 for a hostel room in the city center, and about $25 - $30 for a night at a capsule hotel.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($30 and up): Private accommodation can be pretty costly in Japan, especially in popular cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka. A room at a mid-range hotel can easily cost $50 - $80 per night, and if you are looking for luxury, the sky's the limit. If you are considering Airbnb, make sure that the registration number of the listing is stated clearly, as the local government has recently shut down thousands of listings without a registration number.TransportationGetting There: There are several international airports in Japan that are well connected with most major airlines. The busiest airports are Tokyo’s Narita Airport, followed by Osaka’s Kansai Airport, and Nagoya’s Central Japan Airport, of which you are likely to begin or end your Japan trip in. Quite a number of airlines offer direct flights from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.Getting Around: Be prepared to be blown away by how complex the rail system is in Japan. It is convenient and wide spread, but also overwhelming, especially for first-timers. There are various lines and routes so it would be very helpful to download the Hyperdia app and use it to navigate your way around the city. The train tickets are actually quite costly but you will find online agents selling passes at a discounted rate. Have at least a rough idea of where you are going and see if purchasing a pass is worth it. Public buses are punctual and convenient as well. Taxis in Japan can be very expensive (a trip from the city center to the airport could cost you hundreds of dollars) so you’ll want to reserve them for short and urgent trips only. Uber is available in big cities but it has yet to really catch on in Japan.Inter-city Traveling: Taking the Shinkansen (bullet train) is an experience itself. It is punctual to the second, and the train’s speed can go up to 198 miles per hour, yet you’d barely notice it. Tickets are expensive, but you can purchase a JR Pass, which costs about 280 USD - 570 USD, depending on the valid dates. The hefty price is worth it if you are planning to do a lot of inter-city traveling during your stay. For travelers on a budget, your best bet is buses, which are much cheaper but also comfortable and reliable. To put things into perspective, a bus ticket from Tokyo to Kyoto costs about 27 USD, and the journey takes about 8 hours, whereas a Shinkansen train ride costs about 130 USD, and the journey takes only 2 hours 20 minutes.FoodConvenience Stores and Cook Your Own Food ($3 - $5): There will be at least one convenience store at every corner of Japan. Food choices at the convenience stores like Family Mart and 7-11 may surprise you with a variety of warm and cold food, snacks and full meals, starters and desserts, and so on. One could spend a day eating just convenience store food in Japan! If your accommodation has a kitchen, you can also buy groceries from the local supermarkets and cook your own meals.Restaurants & Bars ($15 and up): The Japanese take their food seriously. Most chefs spend their whole life perfecting their dishes behind the kitchen counter, using only the freshest ingredients they can find. You don’t have to go to an expensive restaurant to experience that - even a small ramen establishment offers memorable meals to its customers. One thing about the restaurants in Japan is that if it’s really good, they tend to keep it to themselves. This means no English menu, and no marketing on social media. For that reason, I recommend joining a food tour (most hostels offer that) that’s guided by a local. If you are ready to splurge, ask around for a kaiseki restaurant recommendation, though some require reservations weeks ahead.Things to DoKaiseki dining experience: A Kaiseki course is the epitome of Japanese haute cuisine and is considered the highest-level genre of restaurant in Japan. It is more than just a dining experience, it is an art form that I’ve learned to appreciate after having the opportunity to dine at a all-female chef Kaiseki restaurant in Tokyo, and I urge you to try the same.Japanese Tea Ceremony: A ceremonial preparation and presentation of Japanese green tea will help you learn more about the culture and appreciate the beauty and intricacies of what seems like a simple act - drinking tea. You will find places offering Japanese tea ceremony experiences all over Japan, but particularly in Kyoto. In some places, the ceremony is led by a Geisha, and they sometimes even offer for you to dress up in Kimono for a complete experience.Check out some themed cafes: While we are unsure of the linkage between Japan and themed cafes, one thing’s certain - they are incredibly popular and creative in this country. From robots, to monsters, anime, maids, and animals, you will find something that’s up your alley. Based on my personal experience, these themed cafes are more about the fun and less about the food, but that’s kind of expected of themed cafes in general. As for animal cafes, do your research and if something feels off, it’s best to avoid them.Spend a day at the theme park: In Tokyo alone, there are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea; outside of Tokyo, there’s Universal Studio in Osaka, Fuji Q Highland at the foot of Mount Fuji, and the list goes on. There are some smaller scales ones built in the bubble economy, which I think could also be very interesting to visit.Have a picnic at the park: Japan has some truly gorgeous parks with beautiful views and a relaxing ambience. Pack some light snacks from the convenience store and head to the nearest park for a quiet afternoon of people watching. Not only does it make for a good break from all of that intense traveling in Japan, it’s also a good way to take a closer look at the locals’ lifestyle. You will see mothers taking their children for a walk, elder people reading by the pond, and couples holding hands, which are all calming and pretty to see.Visit the beautiful shrines: Japanese shrines are typically massive and at times, chaotic thanks to the surge of tourists. However, if you visit early in the morning, the atmosphere is much calmer. You will see locals paying respect on their way to work, volunteers cleaning the space, and sometimes, monks chanting in the hallway. Some iconic shrines in Japan include the Meiji-shrine in Tokyo, Kiyomizu-dera in Kyoto, and Hozen-ji in Osaka.Take a bullet train ride: A Shinkansen (bullet train) ride is Japan in a nutshell - precise, efficient, and punctual. The bullet trains are so punctual that you can miss your ride by being 2 seconds late. They are so fast yet you may barely notice the speed from your seat. The Shikansen meals are often the highlight of one’s ride. You can expect no-nonsense, colorfully and carefully packaged meals that you can devor while making your way from one city to another in no time.Dress up in kimono: I mean, what better way to fully soak in the Japanese culture than dressing the part, right? In Kyoto, you will find dozens of kimono rental shops with beautiful options to choose from. Don’t be shy, you will not be the only one donning the kimono in the street. If you want, you can even get a full Geisha makeover!Thrift Shopping: There are so many awesome thrift shops in Japan! The quality is great, too. If you are looking for unique clothes, cool vintage items, or old books and CDs, head to areas like Shimokitazawa and Harajuku in Tokyo, American Village in Osaka, or simply keep a lookout for pop up stalls and markets the locals often hold - just ask your hostel!Try the Local Delicacies: If you have an adventurous food palette, horse meat sushi, Puffer Fish sashimi, natto (fermented beans often eaten with a raw egg) are just some of the stranger things you can try in Japan.

Both options cost less than $10 per night in all of the major destinations. Camping is also available. Another accommodation option that’s not only fun and cheap, but also helps travelers put the money to the hands of the locals, is to engage with the Community Based Tourism Association to make homestay arrangements for about $10 per night. Staying with a local family is also a great way to immerse yourself in the local culture, and the home-cooked food is just a plus.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($15 & up): Hotels can be found in the tourist areas like Bishkek, Osh, and Karakol. A budget hotel costs about $15 per night, whereas a mid range hotel with better amenities and facilities costs about $30 - $35 per night. Airbnb has made its way to the country, with a private room averaging about $10, and an entire unit at about $25.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Bishkek International Airport, and Osh International Airport. Direct international flights are available from China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Moscow and Turkey. Crossing borders overland is available twice a week by train from Moscow, whereas driving is possible from China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, though borders could close without prior notice, and the journey could take a long time.Getting Around: Local transportation, with some unique to the country, would be the main way to get around in Kyrgyzstan. Minivans called Marshrutka are available in major cities, and they cover most routes. While they are not the most comfortable mode of transportation, ticket price is standardized at less than $0.20, regardless of the distance. For intercity travels, the ticket price is standardized at about $4, again, regardless of the distance. Trains cover fairly limited routes, and for those short on time, taking a shared taxi would be the best. In the mountains, you can ride on horseback, though I trekked through the mountains on foot and would definitely prefer it that way.FoodHearty Homecooked Meals ($3 - $5): If you are anywhere outside of the major cities, restaurants can be hard to come by, but your hostel or homestay hosts would very likely provide food, and the dishes are typically hearty Kyrgyzstan food. Expect mutton with lots of fat, rice, and noodles on the table. If you are trekking through the mountains and staying in yurts, your guides will also cook for you. The food is delicious in Kyrgyzstan! Restaurants ($5 - $10): In major cities like Bishkek, you will find a variety of local and international restaurants. Turkish, Chinese, Indian, and Italian food are pretty decent and even authentic. Tea is very popular, but if you are looking for something a dose stronger, vodka is also widely available. Tipping is increasingly customary - expect to tip at about 10%.Things to DoTrek the Tian Shan Mountains: I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that a place like this actually exists. There are different routes you can discuss with your guide and choose from, but personally, I started off remote, then made my way to the beautiful lakes, and back out through a national park. A few things to know before trekking Kyrgyzstan is that it is definitely challenging, I had to bend my foot at a 45 degree angle to match the slope for hours, and there were barely any trails or anyone else in sight for some of it. It was one of the tougher treks I’ve done but also one of the most rewarding.Experience Yurt Life on Lake Issyk-Kul: In many ways, Kyrgyzstan reminds me of Patagonia, but one distinctive difference is that you can only experience the yurt life in Central Asia. To do that, head to Lake Issyk-Kul, or include that as part of your trekking itinerary. The yurt camps scattered around the lake are mostly family-run places. Expect fantastic food (mostly meat and heavy on the dill, which I love), and even more fantastic hospitality. You could also swim in the lake if weather allows. Explore Ala-Archa: The Ala Archa National Park is a few hours away from Bishkek, with many day trips available to those who want to hike, rock climb, or ski while being surrounded by the natural beauty. The Ala-Archa Canyon is stunning, there are also waterfalls, a pine forest and gorgeous mountain peaks.  Recommended Products"

Don’t be shy and say hello to them. However, nonviolent theft is common, especially in Phnom Penh. Keep belongings close and hidden, particularly in tuk tuksClimate: Hot and humid year-round. Rainy season lasts from May to OctoberBest SIM card: Smart or Metfone - prepaid SIM card best purchased directly at store locations, available in most major cities (ask for locations at your guesthouse and bring your passport)Modesty Considerations: Display of bare skin is generally frowned upon. It is polite, and sometimes required to cover your shoulders and knees when at temples such as Angkor WatRandom useful tip: When buying smaller items such as a snack, ask if you can pay in local currency (Cambodian Riel), as it could sometimes be cheaper than paying in US DollarAccommodationLow budget solo travelers ($3 - $5): Budget travelers rejoice, as accommodation will be the cheapest part of Cambodia if you work it right - just accept that you most likely won’t have air conditioning or hot water, though free Wi-Fi and breakfast are provided by most hostels. Read my hostel recommendations across Cambodia here.Mid budget solo travelers ($5 - $15): Private rooms are affordable, sometime even cheaper than staying in dorms if you can find someone to share a room and split the cost. On the islands, you can get a simple chalet that’s right on the beach with about $15. Airbnb is rapidly gaining its popularity in major cities. More and more luxurious, huge hotel chains are on the rise, too – From poolside villa to hotels with in-house casino, Cambodia is ready if you are ready to splurge.FoodLocal & Street food ($1 - $5): At the local food markets which usually open both day and night, you can easily fill your tummy up with a big glass of mix fruit juice or draft beer and a plate of delicious fried rice with BBQ pork for less than $3. Go where the locals go, which normally are tiny food stalls by the roadside – it’s always fun to squat on tiny chairs and amuse locals with your excellent chopstick skills. Go on an adventurous street food hunt which is not only fun but also cheap, though the catch is that you might not really know what you are eating…Restaurants and Cafes ($5 - $15): Air-conditioned restaurants that serve Western cuisine costs about $5 - $15 for a complete meal. It is also easy to find quirky little cafes by the riverside serving baguette and good coffee, thanks to its French colonial history.Unique Food to try: Fried insects are popular snacks in Cambodia. They are usually spotted at street markets or in a big basket on top of the seller’s head on long distance buses and trains. Balut is a local delicacy I could not bring myself to try but if you are feeling really adventurous, keep a lookout for it on the street.TransportationGetting There: Most travelers land on the two major international airports, Phnom Penh International Airport, and Siam Reap Airport. There aren’t any direct flights from the United States, Europe, Australasia, and South Africa, so you are very likely to stop over at one of the major airports outside of Cambodia first. Crossing the borders overland can be done from Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos, usually through buses or private cars. Make sure to check the Visa requirements for each border.Getting Around Town: Tuk-tuks are everywhere – literally. Make sure to negotiate and confirm the price before you get on one. You can also easily rent a motorbike or bicycle from shops and hostels. I recommend doing this especially when visiting the magnificent Angkor Wat – a tuk tuk costs $20 for a day, a push-bike $5. Make sure to check the vehicle’s condition and take pictures of any existing damages because while the rental and fuel is cheap, repair costs could make you drop your jaw. For solo travelers who can’t ride a bike, there is an option of moto taxis.Inter-city Traveling: Buses are surprisingly efficient and comfortable. They depart frequently from Siam Reap – Phnom Penh – Kampot – Sihanoukville and more, costing about $2 per hour. Giant Ibis is the expats’ favorite long distance bus company. Buses depart on time, snacks and botted water are given out on all trips, and the drivers seem to know what they are doing. If you want to rough it out, minivans are a even cheaper option though expect to squeeze with 20 other people in a 15-person van. Hitch-hiking is not common but definitely possible.Things to DoVisit Angkor Wat: The largest religious monument in the world is probably the #1 reason why you are visiting Cambodia. Prior to my visit, I looked it up online and knew it was massive, and thought I was prepared, but still I was blown away. It. Is. Huuuge. Get the 3-day pass which costs $64 (as of 2017) and plan your routes properly. $64 is a lot of money but the price will only go higher, and you can’t leave Cambodia without seeing this temple complex with your own eyes, can you? To save money on other things, rent a bike instead of hiring a tuk-tuk driver, and consider packing some food with you as restaurants in that area charge a lot higher, sometimes twice as much as restaurants in other areas.Hit Pub Street: A great place to relax and rewind after a full day of exploring Angkor Wat. Think $1 draft beer, $2 manicure / pedicure, $2 massage, $2 fish spa, $1 fried noodles, $1 fruit shake, plus fun night clubs and pubs for those who want to dance the night away.Live the Island Life: Beaches in Cambodia are slightly less crowded than its neighbors, though I am sure that they will not stay that way for any longer. Kep is a quiet beach town, Koh Rong a diving paradise, Rabbit Island secluded and serene, Sihanoukville great for partying, Otres Beach a special place in my heart.. just pick one, or all of them, before they turn too touristic.Visit The Killing Fields & Prison S21: The country’s dark, bloody genocidal past is clearly illustrated in these haunting places. You probably won’t be able to skip your way out after looking at the photos, graves, and the massive skull tower, but it is a memorable and impactful experience not to be missed. I recommend spending the morning at The Killing Fields, before it gets too hot, and make your way to the Prison 21 in the afternoon.Sail through a river village: Observe a life that’s essentially built on water, with houses built on bamboo stilts, vendors selling food and drinks on wooden boats, and kids swimming and playing in the river. It has become a bit of a tourist trap but still worth a visit.Chill at Kampot: Kampot is laid back and quiet, surrounded by Bokor Mountains. It is the perfect place to do absolutely nothing.Cycle around in Kratie: …and feel like a celebrity while kids chase after you yelling “Hello!” 20 times! It is a simple and beautiful countryside filled with gorgeous rice field and cows.Apps to downloadLebOOst Cambodia (local guides to all the cool spots in Phnom Penh), Phum Dictionary (accurate translations from English to Khmer).

Also, the structure of most overnight buses will have you spooning your neighbor over the bumpiest roads in all of Southeast Asia.Climate: Hot and humid year-round. Rainy season lasts from May to OctoberBest SIM cards: ETL and Unitel – cards can be purchased at the airport and major convenience storesModesty Consideration: Displaying of bare skin is generally frowned upon, and you are required to cover your shoulders and knees when visiting the temples. Dress modestly and bring a scarf or sarong with youRandom useful tip: Curfew in Laos is 11pm, but in some cities like Luang Prabang, the bowling alley is curiously open all nightAccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($3 - $6): If staying in dorms or sharing a room, it is pretty easy to get by spending around $3 - $6 in most places. Bigger cities tend to cost much more than smaller towns. The cost of accommodation changes with the season, too. You can get an entire bungalow by the river in Nong Khiaw, a small village 4 hours away from Luang Prabang, for as low as $3 during low season. Most hostels these days offer free Wi-Fi, but powercuts are very common in Laos, so if you need the Internet all the time, you are better off with a local SIM card with data.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($5 - $15): Many hostels in Laos also operate budget hotels with basic private rooms. Expect to pay around $5 for a basic fan room, whereas a private room with AC costs around $8 - $15. Airbnb is rapidly gaining its popularity in major cities, with a private room costing about $8.FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 - $3): Due to a lack of large scale farming, food in Laos is more expensive than its neighbors. That said, you can still find cheap and delicious street food for about $1 per dish. In the night markets at Luang Prabang, there are buffet-style stalls where you can fill your bowl with as much food as you want for $2. Follow the locals to the hole-in-the-wall restaurants that serve tasty baguettes all day.Cafes & Restaurants ($5 - $10): Major cities are dotted with mid-range restaurants and cafes that serve Western, Indian and French cuisine, costing about $5 - $10 per dish. International fast food and café chains are also growing rapidly in Laos. You will find lovely cafes serving coffee and cakes in most main streets. While there aren’t many clubs or pubs in Laos and things quiet down after 11pm, most restaurants serve alcohol, with a bottle of beer costing about $1 - $3.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Luang Prabang International Airport and Wattay International Airport, However, there are no direct flights to Laos from countries outside of Asia, and most travelers would cross borders overland from its neighboring countries as part of their big trip in Southeast Asia. Land borders are uncomplicated to cross, with the options including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China.Getting Around Town: I did not see any metered taxis during my time in Laos. However, Tuk-tuks and moto taxis are widely available – make sure to always negotiate and confirm the price before getting on one. Renting a bike is easy and as long as you are confident enough on two wheels, riding through the mountains is not only fun but also meditating. Just watch out for the cows.Inter-city Traveling: This is the part where things can get a little bit frustrating. Laos is a mountainous country with poor roads, so getting from point A to point B could take a long time, even if the distance seems short, KM-wise. Local buses / minivans are cheaper but take a notoriously long time due to frequent and long stops, while night-time VIP busses can cost upwards of USD$20.  Book directly at the bus depot to save a few dollars. It sounds horrible, and truthfully it kind of is, but if you can look at the situation with a pinch of salt, it could end up in good fun and you might make new local friends on the road.Things to DoTubing in Vang Vieng: There were rumors going around stating that tubing is Vang Vieng was over, due to the high numbers of backpackers who overdosed, crashed, and sadly died while tubing down the river. Well, the party was and is still well and alive today! Be smart and drink responsibly and you will have a fabulous time tubing down the river, making stops along the way to dance and make new friends.Float Down the Mekong River: When in the 4000 islands, chat up with your dorm mates and organize a day trip tubing down the Mekong River. It’s a more laid back experience compared to the one in Vang Vieng. It was one of my favorite Laos memories. You could also rent a kayak if that’s up your valley.Swimming in the Kuang Si Waterfalls: While it is the most popular waterfalls in Laos, it is, for some reasons, never really overly crowded – the place is huge and there are many parts that make up the entire waterfalls, giving space to everyone who visits. Do not stop at the main pool, take a small trek up and look for the (not so) secret pool for a cool swim in the blue water. The rescued bears close to the entrance are absolutely adorable to look at, too.Zip Lining at the Gibbon Experience: I did not try this but it definitely sounds like an experience of a lifetime! Here, some of the world’s highest treehouses are connected by ziplines and you get to spend a few nights ziplining across them, trekking, and hanging out with the gibbons.Trekking Bolaven Plateau: In all honesty, I’d take the waterfalls at Bolaven Plateau over Kuang Si Waterfalls any day. Located at Southern Laos close to Pakse, It is what I imagined wild, untouched Southeast Asia might look like. Trek around that area and be blown away by the greenery and current that Bolaven Plateau has to offer.Relax in Nong Khiaw: About 5 hours away from Luang Prabang is Nong Khiaw, a quiet, laidback village that’s perfect for relaxing. In low season, a spacious bungalow next to the river could cost as low as $3. There’s honestly not much to do other than trekking and swimming in the river (which is perfect!). You can also take a 3-4 hour walk to one of the 3 smaller villages close by and spend a night at a local homestay, experiencing the true Laotian village life.Get a Tiger Balm massage: …or 3, in my case. It is amazing, feels great, and will leave your skin tingling.  Lao massages are AWESOME. Recommended Products"

People are incredibly kind and friendly, I felt at home during both of my visits in 2013 and 2016. That said, pickpockets and snatch thieves are common in tourist areas so keep a close eye on your belongings.Climate: Hot and humid year-round. The rainy season in the southwest lasts from May to September and in the northeast from October to JanuaryBest SIM cards: Dialog - cards can be purchased at the airport for cheapModesty Considerations: Shoulders and knees should be covered especially when visiting the temples. Tattoos of Buddha are highly offensive so if you happen to have one, try not to have it exposed. Bikinis are allowed on the beach but cover up or at least wear a shawl when you enter a restaurant or the streetsRandom useful tip: The language you use and best time of year to go depends on which part of the country you want to visit. If you want to see it all, aim for a shoulder season (September - November)AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($5 - $10): The first time I was in Nepal in 2013, finding a dorm was a challenge. Things have definitely changed since then, with affordable hostels on the rise especially in the popular areas like Galle. They are usually very basic but a clean bed with mosquito net and a working fan are sometimes all you need to have a good night’s rest. On the beach, expect to pay around the same price range for a basic hut close to the water.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($15 - $30): Expect to pay around $15 - $20 for a basic private room with air-conditioning. Guesthouses that are usually family-run and cost around $20 - $30 and usually come with good home-cooked food. Airbnbs are increasingly popular, with a private room starting at $10, and an entire unit starting at $30. Other Accommodation Options: In Dambulla, I was able to experience a unique hotel that resembles a jungle domicile with cave drawings on the outside, a little house in front done in the traditional style with hand prints and chalk drawings, and that made me felt like I was transported to Sri Lanka’s past. It costs around $100, but can easily be shared by two or even three people.FoodLocal Food ($1 - $5): Sri Lankan food is delicious, cheap, and somewhat similar to Indian cuisine. Expect to find rice and curry as the staples, fruit and vegetables filled up most of your plates, and tons of spices thrown in the pots. Remember to tell the chef your spiciness endurance level! While tourists are usually provided with cutlery, I highly recommend taking the when in Rome approach – the locals boast that eating with fingers (right hand only) make the food taste even better. Breakfast can cost as low as $1 - $2; lunch and dinner cost about $3 - $5.Restaurant ($5 - $8): The locals rarely eat at restaurants, so most sit-down restaurants cater only to tourists. This means that the menu may be adjusted slightly. They are altogether not that common in Sri Lanka, so you are most likely to find restaurants within your hostels or guesthouses. If you hire a driver for a day, you may be taken to restaurants that run about $20 so advise him/her that you want the local experience. Choices are fairly limited to what you can find from food stalls and markets, only with better quality ingredients and hygiene than some local restaurants where the food sits out for much of the day. Beer runs about $3 for a bottle.TransportationGetting There: Sri Lanka has 2 official airports: Bandaranaike International Airport, north of Colombo, and Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. The former is more popular and you are more likely to land on the former. Many budget airlines fly to Sri Lanka on a daily basis.Getting Around Town: Motor taxis are widely available in most parts of the country. Hiring a car and driver for the day costs about $20 - $50, and the ones that I’ve encountered were fun and honest. It’s a great way to get around the country if you’re on a time crunch and can split with a few others. Uber is available in major cities, and a ride from the city center to the airport only cost about $5. Bikes are available for hire in most tourist towns and you can easily find one through your hostel or the rental shops. However, fuel in Sri Lanka is expensive and would add to your costs significantly. It may sometime make more sense to take a taxi instead.Inter-city Traveling: Buses are a very cheap option at just a few dollars for a 6-hour ride, though they are typically packed until it’s standing room only. I rarely came across one with air conditioning. Tickets are sold on board and busses leave when full. The trains are also cheap and convenient, with a second-class cabin ran from $1.5 - $4. This is my favorite method of traveling in Sri Lanka! However, these also sometimes run out of seats, meaning you may have to stand or sit on the floor. This may be fine for some but if you want to make sure to get a seat, book first or second class tickets in advance.Things to DoTake the Train: This was my favourite Sri Lanka memory. It may sound crazy but the best seat is the doorway, where you get a front-row view of the tea plantations, waterfalls, running brooks, and misty clouds as the train crawls through them. It is also very cheap, with tickets available at $1 - $4. Taking the train, in my opinion, is less of a traveling method and more of a Sri Lankan experience on its own.Relax at Arugam Bay: Situated on the East Coast of Sri Lanka, Arugam Bay is the perfect little hippie town, full of surfers, backpackers, and locals. Chill at one of the beach bars, spend an entire day reading in a hammock, go surfing, go swimming. Life on the Arugam Bay is simple and beautiful.Stay in a Resort on Passikudah Beach or Trincomalee: For a more luxurious experience, book into one of the beautiful resorts on Passikudah Beach or Trincomalee. Both offer really gorgeous beaches and excellent view underwater. See the Animals of Sri Lanka at Yala National Park: It is the most-visited wildlife preserve in Sri Lanka.  Located in the southern part of the country, it’s home to scores of members of the animal kingdom. Every few minutes a new creature flew, bounded, crawled, or ran by. Everything from wild boars, to elephants, to big cats and even bigger lizards make Yala their home.Spend a Day with Wild Elephants: Sri Lanka’s endless jungle that stretches miles and miles in all directions is the perfect sanctuary to the amazing Sri Lankan wild elephants. Go to Minneriya National Park near Dambulla in the cultural triangle, and you could possibly be surrounded by more than 200 wild elephants eating, mating, playing in the water, and generally doing elephant-y things.Visit the UNCESCO sites of Sri Lanka: In Polonnaruwa, you will see Buddha statues and carvings dated back as far as the 13th century. Then there was Sigiriya Rock, one of the most famous cultural icons that can be seen on much of Sri Lanka’s tourism posters and billboards. Rising 200 meters out of the jungle, it was an impressive place to build an ancient kingdom.Watch the Sunrise on Adam’s Peak: Adam’s peak (or Sri Prada) is so-named because it is believed that Adam’s footprint rests at the top, if you ask a Muslim or Christian, that is.  If you ask a Buddhist, it is most certainly the Buddha’s footprint and if you ask a Hindu, it belongs to Shiva. The 50000-stair climb will lead you to one of the most beautiful sunrises Asia has to offer. The hike is a bit of a challenge but trust me when I say it’s well worth it! Recommended Products"

Do not expect WiFi to work well, and be prepared for the occasional electricity shortage.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($15 and up): Most private rooms in Myanmar cost about $15 per night, which can be cheaper than staying in a hostel if you can find someone to share a twin bedroom with. If you are traveling during shoulder or low seasons, it is possible to walk into a guesthouse and bargain a price with the owner. Airbnb is available in major cities, though they tend to be on the pricier side at an average of $40 per night.FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 – $3): To be honest, Burmese food is not nearly as exciting as Thai or Vietnamese food. Staples include rice, noodles, curry, deep fried meat and fermented seafood, with lots of Indian influence. That being said, food can be extremely cheap and filling if you choose to eat where the locals eat, or at the local food markets. With as little as $2, you can get rice with 5 small plates of dishes, plus soup and fruit in a local place.Cafes & Restaurants ($5 – $10): International fast food and restaurant chains have started operating in major cities in the last few years. You will normally find them in shopping malls and city centers. Expect to pay about $5-$10 for a full course meal.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Yangon International Airport and Mandalay International Airport. Direct flights from other Southeast Asian countries can be as low as $40. However, there are no direct flights to Myanmar from countries outside of Asia, so you would need to consider flights to Myanmar via stops in places like Bangkok or Singapore. Entering the country on land is possible but difficult from Thailand, unless you have a special permit from a prestige resort or live-aboard diving company.Getting Around Town: In Yangon, Grab, which is the Southeast Asian equivalent of Uber, is available, though you might be better off hailing down local taxis or tuk tuks by the roadside. Always haggle and agree on a price before getting in. The local buses can be very confusing as there are no fixed stops, but it is a lot of fun if you are happy to explore the local way. In Bagan, unless you hire a private guide, or are on a group tour, you will have to rent an e-bike or a bicycle to get around.Inter-city Traveling: This is the part where things can get a little bit frustrating. Due to bad road conditions, and frequent and long stops, getting from one town to another tends to take longer than expected. If you are taking a local bus or minivan, don’t be surprised to find them stopping at restaurants, factories, and offices to deliver parcels on the way. Many buses are repurposed school buses from Korea and Japan from the late 80s and 90s, so don’t expect a comfortable seat and fully working AC! VIP buses can cost upwards of USD$15. Book directly at the bus depot to save a few dollars. It sounds horrible, and truthfully it kind of is, but if you can look at the situation with a light heart and go with the flow, it could end up in good fun and you might make new local friends on the road.Things to DoShwedagon Pagoda in Yangon: The iconic golden pagoda is the perfect introduction to your Myanmar adventure. Shwedagon Pagoda is an important Buddhist monument that was built sometime within the 6th-10th centuries (legend has it built 2500 years ago!), and renovation as well as expansion is constantly taking place. For a more local experience, try to get there before sunrise. The peaceful atmosphere as devoting locals gather for their morning prayers really adds to the overall experience!Sunrise + sunset in Bagan: Bagan is the stuff of fairytales – except it’s all real and open to explore. You used to be able to climb up on the temples and have a Tomb Raider-like experience, but this is no longer possible. With all temples now closed, you have to get creative hunting down the best sunrise and sunset spots. Don’t worry though, I have done all the homework for you. Have a bit of budget to splurge? Bagan is one of the most incredible places to see from high up Here’s how you can fly over Bagan in a hot air balloon.Pagodas in Mandalay: I personally spent 24 hours in Mandalay, and despite online reviews stating that Mandalay is chaotic and busy, I came out totally loving it. Mandalay is pagoda central, with so many unique pagodas including one that houses the world’s largest book, and one that, frankly, looks like a beautiful wedding cake. Hire a driver for the day and get to exploring!Kakku Pagodas: Near-ish to Inle Lake, the Mwe Taw Kakku Pagoda Complex is the perfect off the beaten path alternative to the usual lake and temple tour. Imagine a corn maze of intricately decorated stupas, varying in color from white to gold, pink, and orange, all arranged in such a way that you can weave through them, getting gloriously lost in a twinkling, bell-sounding forest of Buddhist devotion. Sounds pretty dreamy, am I right?Ngapali Beach: I’m always on the hunt for the beautiful places in Southeast Asia that aren’t overrun yet, and this crescent-shaped beach above Ngapali is straddling the line, at least for now. The slightly cold water is perfect for cooling off. It is also a beautiful spot for sunset. If you are looking for a peaceful and laidback coastal town experience, Ngapali is the perfect place to be.  Recommended Products"
https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Maldives-guide/,Maldives guide,Maldives," The Maldives is a dream destination for many. With all of those islands with little huts on top over crystal clear water and white sand, who doesn't dream of visiting this idyllic island paradise?I used to think that it was prohibitively expensive to visit the Maldives, and that it was likely out of my reach. Then I took a chance on a cheap flight out and realized that between affordable resorts and locally-owned guesthouses, it's completely possible to have a Maldives vacation that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. With amazing underwater life and over 1,000 islands to choose from, there's tons to do in the Maldives for those who love to be in the water. It can also be a unique cultural experience if you want a vacation that's a little different than what your friends are doing. These guides are here to show you that the Maldives can be within reach.   The Maldives is a dream destination for many.

The locals are friendly and I loved having the chance to get to know them on the local islandsClimate: Warm and humid year-round. Monsoon season runs from May to October, peaking in JuneBest SIM cards: Dhiragoo which you can buy at arrivals at the airportModesty Considerations: On the resort islands, there are no dress code restrictions. However, bikinis, pork, alcohol are not allowed on the local islandsRandom useful tip: If you want to be around Maldivian people, you're unlikely to meet many at a resort, where the staff is typically foreign. This is because the locals are not allowed to serve alcohol and most resort islands sell it. Since the Maldives is a Muslim country, it's also not possible to wear bikinis on the local islands. Surprise! AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($20 - $50): First of all, yes, it is possible to do Maldives on a budget. Since Maldives opened up the possibility of tourism on locally inhabited islands in 2009, guesthouses and budget hotels mushroomed and you can now get a budget private room on the local island for about $20-$50 per night. The best place to book a room is through Airbnb or Agoda. I stayed in an amazing BnB called The Amazing Noovilu at $100 per night. My travel buddy and I shared a room big enough to accommodate a small family, and our host and his family cooked 3 meals per day for us. We also went on snorkeling and diving trips that felt like exclusive private tours. The bottom line is that in order to visit the Maldives on a budget, your best bet is on the local islands. Mid-Range Budget Travelers ($70 and up): The second time I visited Maldives, I stayed at an affordable Maldives resort called The Cinnamon Ellaidhoo, that was all-inclusive of food, drinks, and most importantly, diving. During off season, the rooms are available at discounted rates. There are also many other affordable, mid-range hotels and resorts available on the island. My advice is to look for a place that provides food, drinks and diving so you can save money on them. Keep in mind, on resort islands, you’ll most likely be surrounded by couples. FoodWhile most accommodation options take care of your meals, there are local markets on Male, the main island, and some small local restaurants on the local islands that serve local and Sri Lankan food. Items on the menu are fairly limited to seafood and fruit. If you are staying at a resort, you will very likely be served a continental breakfast, and have feasts of fresh seafood or curry for lunch and dinner. Alcohol is expensive unless you’re at an all-inclusive, and only available on the resort islands. TransportationSimilar to your meals, your resort would take care of getting you around. If you are staying on the local islands, you can go on snorkeling trip that costs about $30, and ferries between islands are fairly cheap, starting at about $5 for a single trip.The only international airport on the Maldives is Male Ibrahim Nasir Airport. Some hotels offer a transfer service, while others may not. You can get a ferry from the airport to Malé itself which is a few dollars and leaves when full.  From there, take a taxi to the ferry station that services the rest of the islands.  Be forewarned that not every day offers a local ferry (which ran at about $20 for Mahibadoo).  Check the ferry schedule when considering your flight bookings.Things to DoDiving: Diving in Maldives is amazing! I remember seeing a reef shark within a few minutes in the water. On the same day, some divers I met told me they saw a whale shark - you can easily spot some seriously impressive underwater creatures here. Diving is possible all year but visibility may be slightly poorer during the rainy season between May – November. Try to find a resort that allows you to take scuba gear out anytime you want so you can squeeze in as many dives as possible. Snorkeling & Other Activities: Snorkeling is just as amazing as diving in Maldives. I went on manta and whale shark watching tours and was not disappointed. The Maldives also offers all kinds of activities on the water, such as surfing, water skiing, paragliding, and so on. Just make sure to slather on sunscreen!Stay at a Local Guesthouse: Even if you have enough budget for a resort, I’d still suggest experiencing staying with a local guesthouse for a few nights if possible. This is mainly because it is difficult to meet Maldivian people on the resort islands, as they are not allowed to serve alcohol. The locals are kind and friendly, and staying with them normally comes with great conversations, awesome home cooked food and a real sense of how Maldivians eat, live, and love life.Visit the National Museum: Go beyond the beach and visit the 3 storey national museum in Male that preserves the Maldivian history and culture. Admission is about $6.5. Recommended Products"

The U.S government has issued a level 4 (do not travel) warning for areas including Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas due to crime and kidnapping. That being said, the places I have visited, most of which are frequented by international visitors, felt safe. Just be mindful, learn some basic spanish and you are good to go.Solo Travel Friendliness: Don’t let the media put you off – so many solo female travelers rave about Mexico as one of the best solo destinations! Each town seems to have endless things to do, street food makes eating alone less awkward, and people are generally kind and friendly. It might be a good idea to not disclose that you are traveling solo to avoid potentially sticky situations, though.Climate: Dry season starts from December-April, wet season starts in May-October. Go in January-February if you are hoping to see the passing whales.Best SIM cards: Telcel – cards can be purchased at the airport and major shopping malls. Bring your passport.Random Useful Tip:AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($6-$17): Expect to pay about $7-$17 per night in Mexico City, $6-$12 per night in Cancun, $8-$15 per night in Tulum, and $8-$15 per night in Playa del Carmen, for a dorm bed. Most hostels come with free breakfast and WiFi.Mid-Range Solo Travelers ($16 and up): A night at a decent, 3-star hotel costs from $16 in Mexico City, from $18 in Cancun, from $32 in Tulum, and from $16 in Playa del Carmen. Airbnbs are amazing and popular in most places, and an entire place could be significantly cheaper than hotels if you are splitting the cost with someone. If you are looking for a comfortable stay and are happy to splurge a little for more privacy, I loved my one-bedroom airbnb in San Francisco.FoodStreet Food ($2 – $10): Mexican street food is my favorite. Tacos, tamales, enchiladas, tostadas, more tacos… oh boy! Stick to the little, unassuming local eateries that are more authentic, tastier, and cheaper. A fresh and hot taco costs as little as $0.50! If you’re hesitant about the whole affair, go to a stand that has lots of patrons. It wouldn’t be super popular if it made people sick. For a fuller meal, look for fondas, or fonditas, where a full course meal is served at just about $2-$5. If you want fresh fruits, keep a lookout for the local fruiterias. Chances are all of the produce is fresh from local farms.Local Restaurants ($15 – $30): It’s hard to beat Mexican food, even when comparing it to the rest of the world, at least in my Southern Californian heart. Get ready to make your tummy very, very happy! A meal at the local restaurant costs about $5-$10. On coastal towns, expect to pay more at the beachfront restaurants. TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Mexico International Airport (MEX) and Cancun International Airport (CUN), though there are more than 70 international airports across the country. Direct flights are available from just about every major city in the USA. If you prefer land transport, the Amtrak train rides are available from major cities in the USA and Canada. Driving into Mexico can honestly be quite painful at the border, and your local auto insurance most likely does not cover Mexico, so a Mexican policy is required.Getting Around town: If you are in the major cities, the public bus system (known as camiones) is affordable and convenient. You could easily get around on about $0.50 per ride. Outside of the major cities, or on the islands, you may consider renting a car. When driving in Mexico, go slow, drive defensively, and watch for speed bumps in the towns. Car rentals are dirt cheap, just make sure that insurance is included in your booking or they’ll try to charge you extra for it when you pick up the car. Inter-city Traveling: You can take long distance buses to get from one city to another. Look for a directo your journey has lesser stops along the way. Domestic flights may make more logistic sense. They are affordable and frequent.Things to DoCenote hopping in Tulum: Tulum is a dreamy, laid back beach paradise with white sands and jungle adventures. It’s one of those places that make you plan your next visit as soon as you arrived. There are so many cenotes scattered just about everywhere that you could spend weeks only going cenote hunting. Each has a unique selling point as well – some are best for diving, others are deep in caves, and they vary in color as well. Of course, that’s not the only activity available – you can explore the jungle, get in the water, eat delicious local food.Relax in San Francisco: This is the perfect place to relax. Nowhere to be, no schedule to maintain, no alarm to set. It’s not a place with a list of things to do, in fact there’s really nothing much to do. There are no high-rise hotels nor dazzling lights. The cell signal barely works, even in town, although there are adorable shops and delicious restaurants to keep you busy. If that sounds perfect to you, you know where to head to!Join a retreat in Sayulita: In many ways, Camille Willemain’s Medicine Women retreat was life-changing. If you are interested in joining a women’s retreat that also includes local beliefs and traditions, this retreat is perfect for you.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/Malaysia-guide/,Malaysia guide,Malaysia,"Malaysia, marred by plane crashes of its major airlines as of late, is otherwise known for a few things: great food, a mix of many cultures, and truly stunning beaches. The Malay, Chinese, and Indian influences have all converged in places like Georgetown in Panang and Kuala Lumpur to make both cities a foodie's paradise. Malaysia is a more economically prosperous country than most of its Southeast Asian peers and the colonial past left by England means that most of the population speaks English pretty well.I spent six weeks traveling through Malaysia, one month in Peninsular and two weeks in Borneo, and fell in love with the culture and the scenery. The scuba diving, particularly in Sipadan, is tied with Komodo in Indonesia for my top diving spot in the world (and that's coming from a girl who has done over 100 dives, including in the Maldives and Belize). When I first arrived, a few people told me it wasn't worth staying long. However, I ended up meeting lots of locals, more able to communicate and find more common ground with them than I had in Cambodia or Laos, and really fell in love with the scenery of the tea growing areas of Cameron Highlands, the jungles of Borneo, and the gorgeous blue water. It's worth exploring this country beyond just Kuala Lumpur, especially if you love diving or want to give it a try.

Just keep a close eye on your belongings.Climate: Hot and humid year-round. Rainy season lasts from November to March.Best SIM cards: Hotlink - cards can be purchased at the airport and at major convenience storesModesty Considerations: The majority of the Malaysian society remains modest and conservative, though allowances are usually made for foreigners, especially in the urbanized cities. Bring a scarf or sarong when visiting places that require covering up.Random useful tip: When interacting with the elderly, Malaysians tend to address them as “uncle” and “auntie”- everyone is family!AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($7 - $10): It is fairly easy to find decent hostels at a reasonable price range in Malaysia. Many hostels offer free Wi-Fi and simple breakfast (toast & tea/coffee) and are generally well located.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($15 - $20): Feeling fancy but still want to keep your budget for accommodation in check? Top up a little and you will find yourself in a private room at a hostel (privacy + social!) or a simple chalet by the beach. A 3-star hotel room typically costs $25 - $40, Airbnbs run from $10 for a shared room to $50 for a private unit. Aside from Airbnbs, you can also camp at nature parks and public lands.FoodLocal food spots ($2 - $5): For breakfast, pick any hawker center that’s packed with locals and do it the local way, which means a pack of Nasi Lemak (coconut rice), a plate of roti canai or a bowl of Wan Tan Noodles. For lunch, visit a mamak (ask the locals where to go, they usually have a favorite!) and order yourself a naan and Teh Tarik (pulled tea), relax and observe how the locals interact with each other by mixing their languages – a fascinating byproduct of multiracialism. As for dinner, ask your hostel where the nearest night markets are and make sure to check them out. Think freshly made Char Kuey Teow (fried rice noodles), tropical fruits, unique snacks and bubble milk tea for less than $2.Restaurants ($5 - $10): All of the major cities in Malaysia have dynamic restaurant scenes, serving local and international cuisine. A meal in a typical local restaurant costs $5, whereas Western cuisines could cost much more. Fast food chains are present just about everywhere, with a set meal costing $3 - $5. Alcohol is expensive and could jerk up your bill so be mindful! Another thing to note is that tipping is not expected as most restaurants will automatically include a service charge in your bill.TransportationGetting Around Town: Particularly in the Peninsular, buses and trains are reliable and cheap, with a single-trip fare costing no more than $1. On the other hand, the taxi drivers in Malaysia are notorious for not using the meter and overcharging tourists, so your best bet would be Uber and Grab, or simply insisting on the meter and only taking a taxi with a driver who agrees to use it. In Sabah and Sarawak, negotiate your way through with taxi drivers, or try hitch-hiking, which could be difficult but not impossible.Inter-city Travel: Your options include buses, trains, private taxis, ferries and domestic flights. Long distance buses and trains are comfortable with frequent departures across the country. Rest stops with restrooms and food kiosks are aplenty along most highways and buses tend to make a stop every 4-5 hours. Most inter-city trains even have a bistro that sell simple snacks and drinks on board. Expect to pay $8 - $15 to get from one city to the other using buses and trains. Private taxis could be expensive for solo travelers, but they are a great option for people traveling in groups. If you are short on time, domestic flights could be a great option and they are sometimes as cheap as other transportation options!Things To DoCity-Hopping: If you are flying in, your first stop in Malaysia is very likely its captial, Kuala Lumpur. Make sure to drop by the iconic Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur and walk across the connecting bridge. Check out the incredible Batu Caves and climb 272 steps to the top and join the tour at the Bat Cave. Visit the National Mosque of Malaysia – even if you are not interested in learning about the country’s main religion, the architecture alone will leave you in awe. Travel up north to Penang and hunt down the infamous street arts curated by Lithuanian artist, Ernest Zacharevic, and visit the mansions (Blue Mansion, Macalister Mansion, Peranakan Mansion), some of which will allow you to spend the night as a guest. Another option is to travel down south to Melaka, a UNESCO World Heritage site with heavy colonial influence. Visit the museums, temples and buildings, and eat your heart out at Jonker street.Swim with Fishes and Turtles, and more: This tropical country is low key a diving paradise – one of the world’s best diving sites, Sipadan Island, calls Malaysia home. Other diving site options include Tioman Island, Perhentian Island, Kapas Island, Redang Island and Langkawi. Even if you do not dive, the gorgeous beaches offer blue water and white sand and frankly, what more can you ask for? Do take note that Sipadan limits daily divers and requires a permit to dive, so book at least two weeks in advance.National Parks: There are more than 30 national parks in Malaysia – spoilt for choice is an understatement. Climb Mount Kinabalu National Park, the country’s tallest mountain; explore Taman Negara National Park, the country’s oldest and biggest rainforest; trek through Gunung Gading National Park, home to the world’s biggest (and unfortunately, stinkiest) flower, Rafflesia Flower. Bonus? Most of the national parks are habitated by orangutans, rhinos, monitor lizards and if you are in luck to see, tigers.Get High: Not that way, but both Cameron Highlands and Genting Highlands are worth a visit. The former is a picturesque tea plantation and the latter a casino and theme park wonderland. Even if you are not a fan of what both highlands offer, the cooler temperatures (60°F - 77°F) should be good enough to lure you in.Apps to downloadUpocket (for coupons and discounts), AskMe (an app that allows you to ask locals questions!)

Otherwise, go in a pair and you'll find that locals are helpful and friendlyAccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($3 - $10): If you are on a shoestring budget, camping is possible as there are quite a number of campsites across Mozambique. Expect to pay $3 - $5 for a spot at campsites with basic amenities. Couchsurfing is almost non-existent, while dorms are available at $8 - $10, depending on condition and season. I personally stayed and would recommend Fatima’s Nest.Mid Budget Travelers ($15 and up): On Tofo Beach and Vilanculos, I found beach front bungalows with working electricity (the power in Mozambique goes on and off sometimes) for less than $20. There are decent lodges and budget hotels that cost about $30 - $40 for a private double room. Airbnbs average at about $50 for a private room, and about $120 for an entire unit.FoodLocal Eats ($1 - $5): Food is unbelievably cheap and delicious in Mozambique. Seafood is almost always available and fresh. Expect to pay $6 for a a big plate of fresh Barracuda. Fruit is incredible and fresh – especially mango and coconut, which are cheap at markets but not bad if you haggle with the beach boys either, who will try to sell it to you daily. The country is also famous for prawns and lobster with piri-piri sauce so make sure to try that out if you like it hot!Restaurants and Bars ($5 and up): Many hotels and lodges have on-site restaurants that serve authentic African cuisine with strong Portugese influence. Seafood is a specialty so spoil yourself with a huge seafood platter and wash it down with a glass of beer – expect to pay about $10 for that. Tipping is only expected in Maputo and other major tourist areas.TransportationGetting There: To get to Mozambique from abroad you will probably have to route through Johannesburg or another close airport. In some cases the flight onwards to Tofo or Maputo is prohibitively expensive, but luckily the buses to Maputo from Joburg are decent. Expect to travel for about 10 hours from Joburg to Maputo and an additional 10 or so from Maputo to Tofo on the chapas.Getting Around: There are mainly 3 options – chapas, car rental, and hitchhiking. Unfortunately, none are ideal. Chapas, or minibus taxis, are cheap, though you’ll overpay as a foriegner. They are usually set to depart at 4am and will drive around for several hours finding people to pick up before they leave. They’re a slow and often unsafe options. Car rentals from South Africa are another option, though you will have to make sure to have the right documentation that allows you to drive across the border. Expect to be pulled over by the police for some bribes as well. Keep in mind that bags should be on the floor or in the trunk and not to rest your arm outside the window – two typical reasons why people get pulled over. Hitchhiking is relatively easy but it would be helpful to speak Portugese. Generally, make sure to go in pairs.Things To DoDive in Tofo: The water in Tofo is perfect for goldilocks type – not too warm and not too cold. There are a few diving schools, and the spot itself is famous for the big stuff, like manta rays and whale sharks. Surfing is also big in Tofo. It’s not easy to get there, and the electrcity goes on and off sometimes, but if you are looking for an undisturbed paradise, Look no further than Tofo.Hire A Captain and Sail: Boat trips are a fun and cheap way to fill an afternoon in Mozambique. In Tofo, you can usually organize one with a local or through your hostel with a group of friends for around $30 USD per person. It’s as easy as just asking the question. Chances are good that someone will know someone who has a boat who can take you. It’s the way Tofo works. The boats are simple, with sideways sails and rudders made out of old wood. It won’t be fancy, but it will be beautiful. Bring your own beer, sit back, and enjoy.Make Local Friends: Mozambicans are friendly. Those who can speak English are almost always interested in hanging out with foreigners, and sometimes you can enjoy a heartwarming experience as a result. So don’t be too shy to start a conversation and see where it leads you! I personally met Orlando and Nate, a Mozambican-American duo who bonded and ended up traveling the country together. It was humbling learning their stories!Quad-Bike Through the Sand Dunes: Rent a quad bike and take it through some of the small villages in the sand dunes behind the beach – we are talking about 5-10 grass huts here. Kids will run out and either wave or decide to be little rascals and try to grab onto the back of the quad bike as you ride by. With a quad bike, you can find all kinds of little enclaves and beaches that aren’t accessible directly, and an adventure off the beaten path is always fun.Relax in Vilanculos: In Vilaculos, you could spend hours and hours watching the fishermen, the kids, the waves, the sand bars as far as the eye could see; you can go diving or snorkelling, and you can stay in a beautiful hut that costs only $19. Vilanculos is the place to truly live, even just for a little while. Vilanculos was my last stop in Mozambique, and as I flew out over the sand bars back to South Africa, I silently promised to find a way back one day. It’s the kind of place that make you pinky promise yourself, like a child again.  Recommended Products"

Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Oshiwambo:In most of Namibia, English will work just fine, but it's nice to know a bit of the most spoken language in the country as well - 'Mwa lele po'/''Mwa uhala po'/'Mwa tokelwa po' (good morning/good afternoon/good evening), and 'Iyaloo'(Thank you!).Currency: Namibian Dollar (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: 90 day tourist visa-free available for many nationalities including US, Canada, and most of Western Europe, visa-on-arrival for dozens of others (click here for more info)Safety Rating: Ranked 60 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.89 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.4)Solo Travel Friendliness: Overall, Namibia is a great place for solo travelers. People are friendly, and the country is one of the cheapest in Africa. However, because of its small population, many areas may feel isolated and out of reach, which is perfect for those who seek an off the beaten path adventure, but not so perfect when you need help.Climate: Hot summers (November through February) though the desert gets cold at night, especially in the winters.Best SIM cards: MTC – Cards can be purchased at the airport, authorized shops, or major gas stations and supermarkets.Random useful tip: It's best not to road trip alone through Namibia. The population is small at only 2.5 million people, and cell coverage doesn't work well outside of the towns. If you have a breakdown, you might not see another car pass by all day, and there are no trees to seek shade under.AccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($10 - $15): If you want to save money on accommodation, camping would be the cheapest option and if you ask me, the most enjoyable too. I mostly camped in Namibia and loved being under those clear starry skies. It costs less than $10 to spend the night at a basic campsite, many of which have pools, or about $30 to camp at some lodges. I recommend checking out the community-run campgrounds so your money goes into the hands of local people. Another option is a dorm bed, which costs about $10 - $15 per night in low season. Hot showers are usually provided at both campsites and dorms.Best hotels for mid budget solo female travelers ($50 and up): Family-run guesthouses are more common than hotels. Expect to pay about $50 - $70 for a simple double room, which often comes with some meals. There are also guestfarms that share the concept as a guesthouse but with the addition of hiking trails or other activities. For a more comfortable night, check into a lodge at the more luxurious end of the market. Expect to pay at least $100 for a double room.TransportationGetting There: The main airport in Namibia is the Hosea Kutako International Airport. There are hardly any direct international flights to Namibia, so you are very likely to layover in Johannesburg International Airport first. If you would like to cross overland, you may do so by car or bus from Botswana, Zambia, and Angola. Additional charges will be imposed on foreign cars.Getting Around: There is no official public bus system in the country. However, local buses are available and they connect the few population centers pretty well. Trains are slow but cheap. With $10, you can easily get from one town to another, though it would make sense to pay the extra $3 - $5 to get better seats as the journeys aren’t exactly comfortable. The best way to get around is by car. Rentals can be expensive as most people opt for SUVs or 4x4s. For any long distance traveling, stock up on water and pack some food with you. Basic knowledge of how to change a tire and fix minor car issues are important on these desolate roads.It is important to note that hitchhiking is banned on certain roads and national parks. However, in the rural areas, without a car, hitchhiking might be the only way to get around.FoodLocal Eats: Eating in Namibia is an adventure of its own. The country is famous for its game meat – expect to find zebra, kudu, oryx, and warthog meat on your plate. Seafood is also widely available, and delicious. Don’t worry if you are not feeling that adventurous, as international dishes are also served at most places, and a wide variety of groceries is available at the local supermarkets.Restaurants & Cake Shops ($15 - $30): Due to the country’s lack of fruit and vegetables, most restaurant menus are heavy on the meat side. Expect to pay about $30 for a 3-course meal at a mid range restaurant. Namibian cuisine typically has a touch of German influence, so you shouldn’t be surprised to see German food being offered at the restaurants. For dessert, look for a konditorei (cake shop) for a slice of chocolate cake. 10% tip is customary at most mid range restaurants. Beer is cheap and good, with a bottle costing about $2.Things to DoVisit Etosha National Park: Etosha National Park is one of the best places in southern Africa for a safari, in my personal opinion. It was incorporated in 1907 and spans 8,600 square miles. You are more likely to spot animals here than other national parks due to its structure in nature - the park is partially a massive salt pan and experiences low rainfall, so visibility is good. Rent a vehicle or camper and camp at Okaukuejo Camp within the park limits.Sandboard in Swakopmund: The beautiful sand dunes aren’t just gorgeous to look at, but they are also fun to sandboard on! It may look steep and scary, especially if you are doing it for the first time, but trust me when I say it is completely doable, and you will only want to repeat it over and over again once you have done it for the first time. If this sounds like a piece of cake to you and you are ready for something even more exciting, then…Skydive in Skwakopmund:This was a beautiful, and even peaceful, experience that I will never forget. The main complaint from most skydivers is the cold that hurts their face as they fall, but you will not have this problem in Swakopmund where it’s warm! That, plus the priceless views of the dunes to the sea as you descend, are the reasons why skydiving in Swakopmund is a must.Check Out the Acacia Trees of Deadvlei: No visit to Sossusvlei, Namibia, would be complete without checking out the famous acacia trees of Deadvlei. These black skeletons have been standing still for more than 900 years, and I loved the way the branches eerily reach towards the sun. But before you go, make sure to watch the sunrise at Dune 45 first – it’s worth the morning call, I promise.Animal Sightings: Try saying the following in one breathe - oryx, brown hyena, jackals, flamingos, springbok, dolphins, whales, penguins, horses, zebra, snakes, hyena, springbok, white mongooses, cheetah, gemsbok. Yes, these are the animals that are waiting for you in Namibia. Go to Namibia for the adventurous activities, natural beauty, and value for your money, but also stay for the animal sightings.

I broke my own rule. Never walk alone at night anywhere, especially in NepalClimate: At higher elevations, always plan for snow and freezing temperatures and in the summer, bank on rain and mud. At lower elevations, plan for heat in the spring and summer monthsBest SIM cards: Ncell and Namaste - Easy to get at just about any phone shopModesty considerations: Women should cover up knees and shoulders to ward off unwanted negative attention. Covering up is required for all temple visits. Speaking of temples, some Hindu temples may be off-limits to non-Hindus so make sure to seek permission before entering oneRandom useful tip: The power is only on for a few hours each day, and the times vary each day. Your guesthouse is likely to have the times posted somewhere, or if you're staying somewhere swanky, may have a generatorAccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($5 - $10): While many locally-run guesthouses have been replaced by big international hotel chains in the past few years, it is still possible to find cheap and good dorms and guesthouses in popular areas like Kathmandu and Pokhara. Outside of the high seasons (November and April), you can bargain and get discounts from most places. Consider bringing your own sleeping bag as the cheapest places may not be as clean as you’d like. If you are trekking the Annapurna Circuit or Everest Base Camp, there are guesthouses along the way that provide basic accommodation to trekkers, and the cost is usually nothing more than $1-5 as they gain their money from selling food at a slightly higher price. Be sure to haggle. Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($10 - $35): Mid-range guesthouses come with private rooms that start at $10. The amenities are basic but the rooms tend to be bigger. Other than that, homestay programs operated by tours that involve turning an entire village into accommodation for travelers is a good way to get immersed in Nepalese culture with comfort. Airbnbs are increasingly popular, with a private room starting at around $20, and an entire unit at around $35.FoodLocal Food ($0.5 - $3): Nepalese food is simple and hearty. There are many local diners, confusingly called “hotels”, that sell staples such as daal bhaat and noodle soups. Keep a lookout for seabuckhorn berries that are usually wrapped in newspaper, they are my absolute favourite! Teahouses usually serve nothing more than snacks and drinks, but they are a good place to hang out and observe the locals’ daily life. Along the Annapurna Circuit, guesthouses double up as restaurants, as mentioned above. Since meat usually has to be carried up, it’s advisable to go vegetarian during the trek. Remember to bring along a way to purify the water too, such as purification tablets or a filter. Restaurants ($3 - $8): Sit-down restaurants typically integrate local cuisine with tourists’ appetite preference, serving a mix of Nepali, Chinese and Indian food. The government taxes and service charges are often not shown or included in the menu prices. A bottle of beer costs about $3.TransportationGetting There: Nepal’s only international airport is the Kathmandu International Airport. There aren’t that many direct flights from outside of Asia to Nepal, but a popular route is to fly into India before heading Nepal. Getting Around: Due to the bad roads, it can be quite a challenge to get around in Nepal. Local buses are cheap but always cramped and uncomfortable, plus it could be painful to figure out the (lack of) schedule and stops. The safest way to get around is with a private car, which always come with a driver in Nepal. In tourist areas like Kathmandu and Pokhara, taxis are safe and cheap to get around. Finally, there are 3-wheeled vehicles called tempos within the cities that leave when full and follow a fixed route.Inter-city Traveling: There are long-distance buses catering to tourists, which are in better condition and more comfortable than regular buses. However, regular buses are very cheap, with some of the longest distance routes costing as low as $10. Outside of the popular tourist routes, one can rent a shared jeep to get from one city to another, which is cheaper than a regular taxi. There are 20-odd domestic airports as well if you plan on doing a lot of domestic travel. Things to DoTrekking the Annapurna Circuit or Everest Base Camp: Trekking is possibly the #1 reason for visiting Nepal for most people. The most popular months are September and October with the second highest season taking place in March and April. If you prefer a guided trek, there are companies and individuals that offer guiding services in English and other major languages, and you can also pay for a porter to help carrying your bags during the trek. Personally, I wanted to trek the Annapurna Circuit without a guide, and did that without much difficulty. It was a stunning trek that I will remember for a lifetime.Holi Festival: Holi is a colorful festival celebrated by the Hindus. It is observed to obtain God’s blessing for the rest of the year. The dates of the festival vary each year so check beforehand. The celebration itself may remind one of the Songkran Festival celebrated in most parts of Southeast Asia, except that for Holi Festival, it is colored powder being splashed. Put on clothes you do not mind getting stained, bring little cash and make sure to keep yourself hydrated throughout the celebration.Paragliding in Pokhara: I tried paragliding in Nepal and it was beautiful looking down at the lake and rice paddies from above, and I remember thinking to myself “so this is how having a pair of wings feels like” the whole time. A popular place to do it is in Pokhara, which is a 6-hour bus ride from Kathmandu and the start of the Annapurna Circuit. You can book ahead online but it is cheaper to book directly with your guesthouse or with an agency directly. Rato Machhendranath Festival: I was lucky to have witnessed this celebration by accident in 2014. The Rato Machhendranath Festival is a celebration that involves a coconut being thrown from the top of a tree-like float by a priest, and local men fighting over each other to catch the coconut. It is one of the oldest and most important festivals in Nepal, one that is little known to tourists – my buddy and I were the only foreigners there! Similar to the Holi Festival, the date is not fixed but it takes place between April and May so check with your hostel. Recommended Products"

That being said, Peru has a vibrant backpacker scene, which means company is easy to find. So if you are traveling solo, don't worry, it's easy to meet others. As always, be mindful of your belongings and always trust your instinct.Climate: Peru is one of the most geographically diverse countries in the world. As a result, visitors can expect different microclimates in one day, regardless of the time of the year. Keep that in mind when you are packing. For instance, if you are hiking, be prepared for cold weather but also bring along sunscreen. In general, high season starts from June - August, rainy season typically runs from September - April. April - May and October - November are great for avoiding crowds. Best SIM cards: Movistar is the largest and most reliable telco company in Peru, followed by Claro. 2 GB worth of data could cost less than $10. Be aware of the black market for both SIM cards and credit vouchers. It's best to purchase your SIM card at authorized retail shops, and to avoid purchasing from street vendors.Random useful tip: If you are planning on hiking the Inca Trail or the Rainbow Mountain trek, save it for the end of your trip, when you have acclimated to the altitude. For more useful tips about weather and best places to go, check out my friend Becki's Peru guide.AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($10 - $20): Thanks to its vibrant backpacker scene, Peru has a bunch of awesome hostels with great location and facilities to offer. In Lima, there’s the perfectly located, laid back Dragonfly Hostel; In Cusco, consider staying at Ecopackers, a beautiful vintage house built nearly 500 years ago; In Huacachina, Banana’s Adventure is a great place to stay and meet people, especially at the poolside, or during one of the many activities they organize.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($25 and up): Mid range hotels are widely available in major tourist areas such as Lima and Cusco. Tierra Viva Miraflores Mendiburu in Lima is decent and strategically located. Affordable studios on Airbnb are great alternatives to hotels. Expect to pay about $25 - $50 per night. For a unique accommodation experience, consider the Skylodge Adventure Suites hanging on the side of a cliff in the Sacred Valley of Peru.TransportationGetting There: The main airport is Jorge Chávez International Airport, located in Lima. Direct flights are available from the US and Canada, whereas a layover or two is usually required from Australia, the UK and New Zealand. Crossing borders overland from neighboring countries like Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Bolivia is straightforward, usually by buses that are reliable and comfortable. Finally, if you are in no rush at all, slow boats up the Amazon cruising through Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, including Iquitos, could be an interesting experience.Getting Around: Mototaxis and colectivos are the common means of getting around town for locals. They are affordable albeit not the most comfortable nor safest choice. It's quite common to pack double the amount of people in the car than there are seats or seatbelts. Many locals offer their private cars as taxis by putting up a taxi sign, however a meter is usually not available, so be sure to agree on a price before getting in. Local buses are slow and crowded, and you will need decent command of Spanish in order to figure out when to get off. However, they are definitely a cheap option and an adventure on its own. In major cities like Lima and Cusco, Uber is also available and fairly affordable. Inter-city Traveling: For a country as vast as Peru, domestic flights and buses are the best way of getting around effectively. On top of that, some jungle areas are only reachable by plane. During high season, tickets should be booked well in advance. There’s also a fair chance of flight cancellations, delays, or even early departures due to weather conditions, so make sure you leave room for serendipity, and be properly insured for it as well. Another awesome option is via train. Taking the long distance train in Peru is an experience on its own, and with that said, tickets should be booked in advance especially during high season. For travelers on a budget, your best bet is on the long distance buses, which run regularly and are mostly punctual. Cruz del Sur is the best company. If you're going long distance overnight, splurge for the full-cama seat which reclines 180 degrees!FoodLocal Groceries and Cheap Eats: I bought my own groceries from the local supermarket for the trails, and $30 worth of groceries was enough to last me for 4 full days. At the local restaurants, look for the menu del dia which lists dishes that tend to cost 4-6 soles, and usually consists of a main and a soup. The menu will be in Spanish, so learn some of the dishes! Street Food: Street food is all over Peru in varying degrees of safety. While I'd pass on street ceviche, keep a lookout for anticuchos, a classic Peruvian street food staple, empanadas, which are pies filled with meat or cheese (yum!), and the overfilled sandwiches. For dessert, try arroz con leche, which is a local rice pudding. Street food in Peru is generally safe, though you should avoid anything that looks like it has been left out in the sun for a while.Restaurants & Bars: With dynamic biological and climate conditions comes huge variety of food choices. In the major cities, you can easily find both local and international restaurants with varied menu options, whereas along the coastline, fresh seafood is a must-try. If you are up in the mountains, expect to find creativity in their potato-based dishes, such as papa rellena. Other popular Peruvian dishes include ceviche, which consists of a mixture of different seafood cured with citrus, pachamanca, a delicious roast, and for the more daring, cuy (aka guinea pig), which is typically roasted whole. You can also find pizza, pasta, hamburgers, and other western food options in touristy areas. Expect to pay about 15 - 25 soles per meal.Things to DoRainbow Mountain - This Insta-famous mountain layered with shades of red, yellow, and green has become Peru’s icon. It’s absolutely beautiful in person, but be aware of the altitude and make sure that you are physically fit enough for a challenging hike. That being said, there are several ways to reach the mountain, porters and horses are available, so if you are in the area, do not give this spot a miss.The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu - This moderately difficult hike is typically done over the course of four days and three nights, through gorgeous valleys and around sharp, sloping mountains. It’s one of my favorite hikes I’ve done in Peru. If you are looking for a comfortable yet unique trail to do in Peru, this will do the job!Humantay Lake - This gorgeous lake is what you’ll see on day one of the Salkantay trek, should you decide to do it, or it can be done as a day trip from Cusco. The drive from town takes about 3 hours, and most trips pickup around 3am. The climb is steep in parts, but the end reward of Humantay Peak is a worthy reward.Laguna 69 - I will always remember gazing at the blue lake decorated with a small waterfall trickling down into it, forgetting the fatigue caused by thin air. Laguna 69 is impressive to say the least. It’s easy to understand why it’s right at the top of the list for most people visiting Huaraz in Peru. You will need to prepare for the logistics and altitude, but as long as you are a fairly confident hiker, I highly recommend doing this.Santa Cruz - It was a photo of the Cordillera Blanca mountain range that ignited my interest in hiking Santa Cruz. I did this hike solo and I would totally recommend it if you are planning on a solo trek in Peru, too. The trail is obvious for the most part, is a fairly popular trail so you will have plenty of chances to meet others, and is, at the same time, isolated enough so you could avoid seeing others by selecting less popular trails or campsites that tour groups do not camp at. It’s definitely one of the prettiest trails I’ve done.Huascaran National Park - Huascaran National Park lies in the Cordillera Blanca mountains and is one of the trekking capitals of the country. While not as popular as the Inca Trail, this national park has towering mountains over 6k meters to please mountaineers, plenty of glaciers, and multiple day and multi-day treks like Laguna 69 and the Santa Cruz trek. It's just stunning.Sandboarding in Huacachina - So. Much. Fun! It’s not just the sandboarding and sledding, but also the entire experience which is a lot of fun filled with adrenaline. The best time to get there is before sunrise or sunset. If you have the budget, take a scenic flight over the Nazca Lines, a stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site, with over 70 designs etched into the earth, ranging from simple geometric shapes to more complex animals and human figures.Visit the Plaza de Armas - For a relaxing day in Cusco, check out Plaza de Armas, and enjoy great restaurants, cheap massages, quirky souvenirs, and later in the evening, dance troupes. The plaza itself is beautiful, and I recommend walking through it at night just after the sun goes down and all the buildings on the hillsides light up - super beautiful!Explore Moray - The perfect circles in Moray are an agricultural ‘laboratory’ with several terraces of varying temperatures, presumably for more effective farming. Many day trips combine Moray and the salt mines of Maras for about $24. Just hit the town in Cusco and you will see them advertised everywhere, or you can book in advance with a trusted company.Salinas de Maras - Another classic icon of Peru, the salt mines of Maras is about an hour drive away from Cusco. Expect to see thousands of pools of salt all along a hillside that opens up into the Sacred Valley. Workers manually scrape out the salt on the pond surfaces and are hard at work as the tours of the mines take place. It’s amazing to see an Incan creation that’s still in use for its original purpose.Visit the Amazon - More than half of the country is covered by the Amazon rainforest, so it will only make sense that you make it a point to explore it! Swim in the river with pink river dolphins, spot sloths in their habitat, fish for piranha, zipline through the rainforest, and stay on a floating lodge deep in the Amazon, completely off the grid, running on solar power. It’s an amazing experience that you'll never forget. Recommended Products"

For those who love diving, it doesn’t get much better than French Polynesia. This is a country I know I will be returning to again and again. Quick Tips‘Hello’ and ‘Thank You’ in Tahitian: “Ia Ora na” – pronounced yo-rah-nah, and Mauru’ uru – pronounced mah-roo-roo‘Hello’ and ‘Thank You’ in French: “Bonjour” and “Merci Beaucoup”Currency: Pacific Franc (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: 90 day visa-on-arrival available for most nationalities (click here for more information)Solo Travel Friendliness: The French Polynesians are, hands down, some of the sweetest people I’ve ever met in my life. I felt welcome everywhere I went – despite the language barrier, everyone I met was ever-smiling, warm and friendly. That being said, most areas including Bora Bora and Tahiti, are such honeymoon destinations that you may find yourself at times awkwardly sandwiched between honeymooners at restaurants and excursions, but that should not stop you from visiting those islands, or the many others! Climate: Dry and pleasant from June – Sep (Society/Tuamotu Islands) or Aug – Dec (Marquesas) in the tropics (elsewhere hit and miss, Australs slightly like Society/Tuamotu). These are also the busiest months with more tourists and potentially higher prices. To save cost, travel during shoulder seasons (May, October, July (Marquesas), or late December/January (Marquesas)Best SIM cards: Vini – cards can be purchased at the airport and designated sales points. Coverage is fairly limited and you are likely to only get enough data for essential tasks like navigating and such.Random useful tip: Saying hello in Tahitian goes a long way, and just about everyone will say it to you with the hang loose sign. AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($30 – $50): There are only a handful of hostels in French Polynesia, which cost about $30. However, you can quite easily find budget private rooms on Airbnb and Booking.com for less than $50, and they usually come with a pool and complimentary breakfast. The Internet at most budget accommodations will not be fast, if provided at all, so you can expect to be offline most of the time. If you are really on a budget, there are campsites.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($55 and up): In Bora Bora, you can either stay in one of the mid-range hotels that cost about $100 – $150 per night, or live like a queen in one of the big luxury hotel chains like St. Regis, Four Seasons and the likes, which can cost about $2000 per night. Options with an in-between price point are, for some reasons, fairly limited. In Tahiti, there are more mid-range hotels that cost about $55 – $160 per night.  TransportationGetting There: The only international airport in French Polynesia is Faa’a International Airport, situated in Tahiti. The island’s isolated location means expensive flights, though I was able to fly in at just $801 through awesome travel deals. Most flights to Tahiti include a stopover in Australia and Auckland. From the United States, there are direct flights from Los Angeles, Honolulu, and sometimes San Francisco (seasonal).Getting Around: On the island, renting a scooter is the best way to get around. The roads are calm, and you can stop whenever you want (trust me, you will want to!). Some hotels provide bicycles for their guests, which is great for a quick ride to the restaurant or beach. Renting a car is very expensive, I’d only do so if I have at least 3 other people to split the cost. An air pass ($315 – $748) will make more sense if you plan on doing quite a bit of island hopping. If you have more time than money, and are willing to get off the beaten path, some cargo ships are happy to take people in for as low as $14, though that would require you to speak at least some French and rely on your luck!FoodLocal Snack Bars and Food Trucks ($10 – $15): Stick with local food, which include fresh seafood, suckling pig and more coconuts than you can imagine. Eat at snack bars and food trucks, and you can easily keep your daily food budget under $15 and likely eat better food than what the restaurants could offer.Restaurants & Bars ($15 – $50): A dinner at a mid-range restaurant costs about $20 – $30. Most hotels have in-house restaurants and you can expect to pay about $25 – $35 for a meal. There are plenty of bars and night clubs on the island, though alcohol tends to be expensive.Things to doDiving and snorkeling: It’s a stunning world down there! With more than 800 unique fish species and colorful coral reefs everywhere, you wouldn’t even know where to look. The diving condition is fantastic, and even just snorkeling is amazing. My favorite diving spot in French Polynesia is Fakarava, and I’d highly recommend you checking it out!Swimming with whales: Swimming with whales will be one of the more life-changing experiences of your life should you choose to do it. It’s moving, humbling, and awe-inspiring. In French Polynesia, humpbacks travel to Tahiti to birth their calves in the calm, warm waters off the island from August to October, making it the perfect time to swim with them. Tahiti and Mo’orea are the main spots to swim with whales.Island hopping: I mean, there are 118 islands (67 inhabited), after all! As mentioned above, consider getting an air pass if you plan on doing a bit of island hopping. The beaches are pristine, the water perfect for swimming, on some islands you might not see another soul all day – what more can you ask for?Hiking: There are many mountains and jungles on islands like Tahiti, Moorea, and the Marquesas. Typically, you’ll need a guide to find the trailhead and keep to the trail, since most trails are not well-marked. Recommended Products"

While most tourists are not victims of violent crime or political conflicts, theft is common, particularly in the citiesSolo Travel Friendliness: Warnings about the country’s unstable political state and tourist kidnappings are pretty scary, but in general I found the Philippines to be a friendly place for solo travelers. Some locals were curious why I was traveling all by myself, but I never felt unsafe or threatened in the Philippines. Use your common sense and stay away from the no-go zones in Mindanao, and always keep an eye on your belongings. The basic stuff goes a long wayClimate: Climate: Rainy season lasts from June to October in the western Philippines including Manila, while central/eastern Philippines, like Bohol, have no well defined season (including extreme south near Borneo like Bongao), even seeing more rain in easternmost parts, like Legazpi, during the opposite time of yearBest SIM cards: Globe offers the best data plansModesty Considerations: While fashion runs the spectrum in major cities like Manila, the Philippines are still relatively conservative – avoid flashing of bare skin especially when you are not on the beachRandom useful tip: Try to avoid the Philippines during Christmas as travel around the country becomes difficult and expensive.AccommodationBudget Solo Travelers ($7 - $15): Dorms are not as common in the Philippines as in the rest of Southeast Asia. Here, budget accommodation often means a small room with little more than a bed, 4 walls, and a small fan. However, do not be discouraged! Sometimes, all it takes is a beautiful sunset right in front of your bungalow to make up for it, and the Philippines definitely have a lot of that to offer. Book dorms ahead of time if possible, as cheaper beds with good ratings are often booked out very quickly. Finding other solo travelers to share a room with is also a good way to cut the costs.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($15 - $30): A private room at hostels starts at $15, which usually comes with free Wi-Fi and breakfast. Airbnb is on the rise in most major cities and tourist destinations, with a private fan room starting at $10 - $40. On the islands, expect to pay $20 - $30 for a bungalow with a private bathroom.FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 - $5): This is where the Philippines gets more affordable. Local food is generally cheap and delicious, with BBQ chicken with rice costing about $1. Small restaurants on the street offer adobo and lechon for about $2 - $3. Beer is very cheap, with a big bottle costing only $1.Restaurants & Seafood ($5 and up): American fast food culture is prominent in the Philippines. There are also small restaurants that serve rice and noodles with huge varieties of dishes. Mid-range restaurants serve local and western cuisine. Seafood is fresh and inexpensive – a large grilled fish from a beachfront restaurant runs around $10.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Manila), Mactan-Cebu International Airport (Cebu), and Francisco Bangoy International Airport (Davao).Getting Around Town: Jeepneys are repurposed, wildly painted American jeeps that roam around all major cities in the Philippines serving as the main public transportation. There are no fixed schedules or bus stops. The routes are painted on the windows, and they are simply hailed and stopped by passengers. Make sure to get on one to experience the Philippine transportation icon and hang out with the locals. Another fun way to get around town is on a tricycle, which is usually available in the rural areas. Uber has also recently arrived in Philippines.Inter-city Traveling: Long distance bus routes cover pretty much the entire country, making inter-city traveling efficient and relatively easy. 12Go Asia is an excellent online booking website if you would like to book your trips ahead, though it is entirely possible to just show up and hop on a bus at the bus station. From island to island, ferry, or bangka is the way to go, and domestic flights are also available if you prefer flying from a city to another.Things to DoDive in Coron: Palawan is, in my opinion, the best diving spot in the Philippines. Hop on a liveaboard dive trip that consists of 3-4 dives per day and experience living on a boat like a sailor (or pirate)! Diving through the Coron Wrecks and Apo Reef was an amazing experience. Here’s a review and video to give you an idea of what’s in store for you.Island Hopping: Hop from Coron to El Nido (you will see plenty of signs for ferries on Coron), and from El Nido, take an hour’s bike ride into the stunning Twin Beach – Nacpan and Calitang. There are also many other beaches in El Nido worth checking out so make sure to allocate sufficient time for it. Continue your way to Puerto Galera, a relaxing island with great diving opportunities. Sail through Bacuit Archipelago, Philippines’s version of Halong Bay. Next, take a short flight out to Boracay – it may have turned into a big tourist trap, but it is still beautiful and worth spending a few nights in. The island is notorious for its all-night party scene, so let loose and have fun!Relax at Camiguin: I spent Christmas Day on this friendly island in 2013, and it was one of my favorite X’mas celebrations ever. I loved it for its relaxing atmosphere and diving. Spend a few days here and hang out with the locals, or simply enjoy the solitude that’s hard to come by these days in Southeast Asia.Explore Manila: The capital of the Philippines has the country’s inequality on full display, with huge mansions and small houses barely held up by wooden planks next to each other. This alone could make a slow stroll in the city an interesting affair. Visit the National Museum of the Philippines to get a better understanding of the country’s history, and check out Fort Santiago for a quick escape from the city.Skydive Greater Cebu: Swimming with the whale sharks and the majestic Tumalog Falls are great, but just when you thought you’ve seen it all in Cebu, there’s one more cool thing you can do – skydiving! Just north of Cebu unfolds Bantayan Island, home to some of the best beaches in the Philippines and one of the only places in the Philippines where you can skydive.Trek to the Asik-Asik Falls: This waterfall was only discovered in 2010. Imagine powerful water streaming down a mountain cliff that is fully covered in green – I have never been there myself, but the pictures look absolutely stunning. This is not your average waterfall, for sure. Getting there involves descending and ascending on stairs that wind around the mountainside, but I am sure the view alone would be worth the effort.Get to the Top of Chocolate Hills: There are mixed reviews about the mysterious Chocolate Hills of Bohol. Some love and others are underwhelmed by them. Explanations for the formation range from a self-destructed volcano to legends about how the Chocolate Hills are essentially a giant buffalo’s poop. If you are confident on two wheels, getting there via the 2-hour ride from Panglao in Bohol province could be just as fun and challenging as actually being there. Recommended Products"

The gesture is called “Chope” among the locals. Try doing that to make sure you get a seat, and do not “steal” seats that are already reserved!AccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($12 - $15): Unlike its neighbors, accommodation in Singapore is relatively costly – it is almost impossible to find a $5 dorm here. That said, most hostels in Singapore are squeaky clean, air-conditioned and well located. They also usually provide breakfast and offer excellent Wi-Fi. You will find most budget accommodations located in Bugis, Little India, and Chinatown.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($30 & up): Feeling fancy but still want to keep your budget for accommodation in check? Top up a little and you will find yourself in a beautifully decorated, pod-style hostel that offers more comfort and privacy than a regular dorm. A 3-star hotel room typically costs $70 - $120, whereas luxurious accommodations such as Marina Bay Sands and Raffles Hotel could easily cost $300 - $400 a night. Airbnbs and Couchsurfing are popular in Singapore as well.FoodLocal Food Spots ($5 - $10): Street food in Singapore takes variety to a whole new level. You will find yourself spoilt with choice in any local hawker centre, with stalls offering both local and international cuisine. My personal favourite are the carrot cake (with no carrot!) and Bak Kut Teh (pork ribs soup). Be sure to check out Maxwell Hawker Centre, Golden Mile Food Centre and Chinatown Complex Food Centre.Cafes and Restaurants ($15 - $50): Café culture is very prominent in the Little Red Dot, with café-hopping being one of the most popular weekend activities among locals. Just be sure to make a reservation beforehand, otherwise you might find yourself waiting for an hour for a table. As for restaurants, seafood is a Singapore specialty. Indulge on one night and try out the infamous Chili Crab. A typical meal in a restaurant could cost anything from $30 to a kidney.TransportationGetting There: The only airport in Singpaore is Changi International Airport. Just like the rest of Singapore, the airport is small but mighty. It is one of the main airhubs of Southeast Asia, and direct flights are available from the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the entire Southeast Asia. Crossing borders overland is possible through Malaysia, though you’d want to avoid peak hours as there are thousands of Malaysians crossing over for work on a daily basis.Getting Around: BMW is the way to get around in Singapore – Buses, MRT, Walk! Public transportation is excellent and cheap, making it super easy to get around. For instance, you can get from Changi Airport to Orchard by MRT for about $1. Local buses are air-conditioned and clean, and they are a fun way to get around town the local way. It is also safe to walk around Singapore, with (mostly) shaded footpaths, crosswalks, and bridges everywhere. Just make sure to get yourself an Ezlink card that can be used for both trains and buses at a lower price.Other transportation options include local taxis, Uber and Grab.Things To DoStay in Touch with Nature: Visit the Gardens by the Bay (make sure to stay for the Grove Light show at the Supertrees in the evening!), Botanist Garden, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve and MacRitchie Reservoir Park. Who says Singapore is only a concrete jungle?Get Cultured: Check out the beautiful National Gallery Singapore, Singapore Art Science Musuem and National Musuem of Singapore. They are well constructed and interactive, and overall a wonderful way to get to know The Little Red Dot’s history and culture. If you are a bookworm like me, make sure to squeeze in some time for the beautiful library@Orchard.Get Wild with Animals and/or Roller Coasters: If you are interested in some thrilling fun, check out Singapore Night Safari and Universal Studio Singapore. It’s best to go in a group so make sure to say hi to your dorm mates and organize a trip together.The Night is Always Young: There are plenty of gorgeous bars, pubs and clubs in Singapore.

There’s really no need for negotiation when you can fill your tummy up to the point where moving becomes an obstacle with only $5, though!Cafes & Restaurants ($5 - $10): All major cities have dynamic café and restaurant scenes, serving local and international cuisine of all kinds. Inexpensive restaurants are typically located in shopping malls, costing about $5 for a complete meal. In Bangkok, there are specialty restaurants that serve “royal Thai” cuisine that use premium quality ingredients, giving classic Thai cuisine a royal spin. Fast food chains are available everywhere, with a set meal costing $3 - $5.TransportationGetting There: There are six international airports in Thailand, the most popular one being Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport, which is very likely to be your first and last stop in Southeast Asia. There are direct flights from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and all of Southeast Asia. Crossing borders overland is simple and cheap from its neighbouring countries using buses, trains and private cars.Getting Around Town: Options include Tuk-tuks, buses, moto taxis, cabs and songthaews. With Tuk-tuks and moto taxis, make sure to negotiate and confirm the price before you get in. You can also easily rent a motorbike or bicycle from shops and hostels. Make sure to check the vehicle’s condition and take pictures of any existing damages because while the rental and fuel is cheap, repair costs could make you drop your jaw. For solo travelers who can’t ride a bike, take a moto taxi. In certain areas like Chiang Mai, there are red Baht buses (Songthaews) that go everywhere including the airport for a fixed price of 20 THB within the city walls and slightly more to head outside of them. Uber and Grab are also available in major cities, though protests from cab drivers are making it difficult for them to enter and exit certain areas.Inter-city Travel: Long distance trains and buses in Thailand are efficient and comfortable for the most part. There are different classes (1st, 2nd and 3rd class for trains; VIP and non-VIP for buses) at different price points so how much an inter-city journey costs depends on how much you value comfort. Minivans are cheap but almost never come with assigned seats, and you will wait for the driver to pick you up at a designated bus stop, with the minivan usually already over occupied. As for island hopping, it is usually cheaper to get the bus/boat transfer packages than buying them separately. Always make sure that your valuables are close to you.Things to DoNorthern ThailandPlay with elephants: Get up and close with those beautiful, regal creatures. Pick a reputable organization that actually focuses on taking care of the elephants and not milking them for money. I personally recommend Elephant Nature Park in Chiang Mai, where the elephants are not threatened with sticks or hooks, and are given a chance to be elephants again.Take part in the local Festivals: There are two main festivals celebrated in the North – Songkran in April, and Yi Peng in November. Many people head to Bangkok for the annual water fight, but up North in Chiang Mai is where the real party’s at. Yi Peng in November involves releasing decorations made out of flowers and banana leaves down the river, and releasing lanterns up into the sky. Chiang Mai is also the place to be for this festival.Chill in Pai: Pai is a hippie haven about a 2.5 hour bus ride from Chiang Mai. Personally, I have returned 4 times. That says a lot about this place considering that I am always on the lookout for new places to discover. Rent a motorbike and ride to the waterfalls, canyons, and the land split.Check out the White Temple in Chiang Rai: Trust me when I say this temple is like no other. It started construction in 1997 and is on track to be finished in 2070. Words can’t describe the White Temple but you can check out my attempt here, or better yet, go see it yourself.Central ThailandHike Khao Yai National Park: While I have yet to check this national park out myself, I have only heard of good things about this place. It is apparently an excellent hiking and swimming spot, with opportunities to chance upon wild elephants. Sounds pretty darn good, if you ask me!Shop at Chatuchak Market: Known as the ultimate Bangkok market, Chatuchak stretches out more than half a mile, with more than 10,000 booths selling everything and anything. Dress light and put on sufficient sunscreen as you will very likely spend the entire day there.Picnic at Lumpini Park: I call this place Bangkok’s version of Central Park. Pack some light snacks with you, find a quiet spot to sit down and people watch. If you want to see how life is lived away from tourist-packed areas, this is the right place to be.Visit Thailand’s ancient capital, Sukhothai: Think Angkor Wat, minus the crowds. Rent a bicycle and explore the ruins by yourself.Southern ThailandGo Island Hopping: My personal recommendations include (but are not limited to) Koh Chang, Koh Yao Noi, Koh Pha Ngan, Koh Tao, Koh Samui, and Khao Lak. Whether it’s a quiet, isolated beach or a party island that you are looking for, there has to be an island that fits the bill. Read the complete list here.Join a 10-day Silent Meditation Retreat: There is a monastery on the mainland in the south of Thailand that offers a monthly 10 day silent meditation beginning at the end of every month. I attended the meditation that took place over New Year’s in 2013 and it was one of the more challenging but rewarding experiences of my travels.Apps to DownloadBangkokGate (helps finding routes when navigating through Bangkok via trains), Wongnai (an awesome local food guide) Recommended Products"

In Tanzania, you don't have to choose. From the famously warm beaches with white sand along the coast and Zanzibar to the equally famous Kilimanjaro, you've got both covered and more. If you love culture, you'll love spotting the colorfully-adorned Maasai and if you love wildlife, you'll fall in love with the Serengeti. Tanzania is an adventurous traveler's dream, whether you're on an organized safari, or for the particularly adventurous, self-driving or taking public transportation. If you truly travel across the country, you'll experience all kinds of different climates, sights, and cultures. And if you can manage to get through one day without Toto's Africa playing in your head 'sure as Kilimanjaro rises above the Serengeti,' I'm impressed!  Have you ever been asked whether you prefer beaches or mountains, and had to agonize over the answer?

Have a yellow fever vaccination certificate ready if entering ZanzibarSafety rating: Ranked 54 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 1.86 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40). While most tourists are not victims of violent crime, theft is common, particularly in big citiesSolo Travel Friendliness: I traveled mostly with other people in Tanzania. Most tourists in Tanzania take a safari or tour, and in this case you will be accompanied by safari guides or camp guards most of the time, and from first-hand experience, these trustworthy people will do everything to keep you safe in Tanzania. With that being said, petty crimes are common so always keep a close eye on your belongings and never walk at nightClimate: Warm summers (November to March) and heavy rains from Late February to MayBest SIM cards: Vodacom works surprisingly well and SIM cards cost 1000 TZS (except at the airport where they often ask for 5000) and 10 GB of data is available for just over $5 USD. Refill data by buying refill cards at small kiosksRandom useful tip: If you want beautiful beaches without the tourists, skip Zanzibar and go to the coastal areas closer to PanganiAccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($3 - $10): If you are on a shoestring budget, camping is possible as there are quite a number of campsites across Tanzania. Expect to pay $5 - $10 for a spot at campsites with basic amenities. Visiting during the rainy season (February – May) may result in lower pricing as well. Most safari packages also cover accommodation and food, so pick and choose depending on your budget and comfort needs.Mid-Range Travelers ($10 and up): A basic private room at a budget hotel costs about $30 - $40. Mid range hotels with better amenities cost about $60 - $70 for a double bedroom. There are many affordable lodges with swimming pool and in-house restaurants in the tourist areas, costing about $30 - $50 per night. Airbnbs average at about $40 for a private room, and about $75 for an entire unit.Other Accommodation Options: If your budget allows, splurge on a few nights and stay at a boutique lodge or a private villa. In Pangani, I spent a few nights at The Tides Lodge and The Mawimbi Villa, and I absolutely loved the experience. The Tides Lodge offers bungalows nestled in the sand, and they are literally steps away from the beautiful beach. The in-house restaurant was impressive and I fed myself quite well there! The Mawimbi Villa is perfect for travelers in a group. It’s a mansion with six animal-themed bedrooms right on the sand with a full-time private cook. Oh did I mention that it’s got an awesome pool as well?FoodLocal Eats ($1 - $5): Food can be unbelievably cheap or pretty expensive in Tanzania. On the mainland, expect to find meat stews and grilled meat at most restaurants; on the coast, seafood is the main dish. Fruit is incredible and fresh – I bought 20-odd mangoes for about $1.50. It is that cheap! Some famous Tanzanian dishes include Mandaazi, which resembles doughnut but with a savory twist, and Nyama Choma, a delicious barbeque meat.Restaurants ($10 and $15): Many hotels and lodges have on-site restaurants that serve authentic local and international cuisines. In tourist towns, mid range restaurants are widely available. The increase in the Indian population has also brought in more Indian cuisine establishments. Coffee is popular throughout the country so make sure to have a cuppa! A bottle of beer costs about $2. While tipping is not expected, good service should be rewarded as restaurant staff tend to be very low paid in Tanzania. TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Kilimanjaro International Airport and Julius Nyerere International Airport. There are direct flights to these airports from Europe, Southeast Asia (Bangkok and Hanoi), and Mumbai. Crossing the border overland is possible from most of its surrounding countries, through buses or private cars. If you are crossing the borders with a private car, make sure to have the right documentation with you.Getting Around: Minivans are called Dalla-Dalla in Tanzania, and they cover a wide range of routes throughout the country. A single ride costs less than $0.2, though there’s no fixed schedule, and they are always overpacked. Taxis are unmetered so make sure to agree on a price before you get on to one. Uber is currently only available at Dar Es Salaam. The best way to get around in Tanzania is through a rental car. Rental is straightforward and inexpensive, however be extra cautious when driving at night as there are no lights, and expect to be pulled over by the police for any minor infractions.Inter-city Traveling: Long distance buses cost about $1 per hour. Ferry between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar costs about $35 - $40 for a standard one-way ticket. If you have plenty of time, consider taking the train, which is a great way of enjoying the fine view of Tanzanian countryside. There are two railway companies, Tazara and Central Line. A first class inter-city ticket starts from about $13. For overnight trains, pack some food and drinks with you as the basic meals offered may not be enough.Things To DoGo On An Epic Road Trip: If you want turquoise blue water, if you want to climb the highest mountains in Africa, and if you want to see the most ferocious and colorful beasts of the continent, Tanzania is the place. This country really does have it all for adventurers who want a real taste of Africa. So don your safari hat, grab your binoculars, and go on an epic road trip across Tanzania. My road trip covered 8 different destinations, where I followed the “northern circuit” and added a few random spots here and there.Explore The Ngorongoro Crater: Ngorongoro means “the gift of life”, and indeed, with the jungle along the rim so lush and green, the name is perfect for this beautiful place. I recommend spending a day at the Ngorongoro Crater, as the place is pretty small and animals like zebras, elephants, wildebeests, and if you are lucky, rhinos, can be easily spotted, as there aren’t a lot of places to hide. Big tip - spend the night at the crater, and get up super early the next morning so you have a better chance of spotting the rhinos.Do A Safari in Serengeti: The Serengeti is a wonderland for Safari holidays in Africa. Wild animals hunt, eat, play, swim, and sleep as you make your way through their playground. Though pricing can shoot through the roof, It is possible to do an afforable safari in Serengeti. You should hire a safari guide and a proper vehicle, but you can save money on accommodation by staying on the outskirts of the Serengeti in the conservation areas for some of the trip, or go during low season (January, February, April). Enjoy The Best Views In Tanzania: I was told that Lushoto has one of the best views in Tanzania, and obviously I had to put it to test. Result? I am happily convinced. The viewpoint is easy to access on foot. It takes about 2 minutes to walk there, give or take, from the Irente Cliff Lodge. Walk in, pay $0.50 to go through the lodge lobby, and then pay $1.50 to gain access to the viewpoint. Relax on Ushongo Beach: Now there are a lot of warm beaches in the world, where the water feels like it came out of a bath faucet. There are many with white sand and crystal clear water, it’s true. But what’s special about Ushongo beach is that there’s almost nobody on it save for a local passing by here and there, and that, to me, is always perfection. Here, you can stay at a beautiful lodge, go snorkeling on a sandbar that disappears at night, go kayaking in the ocean and mangroves, and lounge under the shade.Explore Stone Town and the beaches of Zanzibar: During the day, white sand, aquamarine waters, and sideways sail boats sum up Zanzibar. You can easily spend the day lounging on the rope and wooden chaise chairs, SCUBA diving in the clear waters with octopus and Napoleon Wrasse, and joking around with the locals who live in the area. When the sun goes down, head to one of the reggae bars and dance the night away. Pretty good life, ain’t it? Recommended Products"

People are friendly and outgoing, and the streets are generally safe and easy to navigate. There are places where crime rates are high, and I will not pretend like the current political state of the country is great, but as far as traveling and exploring solo go, the US is still a fun place to beClimate: Since the US is so big, the climate varies quite a bit. In coastal California, plan on long and dry summers and don't expect to encounter snow, but as soon as you head to the mountains it could be dumping down. On the East Coast, plan on gorgeous fall foliage and in the midwest, expect long and snowy wintersBest SIM cards: T-mobile pre-paid plans are the cheapest in the US, particularly if you buy the SIM card at Walmart.

The couchsurfing community is huge in the States - it started in this country, after all! If you are going on a road trip, consider renting or buying then selling a campervan so you can save on accommodation as well. While hostels are not popular, cheap motels and inns are widely available in major cities and on the highways. Price range-wise, it largely depends on which city you are traveling to. Click on the individual states on the map to read more.Mid-Budget Solo Travelers ($35 and up): Hotels with style ranging from budget to boutique to extravagant can be found throughout the country. In the cities, indulge a few nights at the mid range hotels which cost about $70 - $200, with great facilities like a gym and pool included. Airbnb is an awesome accommodation choice, especially in the countryside. You can find adorable tree houses, modern apartments, and seaside bungalows, depending on budget and location. A private room typically starts at about $25, and an entire unit at $80.TransportationGetting There: There are more than 5000 public airports in the country that see close to a million travelers from all around the world traveling in and out of the States on a daily basis. A few things to note about America’s airports: if you are locking your bags, make sure the locks are TSA approved; security is strict and in some states like California, a 30 – 60 minute wait through security should be expected. Crossing overland from Canada and Mexico is relatively straightforward. Expect the possibility of having your car searched and make sure that you have all of your documents, visas, and insurance ready. Getting Around Town: Public transport varies wildly from city to city and some places, like New York, have excellent public transport while others, like Los Angeles, have terrible public transport options. Generally, buses and trains in major cities are cheap. Cycling is also increasingly popular. Metered taxis, Uber, and Lyft are widely available. Driving could be stressful in the cities, but it is certainly a convenient way to get around. Most car rental companies have outlets at the main airports, and it is also easy to rent a car in major cities.Long Distance Traveling: Given the distance between one state and another in the country, it is important to plan ahead and if possible, arrange your transportation in advance. Flying is the easiest and fastest way to travel between cities, especially on Southwest Airlines, the country’s best budget airline. The railway system, dominated by Amtrak, is another option though the network is not comprehensive, and the tickets are sometimes more expensive than flying. If you plan to make a lot of stops along the way, traveling by bus or a rental car would be ideal. Hitchhiking is pretty common along the highway, though it could be illegal in some states.FoodGrocery Shop & Cook Your Own Food ($5 - $10): To save money, you can buy your own groceries at the local supermarkets and farmers markets and cook your own meals. There are also all kinds of small casual eateries, and food trucks that sell fresh and delicious snacks and mains for cheap.  The American staples include steaks, hotdogs, and burgers, though in cities like San Francisco and New York City, healthy, raw-based diet is on the rise. The variety depends heavily on where you are, with lots of international options along the coasts and more diners and fast food in the small towns in middle America. Restaurants & Bars ($10 - $30): It’s not just about burgers! The culinary scene in the USA is varied and inventive, thanks to all of the different cultures. From casual cafes to funky food trucks, to hole-in-the-wall style restaurants, to hippie cafes, to high end restaurants, There’s so much to discover as far as food goes, and especially in the major cities. Expect portions to be big. Most major cities are buzzing with nightlife and it’s easy to find a nice place for a night out as well. *Tipping: Due to a low minimum wage, tipping is not just common, but expected. It’s customary to tip 20% in restaurants, which may seem high, but it’s our culture - unless the service is particularly bad, then you should let the restaurant know, and they may refund your meal.Things to DoGo on a road trip: Whether it’s the Pacific Coast Highway road trip, or the American Southwest road trip, renting a car and driving various routes in the country is the best way to see just how massive and beautiful America is. Experience Authentic Hawaii on Molokai: If you want to find how how Hawaii was 50 years ago, go to Molokai. While the island sometimes has the rep of being unfriendly, the locals tell me they just want the right tourists - the ones who don’t want to change Molokai, but who want to learn, appreciate, and be transformed by it instead. It is my favorite place in Hawaii, where I swam under the 250-foot Mooula Falls, found a secret beach, and experienced a traditional ritual that involved the Aloha. Molokai may not have fancy resorts, 5-star restaurants, spas, or even traffic lights. I might be covered in mud and mosquito bites from the Halawa Valley, but this is my happy place.Hike Coyote Gulch in Grand Staircase Escalante in Utah: Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument is a massive sequence of sedimentary rock formations stretching from Zion to the Grand Canyon. It’s an outdoor enthusiast’s dream with hiking, rock climbing, bouldering adventures, 4×4 roads, and wide open spaces that you can climb all over and free camp in. There are thousands of hikes you could do in the Grand Staircase, so pick one that best fit your schedule and fitness. Sail the Apostle Islands in Wisconsin: Charter your own private boat and go sailing! The sea caves of the Apostle Islands are incredible in person. The islands are also home to Lake Superior, the world’s largest fresh water lake. Other activities include kayaking, hiking, and camping. The jumping off point for the Apostle Islands, the town of Bayfield, is also a lovely and artist-friendly place worth visiting. Visit Sun Valley in The Winter at Idaho: There’s just so much to do in Sun Valley in the winter. The hot springs with various temperatures allow visitors to hop back and forth between the cold and hot waters; the powdery, snowy mountains are perfect for skiing and snowboarding; snowshoes can be rented for a beautiful walk in the snowing mountains, and the town is buzzing with warm hospitality – can you tell that I had a really good time there?Visit Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming: Grand Teton National Park is beautifully blanketed in white during winter, making it a perfect spot for snowshoeing. If the crowded Yellowstone is not your cup of tea, you can seek refuge in Grand Teton – it took me one and a half hour before seeing another soul. Visit Antelope Canyon: No trip to Arizona is complete without seeing the incredible Antelope Canyon, a striped and bright orange Navajo Sandstone canyon in Arizona carved by flash flooding and erosion. There are actually two of them, and both canyons are located on Navajo land. The only way to see them is by taking a guided tour. I only saw Navajo guides, which made it feel more authentic and connected. Visit both if you can, but if you can’t, I posted a comparison of the upper VS the lower Antelope Canyon for you.Explore New York City: It’s crowded, it’s busy, it never sleeps, it’s a place where everything becomes a possibility, it’s a concrete jungle where dreams were made of (I’m sorry if the song is stuck in your head now!). Check out Brooklyn, relax and people watch in Central Park, get to the top of the Empire State Building, see Times Square, or simply explore the entire city freely. Recommended Products"

Strong Wi-Fi and free breakfast are provided at most hostels, some even offer free beer at certain hours! When I visited Vietnam in 2014, I was very pleased with the quality and cleanliness for the money I paid for most dorms I stayed at, and I am sure things could only get better since then. Here’s my list of the best places to stay in Vietnam.Mid Budget Solo Travelers ($10 - $30): Budget hotels offer a basic private room for around $10. In major cities, Airbnbs are available at around $20 - $30 for a private room, and are usually very beautifully decorated by the friendly local hosts.TransportationGetting There: The main international airports are Tan Son Nhat International Airport (Ho Chi Minh City), Noi Bai International Airport (Hanoi), and Da Nang International Airport. There are direct flights from the US, Australia, and its neighboring countries, though an indirect flight routed through Singapore, Hong Kong or Bangkok is often cheaper. Crossing borders overland to Vietnam is possible from China, Cambodia, and Laos.Getting Around Town: Moto taxi via Uber and Grab is very cheap and efficient. For a more localized experience, take the local buses that cost $0.20 for a single trip. As for local taxis, only take Vinasun and Mailinh taxis, which are trusted and reputable companies that don’t fix the meters and will always agree to run the meter for you. Don’t negotiate, request the meter.Inter-city Traveling: Overnight buses and trains are cheap and comfortable, costing about $5 - $20 to get from one city to another – you also get to save on a night’s accommodation. There are also hop-on-hop-off buses that travel throughout the country from North to South and vice versa. Most hostels will have information on the routes and prices. Keep a lookout for cheap domestic flight tickets as they can cost as low as $20.FoodLocal Food Spots ($1 - $3): The best Vietnamese food is found on the streets. There are many food stalls with tiny tables and even tinier chairs, and for $1.50 you can get soup, fresh spring rolls, rice with various accompaniments, or noodles with meat. A generally good rule of thumb is go to places that don’t have an English menu, are full of locals, and don’t have tablecloths. However, most places like that do not have prices on the menu, so make sure to agree on a price before you order. Another must-try is the Vietnamese coffee, which is amazing and usually costs only $1.Cafes and Restaurants ($3 - $8): Most sit down restaurants are cheap and delicious, with a complete meal costing nothing more than $3. Though based on my personal experience, they sell the exact same things as the street stalls, only with bigger tables and chairs! Cafes and bakeries introduced by the French sell great coffee, dessert and pastries for about $3 - $5. Fancier restaurants serve both local and western cuisine, expect to pay $5 - $8 for a meal. Beer is very cheap in Vietnam – you can get a “fresh” bottle in Hoi An for less than $0.5!Things to DoNorthern VietnamTrek the Rice Terraces and Stay with Hill Tribes: Take the overnight bus from Hanoi to Sapa, and book a trekking tour with the hill tribes - they normally gather at the bus station in the morning, dressed in colorful clothing. You can also book the tour ahead with your hostel in Hanoi. You will experience living with a hill tribe, eat and sleep with the family under the same roof, and admire the rice terraces that are just incredibly beautiful. Pack warmer clothes with you as the temperature can get pretty low especially at night.Explore Halong Bay: There are hundreds of tour companies, from crazy party boats, to luxurious cruise ships, and to relaxing slow boats with on-board cooking classes, that offer trips to this UNESCO World Heritage site – pick one that fits your style (and pocket) best. You will sleep in the middle of the 1600 islands and islets, swim, hike, eat, and chill on the beach. Waking up to seeing thousands of islands and islets around you is an experience like no other.Stay Off the Beaten Path in Phong Nha: Rent a bike and explore Phong Nha. Check out The Dark Cave, which is accessible by kayaking or swimming to the cave mouth. Paradise Cave is massive and unspoilt - one could spend hours in here, marveling at the shapes and seeing various things in them. But the best part of it all is to simply ride along the road and get lost on purpose. The views are beautiful and the people are some of the best I’ve met.Central VietnamGet Custom Made Clothes & Shoes in Hoi An: Hoi An is popular for making custom-made clothes and shoes at a cheap price, without compromising on quality. I got my leather boots made there and I loved them. Other than that, Hoi An itself is pretty, quaint, and the UNESCO Heritage site itself is located on the beach – that always draws me in.Eat Your Heart out in Hue: Hue is a quiet city that is often overlooked by most travelers. It was Bun Bo Hue, a beef noodles soup that drew me in the city, and I left Hue eating a lot more than just noodles. Click here or a more complete Hue food guide. Other than the food, Hue is also home to the beautiful Perfume River and impressive Tombs of the Emperors.Southern VietnamCross the Streets in Ho Chi Minh City: It’s absolutely terrifying to cross a road, any road, in Ho Chi Minh City. Everything seems to run in a sort of organized chaos of motorbikes and roundabouts in a city that still has some hints of French colonialism at every corner of the streets. When you’ve made it out alive, visit the museums and Cu Chi Tunnels to get a better understanding of Vietnam’s history and culture, and check out Ben Thanh Market, which stores everything from clothes and shoes to food and drinks.Relax and Unwind in Mui Ne: Mui Ne is famous for its sand dunes and Fairy Streams, and they are definitely worth checking out. If you are not into anything touristy, simply grab a book, order a beverage, and relax and unwind on the beach.Hang Out at the Elephant Falls: The Elephant Falls at Da Lat is impressive and beautiful on its own, but what makes it worth exploring is that you can climb on some difficult and slippery rocks to see the base of the falls, and rainbow, if you are lucky. Rent a bike and ride your way to the falls, but only if you are confident on sandy roads. Otherwise, you can hire easyriders or simply take a metered taxi over.Visit Yok Don National Park: This was where I felt like I was truly off the beaten path in Southern Vietnam. Yok Don National Park is a deciduous forest and the largest national park in Vietnam, with parts of it sitting along the Cambodian border. In this park, you can (and should!) simply laze on the banks of the river, go swimming, lay in hammocks, attempt to fish, and chat with whoever’s there. Recommended Products"

Quick Tips'Hello' and 'Thank You' in Xhosa:In most of South Africa, English will work just fine, but it's nice to know a bit of the most spoken language in the country as well -'Molo' (singular), 'Moweni' (plural), and 'Enkosi'Currency: South African Rand (click here for current conversion rates)Visa: 90 day visa-on-arrival available for most nationalities (click here for more info). MUST have a yellow fever vaccine to be granted entry if coming from a yellow fever-zone (such as other countries in Africa and much of South America)Safety Rating: Ranked 127 on the Global Peace Index with a score of 2.40 (USA is ranked 128 with a score of 2.40). While most tourists are not victims of violent crime, theft and robberies are very commonSolo Travel Friendliness: Tourist areas are generally safe. However, entering into townships or heading out at night alone will not be a good idea as they are where most crimes take place. This is in no way stating that South Africa is dangerous for solo travelers, in fact I met the most amazing people in this beautiful country – just use common sense as you would in anywhere else in the worldClimate: Warm summers (November to March) and cool and rainy wintersBest SIM cards: MTN – Cards can be purchased at the airport, authorized shops or major gas stations and supermarkets.Random useful tip: The best way to see South Africa is by taking a road tripAccommodationLow Budget Solo Travelers ($5 - $15): If you want to save money on accommodation, camping would be the cheapest option. There are many campsites all around South Africa, and some hostels have space that travelers can pitch a tent in. Expect to pay about $5 - $10 for a night. Another option is hostels, which cost about $10 - $15 per night. Free Wi-Fi is usually provided, though whether it works or not is a another question. Note that a guesthouse/hostel/tourist accommodation in South Africa is called a “backpackers.” I personally love this kind of accommodation since it’s all-encompassing and provides a diverse range of other travellers to connect with.Best hotels for mid budget solo female travelers ($20 and up): A basic hostel private room costs about $20. Hotels in South Africa are generally more expensive but offer value for money. A mid range hotel usually comes with free Wi-Fi, breakfast, a nice garden, a pool, and excellent service. Expect to pay about $40 - $60 for those. In areas outside of the main towns, you can get a private bungalow with beach view for about $50. Airbnbs are as low as $30 for a private room and about $85 for an entire unit. I recommend using it in Cape Town, as it provides better value than the hostels.Other Accommodation Options: I stayed at a permaculture farm that runs solely on solar power and offers outdoor showers (my favorite!) in Hogsback. You can volunteer in exchange for accommodation at some farms – I did that in the Karoo. There are also beautiful and luxurious eco-lodges located in the middle of nowhere, though those are usually very expensive.TransportationGetting There: The main international airport in South Africa is Johannesburg/O.R. Tambo International Airport, followed by Cape Town International Airport. Direct flights are available from North America, UK, Ireland, and Australia. Crossing borders overland, typically by car, from its surrounding countries is generally pretty easy. Make sure to have your yellow fever certificate with you if you’re coming from Tanzania and/or Zanzibar. Getting Around: Unlike much of Asia and Europe, there isn’t much public transportation in South Africa. There’s a metro train in Johannesburg that serves a few places and a muni bus in Cape Town but otherwise, transport is limited to minibus kombi taxis. Uber is available in Cape Town, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and Alexandria. There is also a private company geared towards backpackers called Baz Bus. However renting a private car is, in my opinion, the best way to get around. Car rentals are inexpensive, especially if you can find someone to share with.Inter-city Traveling: Buses the most reliable public transportation to get from one city to another if you’re not driving yourself. Greyhound and Intercape are some of the best intercity bus companies in South Africa. Departures are frequent, and the trips aren’t expensive. Trains are much slower than buses, but they offer comfort especially for overnight rides. If time is short, domestic flights are available across the 90 airports in South Africa and are often inexpensive, even last minute. Based on my personal experience though, a rental car is the best way to travel across the country - the roads are mostly good, petrol stations are plentiful, and driving allows you more access. For more, check out this extensive post I wrote on getting around South Africa on Nomadic Matt.FoodLocal Eats ($3 - $5): South Africa is a carnivore's paradise. The game meat here is top notch – think Kudu, Springbok, Zebra, Ostrich, and even Alligator. For an authentic South African cuisine experience, Be sure to check out Langa in Cape Town, and Soweto in Johannesburg. A plate full of meat, sausages, and pap run as cheap as $3. You could also save money by cooking your own food. Grocery stores are plentiful and have reasonable prices. Backpackers accommodation have communal kitchens where guests can cook and store their own food. It’s also worth checking out South Africa’s home-grown fast food chains, such as Spur and Nando’s where a meal starts at $3.Restaurants & Cafes ($10 - $20): Expect to pay about $15 - $20 for a 3-course meal at a mid-range restaurant. South Africa is a major wine-producing country, so it is only natural that the wine is exceptional and cheap, with a decent bottle costing as low as $4! Cafes are also on the rise especially in Cape Town, with a light meal with drinks costing about $10.Things to DoGo On A South African Road Trip: Not only is it the best way to see South Africa, a road trip will also give you the freedom to plan your itinerary and stops. South Africa is packed with different landscapes and activities so do your research and plan ahead. Renting a car and going on a road trip across South Africa also makes sense as the public transportation option is rather limited. I recommend going with a buddy (or 2, or 3, or 4!). It will make the whole experience more fun, and you get to take turns driving!Bungee Jump at Boulkrans Bridge: This one’s for the adrenaline junkies (like me). The bungee jump at Bloukrans Bridge is the “highest commercial natural bungee jump in the world,” at 216 meters (709 feet) of free-fall. The employees and overall atmosphere were great and the jump, well, you will have to experience it for yourself to know how it feels.Do a Few Short Treks: I did two short treks in South Africa that I thought were perfect, especially when short on time. Golden Gate Highlands National Park is home to many game animals. I remember seeing zebras, kudus, ostriches and more. The sunset reflection on the rocks is incredible (it’s how it got its name, after all). The trek itself takes about 3-4 hours and is suitable for beginners. Another option is the Drakensberg mountains, where I saw the second tallest waterfall in the world. Like Golden Gate, the trek takes about 4 hours to complete and it was a pretty easy hike.Wine Tasting at Stellenbosch: You are in one of the most popular wine-producing countries so if you enjoy wine, indulge in Stellenbosch!. My personal favorite variety was Pinotage, and I made sure to do a wine tasting and chocolate pairing while in Stellenbosch, Pinotage’s birthplace. The cherry on top was that I even got to blend my own wine and put a BMTM label on it!Experience a Farm Stay in the Karoo: I stayed at a farm in the Karoo with the coolest, loveliest, and sweetest hosts, Paula and her husband, E. I went cattle herding on foot with them, and took Paula’s advice to go to the rock labyrinth to find answers to questions I did not know I had. It is a transformative place that will leave a mark on your heart. If you do get there, make sure do some hiking in Graaff Reinet.Visit Cape Town: Cape Town is the place of models and movie stars, lovely mountians, glittering frigid waters, and a tourist favorite. It is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been to. The surroundings are also famously beautiful, and it’s the gateway to the garden route. Recommended Products"
https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ski-trip-packing-list/,The Ideal Ski Trip Packing List,Austria,"This winter, for the first time, I learned how to ski and most importantly, how to avoid turning into an icicle while doing so. I didn’t go skiing or experience snow when I was growing up, save for a few times when I was too young to really remember it. I had to ask a lot of questions about how to prepare and what to bring when I did start to put together my ski trip packing list. Everyone who grew up in a place with seasons finds this hilarious but I genuinely did not understand winter prior to experiencing it firsthand and making a few blunders, such as underdressing for the cold, over the course of January. However, I learned that even in -30 temperatures, with the right clothing just about any type of weather is doable and even if you’re buying a new winter wardrobe like I was, it doesn’t have to break the bank. I think I’ve got it down now, so without further ado, Your Ski Jacket is worth spending some money on in order to get something of quality. In all of my winter packing lists, I suggest spending money on shoes and jackets and going cheap on the rest if you’re on a budget. Ideally the ski jacket will be completely water-proof and will last several seasons. Remember the saying, “buy cheap, buy twice.” Mine is North Face brand (their designs are changing all the time, so this is a link to something similar to what I have but not the exact same), so it’s great quality and has lots of pockets for the ski pass, cameras, and my phone, as well as reflectors for night skiing and a bright color so that I’m easily visible on the slopes. The boots you wear when you’re not skiing are important, too. There are tons of other activities to check out when you’re on a ski trip that you’ll want good shoes for, like snow-shoeing, sledding (which requires that you use your feet as bakes), and even just walking around. They should be super warm and also waterproof. I’ve had the same pair for years now and even deep below freezing temperatures, with the right socks, they keep me warm and dry. Mine are Ugg brand and here is a similar and well-reviewed pair from Sorel as well. Your gloves are super important too, because if you’re like me, your hands and toes are the first parts of you to get cold almost immediately. I was pretty stoked to find a pair that normally retails for $99 for only $26, and can report that they served me well during my ski trip. Make your first base layer something pretty warm and resilient but not bulky. This is useful all winter long and I wear it all the time. I have a merino wool layer that’s functional and practical and that’s the most important thing in cold temperatures. Thankfully, this type of wool isn’t itchy for me as I usually have problems with wool.  The rest, I bought super cheap and used multiple times. Here’s the full ski packing list:   Since I’d never been skiing before, it didn’t make sense to me to buy the skis, ski boots, and poles before being sure that I liked the sport. I’d suggest just renting these on the ground once you get to where you’re going if you’re also new. That way, you can make sure you like the sport before investing in expensive gear. Most of the items listed above, however, are useful for winter sports in general. Happy skiing! This is really helpful! I’ll know exactly what to get when I (finally) go on a ski trip. Maybe next winter 🙂 🙂 This is a fantastic list! My daughter and i took a ski trip last year for New Years and what a DISASTER!  I wish I had had this list then.  We vowed (coming from Texas) that we would never do a winter holiday again..since then we have done our best to agree to try once again with the correct attire.  Thanks for all your posts Kristin they truly are an inspiration to me.  Stay warm 🙂 People with winter experience laugh at me because I’m such a newbie but honestly without anyone telling you or without firsthand experience, how are you supposed to know what to wear?! Glad you found this helpful! It really was totally fine and I was warm enough, even later when I visited Finland where it was -27, with the right clothes on 🙂 Thanks for posting this list! I’m actually moving to Finland in a few weeks time (yay!) And I know from when I visited last year, I did not have the correct clothing (I’m Australian so never really had winter before!) and I was freezing most of the time! I was wondering with the pants you linked to, were they true to size? Some of the reviews say the sizing is a bit off for them… Thanks again for posting this, it will be so helpful for me! I am thinking about going on a guided ski trip in the alps for the first time in my life. It is a daunting experience since I have not gone on a trip like this before. Knowing these tips, like to make the base layer warm but not bulky gives me a little more confidence in myself. hi. i live my whole life in a tropical country. it’s gonna be my first time to drive a car on winter setting come end of this november till first week of december. do i need to use winter tires?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/austria-winter-activities/,All the Ways to Enjoy the Winter in Austria,Austria,"I’ll be totally honest here, I wasn’t really sure that I was going to like visiting the Alps in the winter. I’d hiked all over them in the summer and thought they were breathtakingly beautiful, but after experiencing a couple of incredibly frigid days in Berlin, I was hesitant to take a mountain holiday. Up until recently, I’ve chased summer and never really experienced winter. I suppose most people from the US and Europe grew up with snow, or ski holidays, or both. I’m not one of those people, however, and I’ve only been to the mountains behind Los Angeles in the winter a couple of times, and never to ski. But you can’t travel and experience the world in only one season, and it was time to get out of my comfort zone and give winter a try. I realize now that I was missing out my whole life. Winter doesn’t have to be scary and cold – it can actually be tons of fun and it’s insanely beautiful! I don’t know why it took me til my 29th year of life to figure this all out. In January of this year, I visited the Austrian Alps and came to find that living in a snow globe world is magical, after all. Here are my favorite Austria winter activities: I learned how to ski in Austria and thanks to the variety of slopes, it was a good place to get instruction while my friends hit the slopes more suited to their various skill levels. My instructor, Zaki, was super patient and experienced, helping me to advance from beginner to blue slopes quickly. Only a week later, by the time I reached Finland, I was already hitting the red slopes and I owe it to learning how to ski properly from day one. I got my instruction and rentals from Alpin-Skischule and I liked this place in particular because the young owner is a sharp entrepreneur and I always love seeing that kind of thing from people my age, plus all the people who work there are so cool and laid back. Cherry on top is that the gear is super nice. I had no idea that it was possible to take a gondola up to the top of a mountain and sled down! That was a game-changer when I came across that possibility in Leogang. Apparently there are also tracks in Hinterglemm and Innsbruck. I thought it was an excellent use of the lift ticket after a long day of skiing when my legs were too tired to keep me going but I wasn’t done having fun. Snow-shoeing is another way to get a nice break from skiing. I was in Austria for nine days, so I wasn’t skiing for all of them and I also find that it’s nicer to ski in the morning and find other activities to do in the afternoon. You can rent some snow shoes and just take a walk in the snowy wilderness, or join a free organized hike, like the ones Saalbach. offers. Best of all, the hike can take you here: This is Austria’s ‘Golden Gate Bridge,’ followed by a tree walk. It’s open all year round but in the winter, I had it almost to myself. Apart from Steve, who took these awesome photos. It was an awesome day, and we could even sled back down after, which we took advantage of (of course). One of the best parts about choosing Austria for a winter holiday is the feeling you get when you’re there – it’s warm and cozy and I found that the locals were really kind and friendly, especially when I tried to speak German with them. While skiing in Saalbach-Hinterglemm, I really loved staying at Lengauer Hof, where the owner, the employees, and even the other people staying there, were so friendly with each other. The rooms are nice and big, the food is really good, the view is really beautiful, and right from the hotel you can go snow-shoeing and sledding on the mini slope next door. Biathlon is a sport that involves nordic skiing, which is on a flat track, then shooting a rifle at five targets. If the shooter misses a target, she/he has to go around the track one more time for every target missed. I had honestly never heard of this sport before but it’s big in Austria, especially in Fieberbrunn. Nordic skiing was confusing to me after learning Alpine skiing, but I sure did love the target practice part of it. Austrian food sticks to your bones. You seriously cannot go hungry while dining on Austrian food. My personal favorite was Xandl Stadl in Hinterglemm which serves a plate with grilled chicken, steak, pork, sausage, fries, and salad for, if memory serves, only €14. The food is farm-to-table and during the summer, the animals graze in the beautiful Alps. It was some of the most tender meat I’ve ever had. If skiing isn’t your thing, you don’t have to ski first to enjoy apres-ski (I won’t tell, promise). Apres-ski in Austria is really its own phenomenon. It’s basically a mountain hut that serves up drinks and German schlager songs with hilarious, repetitive, and sometimes PG-13 rated lyrics. The most ridiculous awesome apres-ski place that I found in Austria was the Goat Stall, which started out as just that – a goat stall. It’s a family-run hut that has rainbow lights and rows and rows of tables in the snow, plus a dance floor with a guy in a goat suit waving his arms to the songs. There’s a ‘beer selfie’ station where you take a selfie as the machine pours you a beer, and even some sound-proof goat stalls when you walk in. To get back down to town, have a seat and sled down the hill, it’s fun! Chances are good that if you go to Skicircus in Austria, you’ll want to take advantage of the whole resort and visit the three different areas that recently connected this year to make it the largest ski resort in Austria (you can read my full review of it here). In Leogang, the place to stay is definitely Mama Thresl. It’s super funky, incredibly well-designed, and is genuinely just a fun place to hang out. Ha! Get it? In Fieberbrunn, another area of the skicircus known for off-piste (backcountry) skiing, there’s another place you can’t miss – Hotel Alte Post. What set this place apart was the spa which is two stories of the hotel and has this super cool rooftop pool that opens from a heated room inside to the outside, where snow was falling and the neighboring church bells were ringing. It also had rooms with nothing but beds and headphones so that you can chill out after the pool or sauna. If you have more Austrian winter activities to add, let me know in the comments! I can’t wait to come back, this time with better ski skills, and conquer those mountains. *In the spirit of full disclosure, some of the companies above provided me with a free stay or service, however, I was not required to write a review as part of this. I wrote this because I chose to highlight those who provided an awesome adventure and all opinions are my own, as always.  I’m just eating up all your winter posts; I love them because a lot of bloggers do exactly what you said about avoiding winter. Imho winter is the best time to travel! Prettier with all the snow, not many tourists, lower prices… Glad you like the posts! I definitely want winter to be a fixture in my travels moving forward. Going to the Arctic circle twice and the Alps once this winter reinforced that. How else can you see the northern lights, ski, play in the snow, etc? Wow. This looks so amazing. Love that purple pool. I’m currently chasing summer around the world as you once did. But I’m from Michigan, used to winter, yet don’t ski. I really want to take a lesson like you did in order to feel more confident. Love all the photos and the magic of winter. It really is beautiful if you don’t have to drive to work in it! Activities like this are perfect! I love snow shoeing. Wonderful and beautiful post! Wow! The images are breathtaking! I like visiting the Alps in the winter and skiing (of course) and now I remember why I love them so much! These mountains have a special something that calls you to them wherever you are in the world I just stumbled across your blog on Pinterest, love to see how you feel about the country I’m living in. Austria really can be a stunner, if it’s not raining. Can’t wait for some skiing and ski hiking this winter <3 Wonderful post, true inspiration to everyone, it requires some extra effort and great interest to explore snow capped mountains and indulge in sport. Your travel experiences are intriguing.  Fantastic article, thanks for sharing this.  I can personally testify that spending time in the Austrian alps is an experience like no other.  You will have the fast paces and excitement of skiing during the day and then the relaxation of the evening’s spent in a warm and cosy lodge.  It’s something that should be very high on most people’s bucket lists.     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/skiing-for-beginners/,The Winter Newbie’s Guide to Skiing,Austria,"My mom tells me that I was four years old the first time I ever tried skiing. I don’t remember this, but she said rather than trying to learn how to ski, I just spent most of the time eating snow. Truth be told I still love eating snow (I know, don’t eat the yellow snow!), but now I’m also a lot more open to trying the sporty aspect of it as well. So at 29 years young, I took up the skis once again to finally learn how to do it properly. I was a little scared of learning how to ski due to a shoulder surgery I had a few years ago, plus, speeding face first down a mountain on two slick composite pieces seemed insane to me. I didn’t grow up in an area with much snow so winter isn’t something I’m used to, either. I was a beginner in every possible sense of the word. It’s all about baby steps, though, and now I really enjoy skiing. Here’s my guide on skiing for beginners and winter newbies in general: I know that your best friend, boyfriend, or parent probably thinks he/she knows all about skiing, but if you’re a beginner, or even a bit more intermediate or advanced, a proper instructor will make your learning experience so much easier. You can join a group class, but for me, a private instructor allowed me to excel much more quickly. I was already on the mountain and off of the practice slopes by day two because we were able to go at my pace and all of the instruction was aligned with my abilities and learning speed. A private instructor where I learned in Saalbach, Austria, runs at €80/day. The snow plow is what you do when you widen your legs and push the front of the skis closer together, like a pizza slice. One you learn how to turn, you’ll lean your upper body downwards and your knees towards the slope. This is another means of slowing down when going downhill. In time, you can snow plow less and let it go a little more when you’re comfortable with the speed and technique. Any time you just need to go slow, remember the snow plow. I saw kids who were only four years old on the slopes doing the same moves as I was, and realized that it’s not about physical ability. It’s really all mental. Additionally, if you start to get negative about the sport or end on a bad run and want to give up, please give it another try. I had a similar day and really just wanted to quit but the next day I had a much better run and finally found my groove. From then onwards I finally enjoyed it. Kids fall less and worry less because they aren’t worried about old injuries or getting confused about other sports they’ve played that involve different body movements, all of which plagued me. They just copy what the instructor does and tend to learn more quickly. The more scared you are and the more you stress about every little thing, the harder it will be. Skiing for a beginner will almost always involve a few falls and mistakes, but in time you’ll find your flow. Like absolutely every sport that I can think of, getting better just means practicing more. You might have an awesome run only to be followed by a run where you fall more, feel less confident, and need more encouragement. That’s totally okay, because if you think about everything else you’re good at, if you’re honest with yourself, you had ups and downs, right? Skiing is the same, especially as the conditions on the mountain change and you get tired. Don’t get discouraged, just keep going! Most of the time I was skiing was just spent with my instructor since my friends were all at a different level. I had a few Mozambique buddies visiting who were more interested in back-country snow boarding since they’re much more experienced than I am, plus a couple of skiers who were more intermediate. We were skiing at Skicircus which incorporates three different valleys and two regions of Austria, providing 270 kilometers of slopes between Saalbach Hinterglemm, Saalfelden Leogang, and Fieberbrunn. There were plenty of slopes for me as a beginner, plenty of red slopes for the intermediate guys, and plenty of off-piste (back-country) slopes as well. Everyone was happy that way and the scenery was incredible. There are tons of things you can do other than skiing in mountains like the Alps in Austria. My personal favorite was sledding down the green slopes. You just take the gondola up, perhaps have a schnapps or two at the alm at the top, then sled back down, rinse, repeat. Extra points if you get into a snowball fight partway through. I also snow-shoed through the wintery wilderness too, which I can’t recommend enough. It’s so nice to get a break from the slopes and get some solitude. The tourism office in Saalbach-Hinterglemm actually organizes the hikes for free if you find yourself there. I also can’t leave out apres-ski, which is something Austria is known for – it’s all about German schlager songs with repetitive lyrics that make no sense and a big crowd of people dancing and singing while drinking warm drinks or cold beers then skiing back down after, or in my case, sliding down on a plastic bag. It was so much fun! If you’re a winter and skiing beginner like I was, then you might want to take a look at my packing list to make sure that you bring along all the things you’ll need for a ski trip. Even though I feared the cold and winter, and especially skiing, prior to giving it a try, I’m so happy to report that I have a new addiction to the sport and you’ll see a lot more coverage of it from me. If I can do it, you can too. If you have any tips to add for skiing for beginners, add them in the comments! *In the spirit of full disclosure, this post was brought to you in collaboration with the Skicircus in Austria. That said, these tips ring true regardless. Happy skiing!  I’ve had pleeenty of winter experience (despite currently living in Las Vegas lol) but I’ve never skied. I’d love to try though! If you can try it at 29 then it’s certainly not a lost cause for me to give it a go in the next couple years. The way you’ve become interested in skiing seems like how a lot of bloggers get into diving; is skiing something you want to keep doing? I’d love to read about different places all over the world to ski! Most definitely. I love diving as well but that was something I started doing way before blogging. I like active, outdoor adventures in general so it was a natural fit to try skiing. I think next on my list should be surfing. It’s shameful that I grew up next to the Pacific and have never even tried!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/saalbach-austria-ski-review/,Skicircus: Austria’s Most Laid-Back Ski Resort,Austria,"Each winter, powder hounds start thinking about which slopes they should hit. As a first-timer, I didn’t really know what makes one ski area better than the other. When I asked a friend what makes skiing in Austria unique when compared to other Alpine ski areas, he said without hesitation, “It’s cozy.” As I looked around the dining room that evening in Lengau, warm, framed by light-colored wood and pretty white tablecloths, plus the steaming plate of delicious braised beef and spätzle (a type of short and wide egg noodle) in front of me, I understood exactly what he meant. The waitress came by, dressed in a traditional dirndl, and kindly offered us another glass of wine in a singsong voice. It wasn’t an overly crowded food hall, it felt like I was sitting in someone’s dining room at home as a guest. The hotels are mainly small and family-run in Alpine Austria. The food is from local, happy animals that graze in the green mountains when they’re not layered with snow, and the locals are incredibly friendly and welcoming. It’s an easy place to love and a difficult place to leave. The thing about these little villages in Austria is you always feel thought of. I caught myself continuously thinking to myself, “wow, they’ve really considered every little detail.” It often feels more like you’re staying in someone’s home, or the very place the owner would want to hang out, when you lay your head to sleep each night. I’d visited Austria over the summer and fell in love with the gorgeous Alps. I had no idea that they looked even more stunning and were more fun to visit in the winter, though. There must be hundreds of ski resorts in Austria so it’s not exactly easy to make a choice when it comes to picking which one to visit. Skicircus seemed like a good choice because of the huge variety it offers. Skicircus just became Austria’s largest ski resort a couple of months ago. A new gondola joined two regions of Austria — Salzburg and Tirol — widening the offering to 270km of slopes split amongst three different ski areas – Saalbach Hinterglemm, Saalfelden Leogang, and Fieberbrunn. Now, normally going to the biggest resort would turn me off. I’d be scared it would be too crowded or gimmicky. In reality, more slopes means more space for everyone and tons of options regardless of skill level (I’m a newbie). The small villages have a warm and welcoming appeal, and rather than feeling like a number which I’m told is more common elsewhere in the Alps, you feel more like a guest. Just because the ski resort is larger doesn’t mean that it’s suddenly swarming with people in every village. Each has retained its own charm and individuality, at least that was the case when I was there. Hinterglemm is the largest with the widest variety of slopes, Fieberbrunn is better known for ‘off piste’ or back-country slopes, and Leogang is famous for the gorgeous mountains all around and more blue-level slopes for beginners like me. The lift tickets are also much cheaper than what I’m used to in North America, where they usually run at $100 or so for a day. In Saalbach, it was just €51 for access to hundreds of kilometers of slopes. Plus, I’m sorry to say it, but I find the Alps to be more beautiful than the Rockies, and the food is better, too. I’ve Never spent this much time consecutively in the snow, but it was gorgeous and the perfect conditions for skiing day in and day out. I had nine full days of snowfall while in the Skicircus. That meant that I had fresh powder to ski on every single day. We also got sunshine intermittently as well, so there were a few days with absolutely gorgeous scenery to look at while gliding down the mountains. To get a better idea of the daily activities and what the slopes were like, my buddy Steve did a great job documenting it for the YouTube:  Thanks to my awesome experiences there, I got addicted to skiing and even did it again a week later in Finnish Lapland. Expect to see more about the sport on this blog! Have you been to Saalbach? Let me know in the comments! *In the spirit of full disclosure, this post was brought to you in conjunction with Skicircus, however I never write positively about something I didn’t love. Your trust always comes first. I genuinely nearly cried a little when I left and wish I could have stayed all season.  Seems like a great place to spend Winter! I do most of my skiing in Scandinavia, but have been dying to visit the Alps! 🙂 You’d be hard pressed to find a more beautiful ski spot. I love the Alps! Ahh I want to go skiing in the Alps! I’ve never skied, though I got close once in Zakopane, Poland, and I’ve been dying to try it out ever since. Austria looks just gorgeous, I can see why you didn’t want to leave! Aaah i love your text! I live near the skicircus and everything you wrote is so true. I often forget how beautiful our area is. Thank you for reminding me that my home is such a good place to be!! 😀 So glad that you like the post, Sandra! I love it when locals read and enjoy my posts 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-do-in-aruba/,20 Outdoorsy Things to Do in Aruba,Aruba,"I’m not much of a go-shopping-eat-at-this-restaurant kind of traveler. I want to swim, I want to get dirty, I want to look around and see nobody else and feel satisfied that I made it off the beaten path. On Aruba, despite it being a small island, it’s actually quite easy to get away from the crowds and have an adventurous and outdoorsy trip. This island has a lot to offer – great diving and snorkeling, including wrecks, amazing beaches, wind perfect for kiting, surfing waves, caves, natural rock pools, rock arches, rolling hills covered in cacti, and lots of off roading. I’ve thrown in a few more accessible and touristy favorites as well, just for good measure. You will need: maps.me offline maps for Aruba, ideally a Jeep or similar, and a love for the outdoors. Ready? Let’s do this! Not far from the high-rise hotels of Palm Beach, you’ll find Eagle Beach with white sand and perfect positioning for the sunset each night. Watch as boats sail by, or consider staying at a boutique hotel on this beach for a slightly quieter experience. Baby Beach, and the beaches that border it on either side, are some of the nicest, least crowded white sand beaches on Aruba. They’re also a favorite for snorkeling, swimming, and basking in the sun. You’ll find this one on the south side of the island. More south on the eastern side of the island, the surf is bigger and the wind is stronger, which makes it perfect for kite boarding. If you’re a kiter then this is the perfect spot. Since it’s high up on the island, the California Lighthouse is the perfect place to catch the sunset. It’s not far from Palm Beach, where most of the hotels are, so it’s easy to stop by after a long day at the beach and watch as the sun dips below the horizon. It’s also a good spot for stargazing and astrophotography if you’re into it. You can’t go to Aruba without seeing Arikok National Park! It’s the rugged, enchanting side of the island which ended up being my favorite during my time in Aruba. Different tours will take you to different places, like the Ayo Rock Formations or the caves listed below, but in general they all take you up and down rocky roads in a Jeep with a driver or self driving an ATV in a group with a guide. You can pick your tour depending on what you’d most like to see, choosing from more of the options listed in this article. I went with ABC tours and had a great time. The diving is pretty good in Aruba. It’s not the hands down best in the world, but for such an easy variety of dive sites that you can access in water that isn’t that deep and not too far from shore, I was pretty impressed! You can ask your hotel or one of the many dive operators along Palm Beach for a morning or afternoon dive. It only takes a few hours and in my opinion, is worth the time and money if you’re a diver. If you’re not a diver, or even if you are, there’s a wreck that almost every boat cruise stops by that’s incredibly shallow compared to most wrecks. You can either freedive down to it, or swim above it with the possibility of seeing much of the wreck on a day with clear water. After the Natural Bridge collapsed years ago, this is now the largest natural bridge on Aruba. It’s on a remote road that you’ll need either a 4×4 or an ATV tour to get to, but if you want to see the more adventurous side of Aruba that fewer tourists see, I recommend taking a drive all along the east coast, including this spot. I did a solo drive here and absolutely loved it. You can rent a 4×4 Jeep at the airport when you arrive. Bonus: If you’re a surfer, there’s a popular surf spot nearby. Just be careful, the waves crash right up on rocks along this part of the coast. Yet another natural bridge, this one has three arches and is a bit less remote to reach, though you’ll still need a 4×4. I headed here for the sunrise thinking I’d get it rising right in front of the bridge, but it was actually a bit more to my right. That said, heading there first thing in the morning meant I got it all to myself! Some of the Jeep tours in Arikok National Park will stop by this cave, which is even cooler than I expected! If you get there at the right time of day you can see light beams coming down as well. Aim for midday to see this. You can either self-drive with a 4×4 or book a tour that takes you here as well as the next stop, the Natural Pool. This was easily my favorite thing to do in Aruba. The rocks that perfectly form this natural pool, and a natural ‘jacuzzi’ to the right of my right shoulder in the photo above, make for a perfect swimming area. It can get a little crazy with the waves crashing over the side, but there’s a park guide nearby who closes the pool if the waves get too rough. If you can, try to go on a calmer day. Earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon are good times to avoid crowds. In the spirit of full disclosure, flamingos are not native to Aruba and these guys are here more as a spectacle than anything. You can buy food to feed to them and take photos with them, though it does come with a $120 price tag to visit Renaissance Island unless you’re staying at the hotel, in which case it’s free. The rest of the island is lovely as well, but there’s not much shade. You can find out more about how to visit here. I was surprised to see cacti all over Aruba the first time I went. I had no idea that it was more of a desert island than the humid Caribbean islands I’m used to seeing. There are plenty of trails in Arikok for exploring to get up and close with them. You’ll also pass plenty when driving along the east coast. If you do end up hiking, keep in mind that there’s little to no shade, and you’ll want to bring lots of water with you. Opt for the early morning hours to avoid peak day heat. Here are some great hiking options. If you’re up for a self-drive adventure, I can’t recommend renting a Jeep and driving along the north and east coast enough. I took my Jeep out on a 4×4 road every day that I was on Aruba, and loved the freedom it gave me. It also allows you to see parts of the island that others don’t see. You can compare options here. For a dreamy beachy horseback ride, Dos Playa in Arikok is the spot. You’ll find this near the Natural Pool where the horses hang out. Personally I’m pretty scared of horses (I know it’s silly that I’ll solo hitchhike before I’ll get on a horse but we all have our weird fears). If you enjoy horseback riding, though, you can book it here. Just up the coast from Palm Beach, Tres Trapi is a swimming spot with three steps carved into the rock that lead to incredibly clear water. There’s a tiny sea cave near the steps, and it’s another favorite snorkeling spot on the island. You can either drive yourself there or potentially walk along the sand from Palm Beach. If you’re a surfer, head to the east coast’s Andicuri Beach for the best surfing on Aruba. I didn’t test this out myself and can’t speak to how great the surf is, but to access it you’ll want a vehicle that you can take through sand. Alternatively, check surfline for the best surf of the day. In some cases, you’ll be ok to get there with a standard vehicle. If you don’t have a board in tow or want to learn, check out the Aruba Surf and Paddleboard school. Mangel Halto is one of the best spots for sunset, and for a secluded beach amongst the mangroves. It takes a while to get there from Palm Beach or Eagle Beach, so leave yourself at least an hour before sunset if you want to be able to enjoy it without getting stuck in too much traffic. Bring along a mask and snorkel, too! If you’re into being on the water and love boats, then I highly recommend a sunset sail, departing from Palm Beach. They’ll take you to the shipwreck and provide evening beverages while going along the coast as the sun goes down. It’s a fantastic evening activity. You can book here. Though I didn’t try this, I was pretty curious about the skydiving on Aruba. It must look pretty insane to dive down to such a small island from the air. You can find out more and book here. While those are some of the best outdoorsy things to do on Aruba, there are also colorful buildings, famous restaurants, and even a donkey sanctuary. Now that I’ve had the pleasure of exploring Aruba twice, I’m pretty impressed by how much there is to do for such a small island, particularly if you’re into 4×4 driving and rugged coastline. *Some links in this post are affiliate links. Any booking you make through this site supports us at no extra cost to you. This post was brought to you in collaboration with Aruba Tourism Authority. All reviews and thoughts are genuine.   You’re killing me with all this Aruba content. The photos are so gorgeous. I’m literally looking at flights from Los Angeles right now. I also just realized that flights are surprisingly affordable. Thanks for sharing this amazing trip with us. That’s fantastic! I hope you go check it out then! Looks great! Haven’t been to Aruba, but sailed to Bonaire and Curacao back in 2008 – gorgeous islands. One of the best experiences of my life, has been swimming with flamingos, is something I never thought would happen. We’ve been going to Aruba for 15 years and have visited and done a lot of what you showed.  I’m so impressed with your pics and writing.  You totally captured the true essence of Aruba.  This needs to be shared with the folks who visit just sit under their palapa each year at their timeshares…. get out and explore this island!  Fantastic, Kristin! Aw thanks I’m so glad you liked it! I guess the people parked at the resort means fewer crowds at these special places that are harder to get to 😉    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-do-in-aruba-itinerary/,The Ultimate Adventurous 5-Day Aruba Itinerary,Aruba,"As I wrap up my second visit to Aruba I can’t help but feel amazed by how adventurous this island can be and by how much variety there is for such a small place. I got to see all kinds of landscape, have daily experiences that were all totally different, and get a tan in the process! Many who visit Aruba are happy to lounge on a beach chair all day and don’t need much adventure to enjoy their vacay. While there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, I just can’t do it for long and need to be either walking on the beach, swimming, or doing something active. If you’re like me, the following itinerary will get you out and exploring the adventurous and outdoorsy side of Aruba, with some beach time included, of course! Aruba has tons of beaches – either long stretches of sand or hidden behind rocky coves and inlets. I stumbled upon them constantly during my exploration, though some are much friendlier for swimmers than others. The following are the best ones for snorkeling, swimming, and general chilling: Palm Beach is the most touristy beach with high-rise hotels and lots of restaurants and water activities.  When you see the white sand and the clear baby blue water, it’s clear why. You can standup paddleboard, parasail, and of course swim. You’ll find people all along the sand offering activities, and most hotels also offer a free mask and snorkel. Chances are you’ll be staying on either this beach or the next one, so check it out, especially at sunset. Baby Beach on the southern tip of the island is known for having great snorkeling and white sand. It also has fewer tourists than the beaches up north. I was a big fan of this one! Eagle Beach is slightly less crowded than Palm Beach and is famous for its perfect white sand and baby blue water. It is west facing and therefore perfect for sunset. North of Palm Beach, you’ll find Malmok Beach and a few other great swimming and snorkeling spots. The picture above is at Tres Trapi, which are three stairs carved into the volcanic rock that lead to this lovely blue water. Many of the snorkeling tours stop here, so you can plan on seeing sea birds all around and fish under the water if you bring your mask and snorkel. In the afternoon, I recommend heading to the California Lighthouse on the northern tip of the island for sunset. You get a fantastic view, and the lighthouse is a great photo spot as well. I also enjoyed driving around the coastal roads nearby where you can find sand dunes, beautiful rocky outcroppings, and a more rugged Aruba experience. If you stick to the trail that borders the water, a normal car is probably OK as the road is mostly dirt with a few rocks and potholes, but a 4×4 will give you ultimate flexibility. If you have a 4×4 and feel like continuing onwards, I had a lot of fun on the rocky road from the lighthouse to the Wariruri rock bridge. Following the collapse of the Natural Bridge in 2005, this is now the largest natural bridge in Aruba. The road is rough, but to me that’s a lot of fun, and you can plan on having it almost all to yourself. I made plenty of stops along the way and truly enjoyed this solo adventure. You can’t go to Aruba without visiting the Arikok National Park! This is where you can find the famous caves, the natural pool, and a much more rugged stretch of coast. You absolutely do need a 4×4 for this trip, which you can self drive, although most people join either a Jeep tour or an ATV tour that takes you to the following spots:  The caves and the stairway outside of them were my first introduction to the rugged side of Aruba when I visited a year and a half ago and I was absolutely delighted! The ride there is an adventure in itself, along bumpy terrain and through cacti forests. I had so much fun getting there that the cave was the cherry on top.  Depending on time of day, you can get some lovely light beams coming through the opening in the cave’s ceiling. The highlight to Arikok National Park is undoubtedly this beautiful rocky pool that forms an almost perfect circle. The waves crash over the sides and there’s even a ‘natural jacuzzi’ slightly above, which you can see to my right in this photo. This was my favorite thing in Aruba – it was so magical it didn’t seem real. Dos Playa is a rare beach on the east coast that can be tame enough to swim in. It’s one of the larger ones in the area and is popular for sunset horseback rides, too. I went with ABC tours to book this adventure. They have both big truck and ATV options. Some are full-day and some just take you to the natural pool. Choose your own adventure here. After a few days exploring Aruba’s more rugged and natural side, I feel we have to talk about Renaissance Island. This man-made flamingo island is undoubtedly beautiful. It’s also where you can take pictures with the famous flamingos on the beach and lounge in hammocks in the sun. There are several beach huts that you can rent to hang out in for the day, and you can eat and drink on the island as well. There are a few things to know about the island, such as the entrance fee, the best way to get in, and figuring out how to get shade while you’re there. I have an entire post dedicated to Flamingo Island with all of the info here. On day four I recommend picking one or two of the adventurous activities available on the island and then a nice relaxing sunset on the water or on a beach nearby. The following are some great options: The water is clear and there are plenty of fish in Aruba. There is also a shallow wreck, which is a rare find in the diving world. All of these are great reasons to jump in and see what’s up unda da sea. I did a morning dive last time I was on Aruba and was impressed by the corals and fish. If you are used to Southeast Asia, don’t expect the same that you would find in Sipadan or Raja Ampat, but still, for those who love diving this is a great spot to get under the water. You can rent stand up paddle boards all along Palm Beach where the water is calm enough to head out for an hour or two of activity. The nice thing about Aruba is it’s almost always breezy so standup paddleboarding is quite pleasant in Aruba. Be sure to check out the partially submerged wreck around Malmok Beach for a unique experience! If you’re not into diving, you can still snorkel around a wreck near the California Lighthouse. Multiple boat trips depart at different times per day to take you out there. I did a cruise in the morning and an evening sunset cruise last time I was here, both of which went to the wreck. I would give the edge to the sunset cruise as there were fewer people in the water then, but being able to get on a boat and get out on the water is a must no matter what time you choose to do it in Aruba. You can book it here. Let me just start by saying I’m not sure what the proper name of this place is – I’ve heard ‘tripod bridge’ and I see it as the ‘trinity bridge’ on maps.me, but either way this bridge is neato. It’s a set of three sea bridges that look gorgeous in the early morning hours when the sun comes up and illuminates the rocks. You’ll need a 4×4 to get here but if you have one handy from the other activities, be sure to get there in the early morning, before the tour groups arrive. You can explore the cacti, Ayo Rock Formation, and rugged coastline along this part of the island in the AM, or just chill out – I know this has been a pretty packed itinerary. For the afternoon/evening, I highly recommend heading to Mangel Halto for a secluded beach, lovely mangroves, and perfect positioning for the sunset. From there you’re close to Zeerover, a famous seafood restaurant. Aruba has many high-rise hotels and all inclusive resorts, but also many smaller boutique hotels that can be a much more peaceful experience. I stayed in the Boardwalk Small Hotel and loved the intimate feel of it. It’s located just behind the Ritz Carlton on Palm Beach and has an area on the sand to chill on and a lovely pool, but without the huge and impersonal feel of a giant resort. I had a huge room too, with a separate living area, full kitchen, and a huge closet. I could easily have just moved right in! I also love that it’s owned by two sisters. Girl power! You can see casita options and book here. Although many of the options I mentioned above are made easier or are only possible with a 4×4 rental (all the major car rental companies are available at the airport – but do book ahead of time), you can also join a tour to see almost everything listed above. If you have specific things from this itinerary you want to see, ask the guys at ABC which tour would be the best one. I found driving in Aruba to be pretty easy and straightforward. There are lots of roundabouts, and sometimes people will turn out of roads right in front of you, so just drive defensively and don’t go too fast. Overall it was fine and fairly stress-free. I also highly recommend downloading the Aruba map on maps.me offline maps. It’s free, it worked great, and I never got lost with it. Happy travels in Aruba! I hope this itinerary helps you to see a more adventurous side of the island and to fall in love with it as much as I did. It’s the perfect place to unwind – just small enough to see a ton of it in just a few days, but just big enough to keep you wanting to come back to see more. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Aruba Tourism Authority, however this itinerary was entirely crafted and created by yours truly.  Your itinerary looks super fun, you’ve got me looking at flights for 2019! I really appreciate your Aruba itinerary Kristin. I can’t stop thinking of the beach… Hey long time no talk! I hope you get to visit and enjoy it! Single woman traveling to Aruba no families, no fancy hotels, just snorkeling and paddleboarding I’m planning a 7 dat trip and just wanted to see how others planned their. Most tours are in the daytime or do similar places so was looking for ideas in the afternoons. Looms like mostly beaches and rare secluded spots. I can do that. Thanks Do you have to have international drivers license to drive in Aruba They did not ask me for one. They might if your license is not in English or Dutch.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/flamingo-island-aruba/,"How to Visit Flamingo Island, Aruba",Aruba,"When I was planning my trip to Aruba I put out the call to my friends to see who had been there and what could not be missed. One of them mentioned that there are flamingos on the beach in Aruba and I was beyond ecstatic. I could just picture it: Chilling with a bunch of pink compadres in that beautiful blue Caribbean water? It’s a photographer’s dream! Chillin with the homies. They look a little pink, must be getting too much sun! (?: @whatspaigewearing) A post shared by  Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Apr 25, 2017 at 9:38am PDT  But when I arrived in Aruba it turned out that there are not scores of flamingos roaming around all over the beaches, they are in just one spot – a private island owned by a hotel. Renaissance Island is a private island connected to the Renaissance Hotel, which is located in the main shopping area of Aruba. It’s somewhat close to the cruise port and the airport in Oranjestad. In order to access the island you have two options: You can stay at the Renaissance Hotel since it’s included as a hotel perk, or you can pay a $99 fee for access to the island for the day. It includes the boat transfer, lunch on the island, and a drink. There is, however, a caveat. The hotel sells a maximum of 30 passes to the island per day to non-guests, so it is possible that you could arrive at the hotel and find that they are sold out. That said, the hotel can cost as low as $150 per night and it has a pretty awesome pool as well, so I would suggest staying there for a night if seeing the flamingos is really high on your list of must-dos in Aruba. You can also call the hotel ahead of time to make sure they still have passes before you head over. If they turn you down at the lobby, remind them that you called ahead, and they still may sell you a ticket – it worked for a couple of friends of mine. The island itself is absolutely stunning. You access it from a tiny little porch area next to the Starbucks on the floor below the lobby in the Renaissance Hotel. The speed boat runs every 10 to 15 minutes and, reminiscent of Las Vegas, takes you under the lobby of the hotel before heading right out into the ocean. After about 15 minutes you arrive at the island which has been carefully crafted into a dreamy Caribbean getaway with hammocks, swaying palm trees, and of course, a little group of flamingos. The island is divided into two sides – the adult side and the family side. The flamingos are actually located on the adult side, so do expect to see some children coming over to see them from time to time.  There are also little huts on one of the rocky peninsulas that you can rent out for the day, which we did since my time in Aruba fell on the birthday of two of my friends and I. So we had to, right? Each one has a hammock over the water, and the end one that we rented had a swing as well. Sadly, drinks are not included so this is purely for the privilege of having a private area on the island. I had a wonderful time on the island, all in all. I thought it was absolutely beautiful, relaxed, and of course I enjoyed a little romp in the warm water with the flamingos. That said, I think that $99 is really steep. There are only about seven flamingos and everybody wants to take photos with them. They are not native to the island, so I think of it more as a petting zoo than anything else. You should also know that the only shade on the island is palm trees unless you seek refuge in the bar area or are one of the lucky few who rent a Bungalow. For me, that means I could not hang out on the island all day because I don’t want to be in the sun for that many hours. I do think that the Renaissance Aruba Resort is a lovely option, however the only beach they have is the Renaissance Island, so there’s no strolling out of your room and right onto the sand like if you stayed in Palm Beach, which I personally did. The best of both worlds, if you have the time, would be to spend a couple days at the Renaissance and a few days elsewhere that has more of a beachy feel. Thanks, Aruba, for giving me a taste of the Caribbean. It definitely left me wanting more! Thank you for sharing your honest opinion Kristin! The flamingo beach was on my bucket list for this year but I had no idea there were only 7 flamingos and that it’s more like a petting zoo! I may have to reconsider ?  Thank you for sharing your adventures with us! Have a lovely day ? It was still cool but yeah, it’s a tourist attraction rather than a naturally occurring thing… Kids only allowed on private island until 10 AM, tops optional after that. Tops optional? Didn’t see that, but cool! Looks pretty rad, I want some pink compadres in my life! That resort is pretty damn beautiful too. I didn’t even hear about it when I went to Aruba! What an incredible experience! The photos are beautiful, you really made the most of this wonderful place. I had a similar experience swimming in the sea with animals in the Bahamas, but in my case they weren’t so exotic…they were pigs! The Exuma pigs looked very content wading around the crystal clear blue ocean and trotting along the white sand. An unforgettable experience, much like your own! We are going to be staying at the riu properties in palm beach. How do we sign up from another hotel to get to the flamingos I personally want to see them and get pics. Do we sign up at the riu or how does this work ? You have to show up and pay for the ferry, or if you’re staying at another one of their properties maybe contact them and see if they’ll include it for you. Thank you very much! This resort and private island are now owned by the Poarch Band of Creek Indians out of Alabama.  I am headed down in March.  Hoping for an amazing vacation. Thanks for the update! Is it still named Renaissance? Hey Kristin, the answer is yes I believe. They plan on keeping the same brand and name for all of their new acquisitions of casinos and resorts according to this site which I find reliable. Hope this helps! https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wind-creek-hospitality-purchases-caribbean-casino-resorts-300539321.htmlBTW this group of Native Americans-Creeks have a unique history in that they were not removed during incidents like “The Trail of Tears”, so they have remained in or near the home the whole time and have their own government, etc.  The site gives more details about them beyond my scant historical knowledge! Thank you for sharing your experience. I’m surprising my husband with a trip to Aruba for his birthday in May and I had wanted to do a day trip to Flamingo Island. I will now be rethinking it because of the lack of shade, cost and the fact that there really aren’t many Flamingos. That being said, it does look like a beautiful island. I think it’s still pretty cool, but the natural pool is an amazing day excursion too! This was extremely helpful and a huge time saver I will save this bucket list items for when I can stay on the island when not on a cruise. Awesome! Enjoy. Thank you Kristin for the input.  I’m traveling to Aruba 22 May 2018.  Flaminigos are my favourite birds!!!!!!    I’m taking my daughter with me.  Yes, it’s a steep price, but, the sun won’t bother us.  We are from St. Croix!!!!!!   I are seriously considering this, even though I will pay for it, but, I don’t know when I will ever visit Aruba again.   ANy other places you suggest?  Restaurants/attractions??? Yes take the day trip to the Natural Pool! They bring you to cave as well. It was my favorite thing I did besides the flamingoes. The diving is decent too. Kristen- any chance you recall the cost associated with renting a hut for the day? I think it was several hundred. Hi Kristin, I am in Aruba right now staying at one of the Riu resorts which I know is very close to the shopping mall area. Today is our second last day here and we have still yet to visit the island! Do you by any chance remember what time the tickets go on sale? You’ll want to give them a call and get there as early in the day as you can. If you show up and they say they’re sold out you can try saying you talked to them on the phone and they said they had space. That actually worked for me last time! We will be visiting in Dec for a yoga retreat. But our flights worked out better to stay 1 extra night. So I’m considering staying at this hotel and seeing the flamingos.  Is there a certain time they take everyone out to the island and what time do they typically get back to the hotel? The boat runs all the time, all day, so you can go and come back whenever! Hi Kristen,  I’m planning on visiting Renaissance island in late November! Just having a little hard time finding out how the transportation would work going from Aruba (AUA airport) to Renaissance island? Did you have any trouble with transportation or is that something the Renaissance resort provides? Thanks! I’d contact the resort! I took a bus that drops people off at various resorts, so that’s an option too. Thank you for the information. My husband and I will be taking a cruise in April of 2019. I would love to see flamingo island. There is actually a third way to visit the island.  Their spa guests can stay for the day. My Boyfriend and I have an oceanside couple’s massage booked for Oct 16, 2018.  It will be our first time there.  Cant wait! Thanks for the intel that’s awesome! Better value too. My family we will stay in other hotel but I want to see the flamingoes too, is it the price $99 is only for one person ? or how it works ? thank you $99 per person, yes. Hi Kristin this is a very nice review..!! I’m actually planning a weekend getaway to Aruba.. any recommendations on what to do since we only have 2 days there..?? You could do this one and Arikok National Park. That would be a pretty sick trip! Hi this is most helpful, we have booked a night in the renaissance resort and casino Marriott.  Could you confirm that this is the right hotel to be able to spend the day at the flamingo beach. Thank you These are two separate bookings right? It’s the renaissance hotel that I linked to in the post.  Thanks for sharing your experience! I think the same as you in relation to the price of the entrance, it is true that swimming with flamingos is something quite unusual but they are very few besides that everyone wants to be close to them! I usually stay at the nearby beaches like Eagle Beach, it’s very beautiful, it’s also worth seeing the California lighthouse, do not you think? Does someone go behind the flamingos and pick up their poo?  Just curious Haven’t seen it. Be careful my husband had a heart attack and died. If they had a defibrillator on the island he may still be alive and we had to wait for boat to take us from island back to mainland. Nightmare I’m so sorry that happened to you! That sounds like a terrible experience. I wish you all the best with your healing. We are there now and sadly an older man had a heart attack and died yesterday on the island but they do now have a defibrillator which was used. can I book excursion on cruise ship to island I have no idea but probably not How much was it to rent a hut? if you stay at the hotel, is the hut included? I booked two nights to stay there out of my week because i don’t want to deal with the competition of getting a boat ticket, but hopefully that means it doesn’t get too crowded, what did you think of the crowd? Great article! You would have to still pay for the hut. I’m honestly not sure what they charge now. Best to ask them directly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/africa-packing-list/,"An Easy, Fashionable Africa Packing List",Botswana,"“What in the world do people pack when they go to Africa? Where do I start? What is essential and what should I leave behind?” This was my question before I went to Africa for the first time, heading to South Africa with a backpack full of denim shorts and tank tops, kind of clueless about what was and wasn’t cool to wear there. It turned out that in most of Southern Africa, people dressed just like where I’m from in California – it’s all about fashion, feeling comfortable, and keeping it laid back. In Africa, you’ll see all kinds of interesting fashion decisions. I have to laugh to myself a little bit each time I travel there and see foreigners like me decked out head to toe in beige and olive green safari gear. They’ve got the vests, the hats, and the pants that zip off at the knee. Honestly, what do they think they’re going to need that for? You’re not even allowed to get out of the safari vehicles when in the wildlife areas, because of, you know, lions, hippos, and buffalo. While you can most certainly make the safari chic work for you by opting for the more stylish and modern cousins of the original, it’s also totally fine to go for the same cute clothes you’d wear at home, while keeping a few general rules in mind:  Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Africa here: Also, if you’ll be traveling to Cape Town, leave a little room in your bag to do some shopping. The local designers there are talented and have access to super cool fabrics, and the exchange rate, at least right now, is in your favor if on the Euro, Dollar, and GBP. I got custom shoes and these adorable shorts for way less than I would have at home. Each time I travel to Africa, I tend to bring my Pacsafe 55L backpack with me. It’s lined with Exomesh which makes it slash-proof, the zippers lock, and it has RFID-blocking technology so that theives can’t ‘bump into’ me and scan my credit card and passport info. I also bring along a smaller cross-body purse and wallet that has space for multiple currencies. They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well. I make myself the least attractive target that way. I also lock up my belongings in my Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa. Sadly, it’s often pressure from local mobsters on the people working in the hotels, or desperation given how low the wages are in most of Africa. There are a few more absolute essentials that you should bring from home that you will struggle to find in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and major cities like Nairobi, Kigali, and Lusaka: If you’re camping, I highly recommend the following: Insurance, immunizations, and meds: Travel insurance is an important addition to this packing list because it keeps you covered in the worst case scenario, which is being flown to a country where you can get the proper care you need. I use World Nomads since their explorer option also covers adventurous activities like hiking and scuba diving. You might be surprised to find that in major cities in Africa, like Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi, and surely plenty of others, immunizations and anti-malarial pills are way cheaper and often don’t require a prescription. I always buy my anti-malarials on the ground (though it’s important to take them before you will be exposed, so plan ahead). Keep in mind, Africa is huge, and this list is meant for those traveling through the southern and eastern countries with some suggestions for the far north as well. If you’re just sticking to South Africa, modesty isn’t a big concern and staples like hair products and sunscreen are easy to replace, but as you head more north and east, expect things to get a lot more lean and basic and you may be shocked at how difficult it is to find things that are totally common back home. Plan ahead and you’ll have a blast! Enjoy the beautiful adventure in comfort and style, and not in head-to-toe beige safari gear! *Some of these links are affiliate links and BMTM sponsors. Anything you purchase helps to support this site at absolutely no additional cost to you. Much love!  Everything on this list is SO cute. I’m so not with it when it comes to packing right. haha. I ALWAYS pack 50% OK stuff and the other half is “wtf was I thinking.” I’m getting better though! I really like to safari shorts for anytime actually! And all the unicorn things… I need unicorn things! haha. I wish I was a hat person but my hair is too big. lol. Thanks for this info, Kristin! I used to pack pretty badly too but I’m getting a lot better now. Lots of trial and error! I love hats because that African sun is intense! Hi Kristin,Thanks as always for the amazing posts.Did you use the same Ariat hiking boots in Kyrgystan?Thank you! I did not, I used another pair I have from Quechua and they’re not as nice. Lesson learned. Hi Kristin,Saw this post and guess what, I’m currently in Cape Town and want to do a little shopping? Where would you recommend? I found some awesome boutiques with stuff made by local designers on Long Street and in Woodstock. Check out the Neighbourhood Goods Market on Saturdays too. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I’m planning to spend some time in east Africa alone next year – an overland trek, some time in Kigali and maybe Tanzania and a couple of days in Nairobi. This is the part I’m worried about. I’d like to go to the David Sheldrick wildlife trust and maybe a few other places and I want to stay somewhere inexpensive. Are hostels a safe place to stay in Nairobi for a single woman traveler? I think you mentioned them but they sound a bit sketchy….probably the stereotypical Nairobi fear that you spoke of. Where do you stay in Nairobi if just for a few days.Thank you,Gina I haven’t actually been to Nairobi but have been to other big cities in the area like Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha, Kigali, and Kampala. I would just only walk during the day, and take cabs longer distances or at night. Ask at your hostel where is safe to go and where isn’t. Most hostels are locked with guards and plenty of other travelers, so I’ve felt OK in them. Have fun! Hi. I’m planning on a three months trip whatever I have time for of Malawi, Mosambik, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. I consider going alone as a female 27 years old and will use my experience of solo travels through south east asia and tanzania with a girl friend of mine. I want to travel with hand luggage, but I guess that is not a good idea if I will have to cary a bunch of sun screen to some places!? I am typical scandinavian with light skin and blonde hair. Also I wonder what is the easiest way to get from country to country? Where should I begin my trip? Thank you 🙂 Sunscreen is a good idea, especially since it’s hard to find once you reach East Africa, apart from in big cities. You could just bring several small bottles. As much as I hate suggesting so many small plastic items, it’ll help you go carry on only. It makes sense to fly into South Africa and go through Namibia to Botswana and work your way up and east. Local buses really suck, but they work. You can also sometimes take trains and long distance buses, or join an overland tour. This packing list is helpful. I am off for Cape Town in April. Thanks Have fun! What did you pack for an adapter so you could use hair tools?  I would like to bring a curling iron or straightener but most adapters I see say not to use hair tools with them! I don’t own any curling irons or straighteners! Sorry I can’t help more. HI Kristin thank you for writing everything in detail. I checked overland tours from Kenya to Tanzania nd they are super expensive, starting g from 1500 USD. Flight is even more expensive. I am travelinging solo, what will be the best way to travel between Zanzibar, Tanzania and Kenya? Not sure how many days that is but if you’re solo that might be the best way to go – something like an Acacia Africa or G adventures is the cheapest. Otherwise you can do public transport but I have to warn you it’s rough in that part of the world. Overcrowded vans with bald tires and massive delays constantly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-wildlife-viewing-in-botswana/,How to Get Wildlife Photos Your Friends Will Love – Go to Botswana,Botswana,"Standing in a garage in East London, South Africa, entertaining myself by looking at the photos on the wall while my road trip buddy, Callum, tested out a motorcycle, I saw it for the first time – the Okavango Delta in Botswana. Repeatedly mentioning that he was a professional photographer, very well known in the area indeed, the owner of the bike (and photos) explained that this was one of the best places in all of southern Africa for wildlife viewing, especially by plane. In all honesty I had never really thought about or heard much about Botswana prior to gazing, mouth ajar from awe, at the glorious photos of the blue and green grasslands, speckled with buffalo and elephants. Even though Namibia was wonderfully warm, and bright, and left a long-lasting and positive impression on me, as far as wildlife viewing goes, Botswana wins out. Here are the places I visited to illustrate why it was so impressive: This is an inland delta and UNESCO World Heritage site with marshes that flood seasonally from March to June (I was there in April). The 250km by 150km area floods with a whopping 11,000,000,000,000 litres of water during this season. Yeah, wow! It’s an enormous area, full of herds of large animals — 200,000 of them to be precise — that are best viewed from above. Most importantly to me, it is home to elephants and hippos – two animals that are more murderous and dangerous to humans than any others, but for some reason look like they’d love a big ol’ hug. The above shots were all taken from a lightweight plane ride over the Delta that lasted for about 45 minutes. It’s a great way to cover a large area and to spot the wildlife given it’s so spread and marshy which makes it difficult to cover on the ground. Viewing from above was great not just for the benefit of not disturbing the animals, but to observe the beauty of the delta as well. Glamping the following evening at Elephant camp was another highlight. After spending two weeks in a tent with a mat and sleeping bag, some nights of which were wet thanks to rainy season, sleeping in a fixed tent with its own en-suite bathrooms was quite a treat. The usual chores each member of my overland safari with Acacia was responsible for were on hold for those nights and the attentive staff cooked all the meals and did all the cleaning. This was a real plus for me because I can be unbelievably lazy about mopping. I’m not the only one, right? I spent the day there trying to master the makoro, which is ridiculously hard to balance on given its light weight. Wading through the delta is a sublime experience. It was so peaceful and so easy to get to an area where nobody else was around. It would also be easy to get lost, so keep that in mind if you find yourself there and don’t meander too far from camp. I loved the friendly staff there, including my makoro captain, Tom, who manned the boat the following morning at sunrise. He took the extra time to point out every snake and frog he saw. We got along well and had lovely conversations, he telling me all about the delta and what it’s like to grow up there.  When I asked if he’s fallen in the river before while rowing he laughed and confirmed that as a child he had several times. It’s a steep learning curve. He even invited me to come back one day to make my own makoro, and extended his contact info. He even included his P.O. box. Don’t ever stop being a G, Tom. Elephant Sands camp ground has one of the only watering holes in the area that isn’t salty and that is important for one reason and one reason only – ridiculous amounts of elephants! This was a way to see wild elephants closer than I ever have before. I got a chance in Sri Lanka, and interacted with rescued domesticated elephants in Thailand, but to see the African elephant this up close was incredible. African elephants are massive. The smallest adult African elephant I saw was about the size of the largest Asian elephant I’ve ever seen, and unlike in Asia, both male and female elephants in Africa have tusks. They use them to scratch bark off of trees, which makes up a big part of their diet. A few other unique traits include two “fingers” on an African elephant’s trunk, an extra pair of ribs, a completely different head shape with no “dent,” concave rather than convex back arch, much less hair than Asian elephants, and no freckles or skin tone variations. Here’s an illustration if you’d like to see how dissimilar they are physically. The only thing separating people from the elephants is a 3-foot (1 meter) high concrete wall which is enough since elephants can’t step very high. They’re almost close enough to touch. I kept thinking to myself, no way this would fly in most other parts of the world. This was particularly evident when I walked out of the girl’s bathroom and heard a loud trumpeting sound from an elephant, warning me that I was too close. You should have seen how quickly I ran! Walking to the bathrooms where there is no wall and roaming about at night can be dangerous, so keep a light of some sort handy and bring along common sense when staying here. Chobe is famous for the sheer number of animals and likelihood of sightings of some of the biggest and most sought-after creatures. It was among my top choices for safaris in the region mainly due to the beautiful surroundings and multitude of huggable elephants and hippos. Chobe has an estimated 50,000 elephants which is the highest concentration in Africa. The riverfront cruise was the best way to take it all in. It allowed us to get close to the animals without stepping into their habitats or line of potential attack. It was also a lovely sunset and the boat drivers didn’t mind that we brought along our own wine (South African Pinotage, of course) to enjoy along the way. Do it yourself: *Some of these activities were provided to me for free or at a discount, however, I never mention anything in a positive light on my blog that I did not love. Your trust always comes first.  The photos are indeed incredible. I think you should check the title of this blog post to how to get wildlife photos than EVERYONE will wanderlust over and over 🙂 Seriously, I have seen so many safari blog posts, but the abundance of animals here is incredible. Nicely done 🙂 Thanks so much, Jenia! It’s really because they were shot in Botswana. The abundance of wildlife there was incredible and this isn’t even 1/10 of the photos I took. It was so cool! Ahh this looks unbelievably amazing! An African safari has always been one of those dreams that seems too far out of reach, too expensive, too good to ever come true, but something like this would be an ideal trip and seems like it’s definitely something worth saving for <3 Some of them are really expensive but luckily this one isn’t bad at all since it’s a camping safari and everyone helps with cleaning and cooking. Totally puts it in reach. How cute are you?!? That top photo is a total winner! I’m a sucker for great wildlife photos, but even better if they also feature a cute human subject, too =) Haha you should have seen the friend who I was forcing to take the photos. I think she about wanted to kill me by the end of the trip. Oh, how I love Botswana. I have such happy memories of the Okavango Delta, although I regret not making it to Chobe too. You look great in the pics as well, of course 😉 Lovely stuff. Thank you, Abi! Can’t do it all, right? The delta is gorgeous. We miss so much being around elephants! Your pictures are stunning! We’ve never seen African elephants, but having spent 2.5 years at Elephant Nature Park in northern Thailand, have spent a bunch of time with Asian elephants. I would really like to see the massive African elephant – love their big ears. 🙂 I didn’t realize you were at ENP for so long! Great place. They really are very different and given your experience you’ll definitely see how massive the differences are! I was blown away by their size. Everything in Africa seems to be more extreme. Great pics and even better trip! One of my dreams is to someday make it to the Okavango delta, hopefully sooner than later. Unfortunately I don’t see it happening anytime soon… It’ll be there. Beautiful spot 🙂 OK, first off, anything with elephants in the wild, I LOVE. Secondly, I was JUST having a conversation yesterday with my friend because I have all these airline miles to use and was trying to think of places to go. I immediately thought of you and your journeys in Africa and now I am pretty sold I want to go to Namibia and Botswana next! You definitely should! You would love seeing African elephants given all your experience with the ones in Thailand! It’s not even that expensive from Europe to get there 🙂 Your photos are amazing. My in-laws went to Botswana several years ago and loved every moment, but we haven’t had an opportunity to get there yet. Hopefully soon! It really is gorgeous. What a great adventure! Wildlife in Africa is just too stunning. This looks absolutely incredible!  I need to go on better wildlife spotting adventures, this is the real deal.  Looks like I’m off to Botswana! Thanks Leah 🙂 Definitely the real deal! Oh wow so nice to see photos of Botswana! My partner Nic used to manage both camps you visited. Couldn’t agree more that a scenic flight is the best way to see the Okavango Delta. Such an incredible place! You did?! Wow! I think I remember a Nick (or at least a mention of one) when I was there last. So cool that you found the post. Really loved the glamping camp in the delta. We all agreed it was phenomenal. Great post and photos! Reminds me of when I backpacked alone for 2 months through Africa in 1985; think it may have been a lot harder then than now. During that trip, I also hitch-hiked for 3 weeks in South Africa with another girl I met in a hostel. Great times but also a couple of scary moments 😉 BTW Cool new site also – looks great! Wow that sounds SO COOL. I hitchhiked in Mozambique but can only imagine what SA was like back then. Not an ideal place to hitch now. Helps me to remember when I explored alone for 2 months through Africa in 1985; think it might have been a great deal harder then than now. Amid that outing, I likewise bummed a ride for 3 weeks in South Africa with another young lady I met in an inn. Awesome times additionally a few unnerving minutes I’m sure it was much different than when I traveled there last year! I would have loved to see it, and the rest of the world for that matter, back then, before ubiquitous internet and cell phones. Wow, what an amazing pictures, Looks very authentic Wildlife, i must say Kristin u deserve a kudos for this amazing Post..Toast to your Adventurous life..!! Great post Kristin!  Even though I am South African and live in South Africa, since visiting Botswana for the first time in June this year, it has become my favourite country on Earth!  In fact I wouldn’t mind living there!  I especially love the fact that there are only about 2 million people!!!    I stayed at three camps:  In the Okavango Delta (Eagle Island), Moremi (Khwai) and Chobe (Savute).  The Delta is an absolute paradise and I cannot wait to go back, but still need to go to the Serengeti.  I agree with you that flying over the Delta is the best way to view this vast and magical place. I loved it so much too. The nature was my favorite there out of every other country I’ve been to yet, and there was definitely stiff competition!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-places-in-southern-africa-for-safari/,Three of the Best Places in Southern Africa for Safari,Botswana,"An African safari is one of those experiences I’ve wanted to have ever since learning that “Z is for zebra” in my early years. Picture books filled my mind with images of what Africa might be like. I imagined a bright, brilliant sun and animals walking around casually, appearing out of nowhere. In the national parks, that was entirely true. It really was the way I’d imagined it as a child. When visitors travel to southern Africa, most visit Kruger National Park in South Africa, hit Cape Town, and leave without seeing much else. While these two spots are famous for a reason, with great tourist infrastructure and options for all levels of adventure and price ranges suitable for all, I wanted to test out some other places that were a bit lesser known, simply to see what else might be out there. Expedia asked me to think about my favorite in South Africa (which was in the Karoo) for those who seek adventure while they travel and like to do things off the tourist trail. Check out that link if you’re interested in my SA suggestion. However, it got me thinking about parks elsewhere that I loved. The following are national parks in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia, all of which had amazing camp grounds nearby, fewer tourists, and impressive animal sightings. If you’re like me and you’ve been wanting to see these animals since childhood like I did, they won’t disappoint: Namibia was good. It was so, so very good. Every time I think back on it, I feel the warm desert heat again and I remember jumping out of planes, climbing sand dunes and boarding back down them, seeing some of the most iconic scenery in the world, gazing at the night sky and finding a full milky way of stars, and I feel so happy to have experienced it. My last stop in Namibia was Etosha National Park, which was incorporated in 1907 and spans 8,600 square miles (22,270 square kilometers). Since the park is partially a massive salt pan and experiences low rainfall – it is a desert, after all — animal spotting is a bit more likely. Taking our own truck through the park, we spotted the normal zebra and springbok that I had seen in South Africa, but then spotted a few things I hadn’t seen there before: two black rhinos, a male lion with a full mane, and a honey badger. That’s right, a honey badger, easily the most badass animal, like, ever. Rhinos are less and less common to see on safari these days due to illegal poaching which has put them at critically endangered numbers. The horns are believed by certain nationalities to promote vitality and power when ground up into a powder and therefore the illegal trade of their horns has put them at severe risk of extinction. Even Prince Harry is highly concerned about it. Etosha is one of the parks where it’s still possible to see them, though we were particularly lucky to see two during our visit. Do it yourself: Rent a vehicle or camper and camp at Okaukuejo camp within the park limits. It has a watering hole that draws in game at night, including rhinos and elephants. Botswana was the first country I spotted the majestic, and huge, African elephant. I had seen them in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia before, and it was entirely true that African elephants are quite a bit bigger and all of them have tusks. Asian elephants are also hairy and freckled, whereas African elephants are entirely grey, hairless, and have massive ears. Cruising along the Zambezi River for a few hours around sunset remains a favorite memory of mine from Botswana. There were more elephants than I could count, along with buffalo, hippos, and crocodiles everywhere. Even though the movie, the Lion King is set in Kenya, it seemed like every animal in the movie was present and that it could easily have been set in Botswana, along with the brilliant setting sun, appearing bigger than I’d ever seen it before. Do it yourself: The closest town to the park is Kasane with lots of camping options. I wasn’t a huge fan of the management at my camp and will therefore not recommend them by name. However I would recommend the company I went on Safari through Namibia, Botswana, Zambia (and beyond) with – here’s my exact booking with Acacia Africa. The South Luangwa National Park was my final safari in Africa and a great way to finish off the string of wildlife sightings. The camp I stayed at regularly had elephants wandering by the pool and hippos bellowing in the waters nearby. It was important that we shine a flashlight and look around before exiting the tents at night – that’s how prevalent the wildlife was! While on safari in the park I finally saw a leopard, a hippo with an open mouth (yawning I think?), and rarest of all, wild dogs. Do it yourself: Camp at the Wildlife Camp, which can organize a safari for you through the park where private vehicles are not permitted. Sunset is the best time to drive through, but bring along glasses and a jacket as the insects at night are plentiful and the vehicle is open-air *Thanks Expedia for inspiring this post, and thanks Southern Africa for being completely mind blowing Beautiful photos, I’m looking foreward to hearing more about Africa! How did you find the pace of the tour, crossing several countries in just over a month? Did you see many people travelling independently in the campgrounds? Do you still recommend travelling that region of Africa with a tourgroup? It was absolutely wonderful and slow paced enough in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia. Sped up a bit once we left Livingstone so that was a bit tough but I think it’s a great way to travel through the area and no, I didn’t see many independent travelers though there were some. This great parks! Love all of them! But have a very special place in my heart for South Luangwa! 🙂 Beautiful photos! I really liked that too and that’s where I saw my leopard! Hi Kristin, we recently went to all these places you just mentioned and had a fabulous time. AMAZING picture of a black rhino. Really. I was just scrolling at first and then stopped, and said, wait that looks like a black because of the mouth and sure enough you said it was. After realizing how difficult it is to get good photos of the black rhinos, stunning shot. Thanks so much, Tiffany! We got so lucky. He was just hanging out for a good 30 minutes, walking around and allowing us to get some seriously amazing shots. Oh, I am SO envious of your honey badger sighting!! In the daytime, too–how’d you manage that?! Darlington (the guide) has good eyes! Wow!!! Doing an African safari has always been one of my biggest dreams, and this only makes me want to up and leave now more than ever. Your photos are beautiful, those sunsets are something to behold for sure! I can’t imagine seeing those animals up close and in the wild. Full disclosure – these were all taken with a telephoto lens so I was still a safe distance away, but close enough to really get a sense of how majestic they are which was awesome. Great article! I LOVE Botswana so much I’m moving there for a couple of years. Chobe is definitely a highlight! P.s I had Darlington as a guide too! Small world 🙂 He’s the best! Botswana really was SO GOOD for wildlife. Amazing photos! Going on a safari is at the top of my bucket list, and I really want to go soon. There are so many amazing places to choose from though, so thank you for narrowing down some of them. When I go I will definitely have to triple check that my camera is working perfectly! public health of NY wants to charge for advice on vaccinations – what is required for Zambia as well as suggested for spending 16 days traveling I can’t answer that for you, however you’ll want at least Hepatitis A and Typhoid so it’s worth it to go. Probably also antimalarials and Yellow Fever as well.     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/churchill-northern-lights/,"Churchill, Manitoba’s Northern Lights Experience",Canada,"If you’ve always dreamed of seeing the Northern Lights, or have seen them already and know how incredible they are, you’ll know it’s a beautiful phenomenon that gets addictive. The more you have seen them, the more you want to again. When the skies are dark and clear, the sun storms put on a dazzling lights display that has enchanted humans for millennia. Are they on your bucket list? Here’s everything to know about seeing them in Churchill, Manitoba, one of the best places in the world to view the Northern Lights:  Given Churchill’s proximity to the auroral oval in the remote subarctic, it has the perfect conditions in the dead of winter to see the lights: Darkness, clarity, and a perfect position affording an excellent opportunity to see them even with a Kp index as low as 1. A higher Kp index is often needed to see the lights in other places which is less frequent (learn about the Kp index, which measures the level of magnetic field disturbance, here). It’s possible to see the lights 300/365 nights per year in Churchill if skies are clear.  The other important thing about lights hunting is that the area has plenty to do in case it’s cloudy. Since nobody can predict nor control the weather, it’s important to make sure you have other reasons to visit a place. Having gone to Churchill twice, these are the things I love about it:  Let’s be honest – there are few more photogenic ways to capture the lights than from the comfort of a yurt for warming up, getting snacks, and jetting out to photograph when the lights dance overhead. It’s so much better than being in town or freezing outside without any shelter.  The best part of the experience, apart from the lights of course, is chatting with the creator, Caleb Ross. He has incredible stories of taking a dog sledding team across several provinces of Canada for four months (who can say they’ve done that?!), plus he teaches you exactly what to do with your camera so that you come out of it with amazing photos. The biggest bonus is the price, at only $129.95 per person (plus 5% tax) per night, in contrast with other tours that charge thousands of dollars. It’s an all-around win-win if you ask me.  He can also plan entire itineraries including accommodation, transport, and activities. Inquire here.  I can’t think of a better way to spend sunrise than jetting across a frozen bay to a shipwreck on a snowmobile with a badass local. Tiffany Spence, a 23-year-old Métis woman who was born and raised in Churchill, started up this company in November and look at how impressive it is! An avid photographer, she knows exactly how to help you get photos of Churchill’s most famous features in the best light.  I’ve had sled dog experiences in Finland before and was delighted to find that these dogs are obsessed with running! They’re so excited and raring to go, you’ll hear a symphony of calls and howls leading up to go time.  Wapusk is a local, Métis-owned operation run by a family that is truly passionate about their dogs. They share stories of races and culture as well as let you interact with and meet the dogs after the mile run as well. It’s a great afternoon activity, especially if you’re a dog person like me! The SeaWalls CHURCHILL murals are visible all around town and in the outskirts of Churchill, painted by talented artists from around the globe to call attention to climate change. I visited each of them when I visited in the summer several years ago and wrote in detail about each here. Though I didn’t get a chance to experience this, Dan’s Diner gives diners the opportunity to have dinner under the lights in a tundra buggy that is normally used for polar bear viewing. This pop-up restaurant is such a creative and unique way to see the lights, and still offers a delicious pay-off if for any reason the aurora doesn’t come out to play Since most Churchill tourism is centralized in the warmer months for beluga whale experiences and especially in the autumn for polar bear experiences, there are far fewer tourists in the winter months. To get to Churchill, you can take a 2-day train out of Winnipeg (that I hear has a car with a glass roof for lights peeping), or take a flight that is, honestly, pricey. That’s why upon arrival I prefer working with smaller, local operators like Nanuk for more affordable activities on the ground.  I stayed at the Aurora Inn, which is one of few options that’s open in the winter, thought it was perfectly cozy, and loved how spacious it was. Though I love Churchill in the summer, it was a real delight to experience it in February at the height of winter. There’s truly nothing like seeing the Northern Lights, and it never gets old. I hope you get a chance to experience them, too.  *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Manitoba. All thoughts on the amazing aurora and Churchill are my own.  I live in Canada and want to go to Churchill so badly! I’ve never seen the Northern Lights, so that’s a huge draw, but mostly I want to go to see the polar bears.I think it would be an amazing winter destination.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/winnipegs-best-things-to-do/,Winnipeg’s 16 Best Things to Do,Canada,"There are some places in the world where I can’t help but be in a good mood. The sun is shining, people are friendly, the food is delicious, and there’s so much to do outside. Having both visited in the peak of summer and winter, Winnipeg has consistently been one of those places for me. An underrated gem in Canada, there’s so much to do in Winnipeg, and it’s impressed me every time with their offerings, no matter the season. The best part is I rarely feel that I have to share it with many people. If you’re visiting Winnipeg, these are some of the best things to do in and around the city: The perfect meeting place in the heart of the city, The Forks is an open dining hall with shops and food vendors selling all kinds of different options from coffee, to Asian fusion, to inventive burgers. But it’s not just the dining hall that’s amazing, it’s the ambience around The Forks. In the wintertime, it’s illuminated with lights and 150 ice-skating trails. There’s also an international warming hut competition, which is really more about artists and architects making statements and modern art.  For many, Canada is synonymous with hockey, and I for one had to experience the sport in a place with truly passionate fans. What better way than to attend a Jets game? I was not disappointed when the fan cams were hilarious, the vibes were great, and the Jets won! As an avid fan of saunas and steaming hot baths of water, I was delighted to visit Thermëa in the summer and winter, adoring it both times. The spa offers three different pools of various temperatures, including a polar plunge, plus contains two steam baths, two saunas, and a relaxation room, in addition to massages. It’s just big enough to have a variety and just small enough not to be overwhelming. Though it’s most popular in the winter, you can find me at things like this at any time of year. Entrance starts at $59. A wonder of architecture, the Canadian Museum of Human Rights doesn’t just cover Canadian human rights, but those of the entire world. While telling the stories of human rights triumphs and abuses throughout the world, exhibits are also careful to recognize that human rights is an evolving term and is often subjective. The museum features people telling their stories and encourages you to involve yourself too, sharing and thinking about what human rights means and how we can all take an active role in it. On Friday nights it’s open late for Friday Night Rights. Tickets start at $18. It’s a rock wall in the summer, and an ice climbing tower in the winter. No longer must one head to the Rockies to get a chance to ice climb – it’s possible right in Winnipeg at the Club d’escalade de Saint-Boniface! Though this is a membership club, non-members can take lessons on the weekend to learn how to climb. For access to the ice wall for climbing, it’s only $40 per person for non-members and a bargain $10 for members. Read more here.  Take a drive in any direction out of Winnipeg in the summer and you’ll see sweeping fields of bright, neon yellow flowers. I loved the colors as I drove up to Lake Winnipeg and east to Nopiming Provincial Park, just in case anyone forgot we were in the prairies. Just a note on enjoying the flowers – traipsing through the field is a no-no, but I stood just on the edge to take this photo.  My favorite summer memory of Winnipeg, and the overall province of Manitoba, is hard to pick, but I’d have to give the edge to driving out to Nopiming Provincial Park, a couple hours east towards Ontario, and canoeing for 4 days, including pulling up to rocky islands and camping on them. While millions of people flocked to other parts of Canada in the summer, we only shared the experience with a few beavers. It was a true Canadian adventure. Read more here.  Summer is great with all of those lakes, but winter is dreamy, too. The ice is so thick, you can skate, nordic ski, walk, and snowmobile right over it in the middle of winter (obviously look into it first!). My favorite part was hanging and hot-tubbing in the cabin at Falcon Trails Resort. We had everything we needed – a kitchen, warm bedroom, fireplace, plenty of trails, and a couple of wood-fired saunas on the property. It was quite affordable, too! You can book here.  A small-ish population and a whole lot of wide-open spaces makes for some amazingly clear skies. If you’re into stargazing like I am, look up when you’re out at the provincial parks. You might even get lucky and see the aurora if you’re north of Winnipeg.  Talk about a creative exhibit! The Assiniboine Park Zoo’s Journey to Churchill has animals from up north that you can see without having to head out of Winnipeg. The seals and bears are rescues who were orphaned at birth and wouldn’t survive in the wild. It’s wonderful to see them swimming around above you! The bears didn’t feel like swimming when I was there, but the seals were plenty entertaining. For best viewing times, head there between 9:30-11am.  A corn maze by summer and a snow maze by winter, A Maze in Corn not only has a formidable snow maze to explore, but also beautiful snow carvings inside some of the hidden rooms and an ice bar, too! It was so well done, it reminded me of Finland’s Ice Hotel. There are also sleigh rides and sledding options, as well as a massive slide.  Head to the St. Norbert area of Winnipeg to see the Trappist Monastery ruins. I honestly didn’t expect to see this kind of thing in Winnipeg, but have loved exploring the roofless ruins both in summer and winter. I can only imagine how it would look to see the Milky Way through the ruin’s windows!  Though there are numerous festivals going on at any given time in Winnipeg, like the Fringe Festival in the summer, I really enjoyed the Festival du Voyageur in February. You get a nice combination of ice sculptures, a sugar shack with maple syrup taffy (better believe I went twice), and actors answering your questions in character from the fur trading time of the voyageurs. It’s a celebration of history and French, as well as indigenous, culture. Get your adrenaline going swerving around on a frozen Lake Winnipeg in a 6-figure car at the AMG Driving Academy. For the past three years, Mercedes has offered enthusiasts a chance to come to Gimli, just a one hour drive north of Winnipeg, to learn how to drive on the ice. The intention is to spin and swerve, having a blast and learning how to drive in icy conditions in the process. Packages start from a couple of days to longer experiences on the ice. Learn more here.  After my spin in the AMG, I headed to Prairie Helicopters to see the frozen lake and surrounding area from above. I loved the way the snow had drifted over the lake and seeing all of the ice fishing from above, not to mention the Mercedes track! What a lovely way to get a bird’s-eye view of the lake, winter or summer.  While we’re on the topic of Gimli, Lake Winnipeg is Canada’s sixth-largest freshwater lake, bordered by plenty of ‘beach’ towns and full of history and things to do. The north end has Hecla Island, home to many different kids of birds and a favorite vacation spot for Winnipeg locals. I hope if you find yourself in Winnipeg that this list inspires you to give it more time, explore, and fall in love with it as much as I have. I’m always amazed by how much there is to do in and around the city and now that I’ve visited in two distinct seasons, it’s made me love it all the more.  What are your favorite things to do in and around Winnipeg? *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Manitoba. All love towards Winnipeg is my own, as always.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/fall-road-trip-in-quebec/,The Perfect Fall Road Trip in Québec,Canada,"The mist rolled in and out as I made my way down the highway, laughing at the way Google maps pronounces Chemin and Sud, and marveling at how the names of streets and exits manage to be over one hundred letters long, with names abundant in hyphens.  The colors exploded all along the route in fireworks of yellow, orange, and Canadian maple leaf red. Nature was putting on a show and I was an enthusiastic observer. The fall leaves, maple-all-the-things, and perfect shoulder season timing is exactly what I was after.  My road trip in Québec actually started acroos the river in Ottawa, Ontario and then took me on an adventure with wolves, picking apples followed by a maple-themed feast, then to a ski resort and national park and finally onwards to Montreal. For those looking for an autumn adventure, this is my Québec road trip of dreams: This trip begins in Gatineau, flying into Ottawa and making your way over to the Québec side.  On day one I explored the Canadian Museum of History, which was the perfect way to get a lay of the land before beginning on the road trip.  I’ll be honest, I’m usually not a museum person, but I was genuinely engaged by this museum, learning about Canada’s road to where it is now. Like the history of most of the world, there’s plenty of good, lots of bad, and plenty of ‘oh wow, I had no idea,’ moments, which is why I encourage you to visit.  The view from the outside is amazing as well. Admission is $20 CAD per person, and I’d give it at least 3 or so hours, particularly if you like to read every word and engage with the exhibits.  Gatineau Park is over 360 km² of green space for walking, biking, and cross country skiing. During the fall, the leaves change in an explosion of color. I was there just before they began to change, and checked out the Mackenzie King Estate as well as Pink Lake. The lake has a 2 1/2 km trail running around it, which is pretty flat and easy. If you go later in the day during August and September, you’ll be able to see the bright green color of the lake as shown in the photo above due to the abundance of naturally-occurring algae in the water. I learned early on that they love spas in Québec as much as I do! I have really missed the European style sauna after leaving Berlin, but the Nordik Spa-Nature checked all my boxes!  It’s a well thought out spa with 9 saunas that vary from dry to steam and 10 pools of varying temperatures. They have plenty of opportunities to alternate between hot and cold, and they even have a saltwater pool that I floated in for almost an hour, thinking it was only 10 minutes! It was so meditative and relaxing.  Their food is amazing as well. This is a perfect way to finish out the evening since they’re open until 11 PM Sun-Thurs, midnight Fri-Sat. You can find out more here.  I spent the night at Le Bellevue Modern Lodge, a boutique hotel that offers a beautiful morning view of the rolling mist and sunrise over the forest. There is a coffee maker, but either bring some non-perishable breakfast along with you or plan to head out to Wakefield in the morning for noms.  This adorable town has charming architecture, a chocolate factory, little boutiques to pop into, and is close to the Parc Omega. This was my first major stop for the day, where several kinds of foxes, deer, elk, and wolves all run through the 2200 acres that make up Parc Omega. If you can get a spot, you can book yourself into the wolf cabin where you get to spend the night and wake up next to a pack of wolves! Though there are other wolves in the park, the only way to get the wolf cabin experience is to book the room overnight.  It’s also loads of fun to self drive through and take some carrots through the park and feed the elk and deer. I could see this being tons of fun for families, but even as a solo traveler I really enjoyed getting so close to wildlife.  While I absolutely love my wild animal encounters, it’s nature parks like this that help many of us develop a respect and understanding for animals. If I hadn’t had experiences like this as a kid I don’t know if I’d have as much love for nature as I do now.  I don’t think there is a black and white answer to how we interact with animals, but I think that seeing wolves up close can help us care more about fiercely protecting their dwindling wild population. For the evening, I made my way to the Fairmont Le Chateau Montebello, which is the largest log cabin in the world. It’s on the banks of the Ottawa River and offers many boating and kayaking activities in the summer, and nordic skiing in the winter, as well as a huge indoor pool. The hotel was built back in 1930 and very much retains that vibe, with a cozy, cabin style that I adored. The food here is amazing as well, and quite inventive! The next day we leave Outaouais behind and cross into the Laurentian region. This is where I really started to see the beautiful colors in the leaves, as the somewhat higher elevation means brighter colors earlier in the season. I spent the day immersed in the culture, beginning with apple picking and what can only be described as a maple syrup-themed feast, perfectly executed at Labonté de la pomme & Apple Shack, a family-owned farm and apple orchard.  I can’t recommend this place enough for lunch. All of the food is either grown on site, or source from the farms next-door. Finish the meal off with maple taffy on top of ice cream and enjoy the sugar buzz. It’s a perfect brunch spot for several friends. Be sure to contact them to book ahead of time if you want the meal pictured above. Feel free to show them the photo from this blog if you want the same feast of local sausage, maple smoked trout, waffles with bacon and the farm’s cheese, and their apples as well! I love the history of this garden, which is run by a group of 50-80-year-olds who had a collective dream to create a garden that would be accessible for everyone, including those in wheelchairs.  In the summer it’s a blooming garden with several different themes throughout, and in the winter they have a dazzling Christmas light display. I was there during the off-season but it’s the perfect time to pop into their shop and try the pies, teas, sauces, and more that they make out of ingredients grown in the garden. It’s a nonprofit organization that gives back to the local community. To say it’s a feel-good place is an understatement! Finally, if you love bees and honey as much as I do, you’ll love Intermiel. These honey producers take you through the life cycle of the bees, and if you’re in a small enough group, you can even put on a beekeeper uniform and go outside to see them. As I become more passionate about the food I eat, it’s only more apparent how important bees are, and I loved learning about their life cycle and honey production, as well as being able to see what a queen bee looks like!  The shop at Intermiel has everything from mead that is made from the honey to face cream made with the royal jelly from the queen bee. There’s so much more bees can make than just honey, and much of it is restorative and very good for us! I didn’t know that before visiting Intermiel.  So if you want to nerd out on bees, you’ll love Intermiel. The Estérel Resort is gorgeous. It’s located on a lake and offers three different types of saunas and several pools of varying temperatures. They even have a sauna on a dock over the lake, which you can use to alternate hot and cold like a Finnish-style sauna. The best sunrise I had of the whole trip was watching the pink sun come up over the multi-colored trees while the lake steamed and geese flew away into the distance. It was magical. Enjoy the incredible drive through St. Agathe to the Mont-Tremblant National Park. This is where you’ll really see the oranges, yellows, and reds exploding in color. There are numerous lakes and trails to discover, so take a drive and follow whatever signs intrigue you. I highly recommend La Cornische near the Discovery Center. It’s only 3 km long but it gives you a fantastic view of Mont-Tremblant and much of the park. You can access this one through the Accueil de la Diable entrance.  You can camp in the park and it’s open around the clock, so for my stargazers out there, it’s a great spot full of lakes for the stars to reflect on. Apart from hiking, this is a canoer’s dream with all of the lakes to choose from. Just keep in mind there are bears and wolves in the park, but for the most part they like to avoid humans. Tonga Lumina tells the story of Mont-Tremblant with lights, sounds, and interactive exhibits on a short walk through the forest. The display is in both French and English, and encourages viewers to care for the environment.  The lights tell the story of a giant who has been awakened, the same one who shakes Mont-Tremblant. He’s angry because someone took more than he needed from nature. Though this might have been designed with kids in mind, it’s great for adults too, and frankly I can be dazzled for hours by sparkling lights! The Fairmont Tremblant is the largest hotel in the area. You can ski right into it in the winter months! We got a little bit of snow at the very top of the mountain while I was there, but my main view was the gorgeous fall foliage out my window. They, too, have a lovely spa and delicious food.  Take the gondola up to the top of Mont-Tremblant for sweeping views of the area, including colorful trees and if you’re lucky, a little bit of frost at the top. There are several hiking trails that you can take from up there, or you can choose to hike all the way up rather than taking the gondola. I finished my trip up with a 20 minute helicopter ride over Mont-Tremblant. It gave me such a wonderful overview of the colorful trees and as a photographer, it was a dream to get a new point of view so high up! It was the smallest helicopter I’ve ever been in, giving me an opportunity for a private flight. The flights are pretty affordable as well! You can read more here. I finished off the drive by passing through beautiful St. Agathe again, and making my way down to Montreal. If you have the time, give yourself a few days in what everyone says is one of the world’s coolest cities.  My time in Québec gave me a chance to love Canada even more, and to be fascinated by this French-speaking pocket of North America. Come for the beautiful fall foliage, but stay for the food, hospitality, and uncrowded adventures in a beautiful part of Canada.  *This post was brought to you in collaboration with QuébecOriginal.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-places-in-canada-for-solo-travelers/,13 of the Best Places in Canada for Solo Travelers,Canada,"Oh, Canada, you’re one fantastic country to travel in, especially as a solo traveler! For those who love the outdoors, want a safe and incredibly friendly place to travel through, and who want to experience many different cultures all at once, Canada is the perfect solo destination at any time of year. Canada is easy to navigate, has a very low crime rate, is absolutely huge, so you can’t run out of national and provincial parks or activities, and it’s breathtakingly beautiful, need we say more? Though the whole country is worth exploring, these are a few places that my fellow travel bloggers and I think are particularly good for solo travelers in Canada: Alberta was my first stop ever in Canada and by the time I left, I was seriously asking myself if I should just come back and move in. Alberta is a winter wonderland with snow-shoeing tracks, nordic skiing, ice climbing, and ice fishing all nearby. It’s also home to excellent downhill skiing in Banff and Lake Louise. In the summer, it’s the perfect jumping off point for hiking trails galore. Though everywhere in Canada has its own special beauty, this part of Alberta sure is a standout. “When it comes to incredible scenery, you can’t go past the Icefields Parkway in Alberta. The road is often described as the ‘most beautiful drive in the world’ and it’s easy to see why. Snow-capped mountains line both sides of the road, a river runs through the valley, waterfalls tumble down across the rocks and several glaciers are within easy reach. The Icefields Parkway is not particularly long – 233 kilometres from Jasper to Lake Louise – and is easy to do in one direction in a day, even with all the stops. And it’s these stops that make it perfect for a solo traveller. You’ll never have a chance to get bored on this drive because there are constantly places you’ll want to get out of the car to take photos and explore off the road. And then, regardless of which direction you go, you’ll find friendly towns with lots of other travellers at the end of the road trip, in Jasper or Banff National Parks.” – Michael of Time Travel Turtle When I told some Canadian friends that I was heading to Winnipeg for a couple weeks last summer they scratched their heads and asked why. This must be Canada’s most underrated province yet it’s probably the friendliest and one of the least crowded to travel through in the summer months. It also has thousands of lakes so if you’re into paddling, it’s the perfect place to get some solitude. I joined a multi-day canoeing adventure right out of Winnipeg, enjoyed the summer Fringe Festival, and took a road trip around Lake Winnipeg (you can read more about that on my Manitoba writeup on Alamo’s Scenic Drive). “Montreal is an absolutely amazing city that combines the best of North America and Europe into one very walkable place. The people are friendly and there is a ton to do. Old Montreal is full of cafes and European charm and a perfect way to spend a Sunday. Centre-ville is the main part of Montreal and has everything you could want, bars, restaurants, museums and culture. The people in the city are beautiful and incredibly fashion forward. The city would certainly be more enjoyable, however, if you speak French and could be slightly intimidating to a solo traveler that doesn’t speak any French at all (most people in Montreal do speak English, but a little bit of French does go a long way).” – Paige of Miss Travel “Despite being the Capital city of Canada, Ottawa is often skipped over for the bigger, brighter cities of Toronto and Montreal. However, for solo travellers, Ottawa is a a great choice. Part of Ottawa’s charm is that it has the big city attractions with a friendly small town feel and lots of green space. It’s also really easy to get around. Museums, art galleries, parks, the parliament buildings, and the historic Byward Market are all within walking distance of one another. Ottawa is also a student city, with two large universities and a college, so there are plenty of young people around. Plus, Ottawa locals are known to be super friendly. It’s pretty common to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger while waiting for a coffee or while admiring artwork in the National Gallery of Canada. If you visit during the summer head to Major’s Hill Park or Nepean point. Both are favourite hangout spots for locals looking to soak up the sun.” – Hannah of Eat Sleep Breathe Travel “Solo travel is obviously a lot about spending time on your own, but I’ve never felt so alone (in a good way) as I did in Killarney Provincial Park. This is THE place to try canoe camping: paddle from lake to lake, pitch your tent in solitude near the water shore and climb the surrounding granite hills for gorgeous views. The park is so beautiful, it inspired members of the Ontario Society of Artists to capture it in numerous of their paintings and watercolours. During the summer you should leave your flysheet in the bag and sleep under the starry sky, listen closely to the noises of the forest and spot local wildlife from your sleeping bag! For safety and additional paddle power, I hired a guide from Killarney Outfitters. They also provided all the gear and food necessary for a successful and bear-free weekend in the park. If this is your first canoe camping trip – like it was for me – I can only recommend heading out with a guide who is experienced and skilled in order to keep you safe and entertained.” – Kathi from Watch Me See “Vancouver Island is a fantastic destination for solo travellers who love the outdoors. It has all the gorgeous scenery of the Pacific North West with even more snowy mountains, and all on an island off the west coast of Canada. Don’t miss the rugged coastline of Tofino, surrounded by ancient rainforest and with some of the best surfing and whale watching you can find, worth visiting in both summer and winter. If you’re on the island from May to September, the West Coast Trail is a 5 to 7 day hike in the Pacific Rim National Park that calls itself the “hike of a lifetime”. Check out Victoria, the capital of British Colombia and the biggest city on Vancouver Island, which feels kind of like a British city transplanted in Canada, but with a hippy vibe. The people are friendly and often environmentally conscious, which is no surprise given the beautiful surroundings they live in. You can explore Vancouver Island by public transport, hiring a car, or hitchhiking, which is fairly common on the island.” – Sonja of Migrating Miss “Canada was actually one of the first places I ever traveled to solo. I fell in love with the country – and in particular with beautiful Vancouver! For me, Vancouver is one of the few places in the world which has everything – beach, the mountains, beautiful nature, and a big city life. The city center of Vancouver is easily accessible by public transport foot and even by foot, making it perfect for solo travelers. There’s a wide range of good accommodations, from hostels to hotels – or just try Couchsurfing. That’s what I did, and I met some great people. It’s true that Canadians are the friendliest people on earth! A place you can’t miss is the beautiful Stanley Park, offering you beautiful views of the harbor and on the skyline. If you’re looking for a nice workout, hike up the Grouse Grind – you’ll be rewarded by spectacular views of the city. Afterwards, you can relax on the city beach and enjoy the sunset. For me, Vancouver is the perfect city – enjoy your visit!” – Patrick of German Backpacker  “Everyone loves Vancouver and rightfully so. It is perfect for the solo traveller with its bustling bars and jumping hostels but visitors keep missing a gem over the water, Canada’s Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is made up of lots of small towns and even more lakes. Getting around is the only stumbling block for solo travellers as the bus service isn’t that well connected. However, that really isn’t an issue because the types of travellers that hit the Coast in BC are relaxed, friendly and always willing to take others along with them on their trip. Staying at Up The Creek in Roberts Creek comes highly recommended for its relaxed vibes, hammocks on the porch and free bikes to pedal to the bigger towns of Sechelt and Gibsons. Don’t be fooled by the one shop village status, Roberts Creek has a big social calendar of live bands and fayres. The number of return visitors (family, couple, adventure, yoga loving, or solo) is a testament to just how lovely the Sunshine Coast is.” – Gemma of Two Scots Abroad “Calgary is basically Canada’s answer to Denver. A hip, modern city that’s an easy drive to Banff and the rest of the Canadian Rockies, the city itself is small with a distinct neighborhood vibe. Take in the views from Calgary Tower, stop by Canada Olympic Park, and peruse the boutiques, restaurants, and bars downtown on Stephen Avenue Walk. If you come in July, the Calgary Stampede is the big summer to-do with rodeos, concerts and Western events that make for a two-week party.” – Lauren of The Down Lo “What intrigues and excites me about Quebec City is the French influence on everything, be it food, architecture or the spoken language. You will wonder if Canada has a Narnia-like hidden wardrobe that leads you into France! The colorful buildings with their fairytale-esque appearance add to this illusion. Fear not if you don’t know French though, Quebec City is mostly bilingual. However, not everyone speaks fluent English, so keep a map of the city handy and I advise you to learn a few useful sentences in French. Based on JUST one statistic, Quebec City already ranks high for solo female travelers – province with the lowest crime rate in Canada. Other factors that will push Quebec City to the top of the list are – friendly locals, year round beauty and activities, art and culture, bike friendly destination and that sweet.. sweet.. Maple Taffy!” – Pari of Traveling Pari “I have taken many exhilarating solo trips to such far flung places as post-earthquake Haiti and Mali in West Africa, but as a native Albertan, one of my absolute favorite places in the world is a lesser-known outdoor gem called “Kananaskis Country.” This large natural area consists of multiple provincial parks stitched-together along Highway 40 which is about an hour drive west of Calgary. With soaring Rocky Mountain vistas, pristine glacier lakes, stunning alpine meadows and a fraction of the crowds that Banff National Park attracts, K Country is a world-class destination in its own right, and offers plenty of opportunities for a solo trip in the mountains. Active women can get lost in the beautiful sights and dizzying heights on any of the superlative hiking, cycling, and cross-country ski trails that will suit all skill levels. As always when travelling solo, some safety precautions should be taken, so always leave your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member and carry bear spray when on the trails. Making noise is the best deterrent against run ins with carnivores so sing a song to yourself like no one is listening, except for the bears!  For a taste of rustic luxury, book yourself into the beautiful and remote Mount Engadine Lodge and sample the delicious locally inspired cuisine while watching the sun set over the meadow from the lodge’s expansive wrap-around deck. Included in the nightly rates are afternoon high tea with scrumptious treats, an award-worthy dinner, hearty breakfast and a packed lunch to take with you on any number of the adventures accessible from the area. In the winter, you could snowshoe onto the lodge’s meadow, or ski any of amazing nearby trails. In the warmer months, there are endless hiking opportunities and the chance to cycle to the top of the highest paved road in Canada. The possibilities are limited only by how much energy you have. For ladies seeking a more relaxing retreat in the mountains, check into the Delta Hotels Kananaskis Lodge for a weekend of pampering and fine dining in the most gorgeous mountain setting. If Kananaskis is not on your radar for solo female travel already, it should be now. Its exhilarating mountain scenery and breathtaking adventures will give any adventurous woman the chance to get away from it all in the most incredible setting.” – Thea of Zen Travellers “Despite Canada being my neighbor, I’ve not explored it as much as I’d like to say. I grew up going to Niagara Falls a lot and I’ve been to the charming and breath-taking Victoria. Last fall, however, I took my first solo trip to Canada and my first trip ever to Toronto. Like many do, I fell head over heels for this diverse city. Toronto is perfect for a solo traveler and even an inexperienced one at that. The city is easy to navigate, I never felt unsafe (don’t ever let your guard down though), and the city is extremely walkable but there is also great public transportation. I stayed in both a hostel and couchsurfed during my time there and both proved perfect for meeting other people and bettered my solo experience even more!My favorite things to do include exploring the extensive street art including Graffiti Alley and Underpass Park, spending a day in Kensington Market wandering through the shops and sampling food, finding unique coffee shops (my favorite was Odin – a Scandinavian inspired cafe and bar) and eating my way through Toronto. You can find just about any cuisine imaginable in Toronto and as a vegan, I had absolutely no trouble eating to my heart’s content. Don’t forget to keep your eyes peeled as you’re walking around to see all the fun and eclectic parts of the cities such as an entire store devoted to condoms, a Harry Potter themed shop, and a dog fountain.” – Ashley of The Southern Gypsy “My first experience with Toronto was when I arrived for the annual International Film Festival when the city is teeming with movie stars and film hopefuls..  I was pleasantly surprised to find the city easy to navigate on my own by foot, subway or tram.  You can peek into the historical past at the Fairmont Royal York Hotel and Casa Loma castle; marvel at the modern CN Tower and indulge in the farmers market offerings at the St. Lawrence Market.  When you look past the poutine you’ll find a city of diverse food neighborhoods (Little Italy, Little Portugal, Leslieville and The Annex) and food trucks serving a (really good)  taste of the world.  Uniquely Toronto attractions are The Hockey Hall of Fame, Bata Shoe Museum (yes a museum celebrating shoes!) and shopping at Hudson’s Bay. Toronto celebrates its residents and welcomes new guests with warm Canadian hospitality so that your visit is one of many yet to come.” – Suzanne of Phila Travel Girl “Canada is without a doubt one of the most picturesque countries in the world, so that means it’s home to plenty of pretty amazing venue locations for events. I’d argue it’s also the best country in the world to attend a music festival by yourself, because Canadians are the nicest people in the world! So polite, kind, and unbelievably. There are tons of incredible music festivals in Canada to choose from, but I’d personally recommend events like Shambhala, Astral Harvest, Motion Notion, and Osheaga Festival if you’re looking for a solid party! The festival atmosphere is truly intoxicating at these events, and I guarantee you’ll leave the festival with so many new amazing friends. While most people would never think of attending an event like this alone – it can be one of the most rewarding experiences!” – Dave of Jones Around The World Those are a few of our favorite places to travel in Canada, though the list in the world’s second largest country is, of course, probably endless! For safety, outdoor adventures, beauty, and easy-to-navigate cities with plenty to do year-round, Canada has it all. Did we miss anything that should be on this list? Let us know in the comments! *This post was brought to you in partnership with Alamo Rent a car. All thoughts on the best places to travel solo in Canada belong to their respective authors.  Hi Kristin It is great to see such a positive review of my adopted country including my home Montreal. However, as somebody who has traveled a fair amount in the world AND driven Canada from coast to coast, I feel you are doing a big part of the population a disservice when you claim the “13 of the Best Places in Canada for Solo Travelers” and completely neglect a large part of the country.  The maritime provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland are where some of the oldest settlements in North America can be found dating back to the days of the Vikings. Add to that some of the most stunning scenery in the world. Also, speaking as a seasoned traveler, I have always found the Maritimers some of the friendliest people on the planet.  I realize you cannot cover all of such a vast country, after all it spans six time zones, but I hope you will return someday to visit the east. I believe you will be adding many more “best places” to your list. Oh, and then there are the northern Territories. Love your blog. Happy travels. I’d love to see more of Canada! Thanks for adding in some more places. Nice list BMTM! Going to peak into Canada this summer hopefully.  I have these two thoughts! Like you said the list can go on and on….. 1. It is referenced in the Toronto, Ontario listing for a second, but I really enjoyed Niagara Falls, Ontario (and New York on the US side) and the Canadian Falls is the bigger of the two groups of falls. It is fun for solo travelers, couples and families. It goes well with a jaunt to Toronto! I realize it is very touristy, but you can avoid the crowds by timing it right.  2. I would also encourage people to visit New Brunswick/Nova Scotia – two of Canada’s eastern maritime provinces. In these little provinces, you have so many things to explore including whale watching and the funky tremendous tides in the Bay of Fundy (up to 50 feet/15 meters!). Then there are the Reversing Falls (yes literally), gorgeous forests, wildlife, and even small mountains with nice views (especially in the fall!) and a surprisingly challenging climb! To be honest, haven’t been there myself but my travel friends rave about it. Some include it as part of an adventure trip that includes the state of Maine. Did you know Sugarloaf Mountain in New Brunswick is an ancient extinct volcano??  And I encourage people as an extension to the listing of “Winnipeg, Manitoba” to look at Kristin’s posts titled “Murals that Tell a Story of Climate Change in Churchill, Manitoba” and “Whale Watching and Polar Bear Encounters in Canada”.  These are adventures worth pursuing. Imagine kayaking with Belugas coming to you for a visit! Heard great things about Nova Scotia too. I always manage to skip over Canada cause I figure i’ll get there eventually so I should go somewhere further away lol. But everyone who has gone there loves it! I am disappointed that you haven’t mentioned the Maritimes and Newfoundland. I am actually shocked. How did you do your research ?  On a computer, only? The friendliest, funniest, most welcoming people, and in breathtaking surrounds, that will take your breath away, are in the Atlantic Provinces. If you want adventure, hospitality for solo travellers as well as nature, that’s where you should head. By asking people who have been to Canada alone which parts they enjoyed, as you can see from the article 😉 Thanks for the recs, though.  So beautiful! How have I never been to Canada? One thing’s certain, there’s plenty to see! Banff has been on my list for a long time – it is so gorgeous! What do you recommend as can’t miss? here you go! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-banff-winter/ You are definitely in the minority for having enjoyed Winnipeg. Most people are repulsed by it. The Charlevoix region of Quebec is incredible, and a less known area, if you’re more of a nature person, is Northern Ontario. I’ve always been surprised that it’s never become a serious travel destination other than for fishing. A absolutely beautiful place. Repulsed? Whoa, I thought it was so underrated! Hi  I am glad you enjoyed Montreal ! Canada surely is a great and safe country, especially for solo travellers , it is a great place to start your solo adventures!  I love my country Canada, regardless the reputation it is a cold country ! So what!!! W e are a land full of natural and raw beauty ! Excellent article. After reading this post I love to go there. Thanks for sharing.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/seawalls-murals-churchill-manitoba/,"Murals that Tell a Story of Climate Change in Churchill, Manitoba",Canada,"Churchill, Manitoba is known as the ‘Polar bear capital of the world’. It’s also home to roughly 800 people who, due to recent extreme weather and flooding, have been left more or less stranded and forgotten. Every winter, hundreds of polar bears gather and wait for the ice to form over Hudson Bay. However, due to global warming and climate change, their icy hunting grounds are shrinking rapidly, keeping the polar bears on shore longer than they should be. As a result, it has become a challenge for the polar bears to hunt seals after their summer fast. Yikes. Art has recently played an important role in displaying the disastrous effects of climate change in Churchill. Organized by the Pangea Seed Foundation’s Sea Walls project and Winnipeg artist, Kal Barteski, several muralists from around the world joined forces in the small town and created 18 large-scale murals that promote ocean conservation not only in Churchill, but worldwide. The paintings were completed in June of this year, leaving behind stunning murals on old buildings and giving us another reason beyond belugas, polar bears, and northern lights, to explore Churchill. The project had its challenges. The artists had to be creative getting to Churchill due to the rail closure caused by a major flood this spring. Given there are no roads and the shipping port receives very few boats, overland transportation had to be replaced by flights, and the artists could not bring as many supplies with them as they would normally have at their disposal. The closure of the rail has heavily impacted the locals as well, who are receiving far fewer supplies, fuel, and food than in previous years. Many also lost their jobs, and given the rail company has no plans of rebuilding, the town is suffering and feeling forgotten, left with an uncertain future. The local residents donated whatever they could, and many were depicted in the murals as well, which feature animals, people, and the northern lights. These are the individual messages of each of the murals:  In the artist’s words, “What I see happening in Churchill, Manitoba is frighteningly similar to what was happening in Michigan in the 1970s, 1980s, and through the present. You had the livelihoods of millions of people in Michigan tethered on life support to one industry. When that industry fled and shut down, the rest of the economy followed slowly, like a body’s delayed reaction before it realizes that the head is gone. Instead of millions of people like in Michigan, this time in Churchill there are less people, less companies, and less variables; hundreds of people, a single port that’s now closed, and a single rail line, now washed out.” You can read the full artist statement on this mural here. The story behind this plane wreck is interesting too: This Commando cargo aircraft was named Miss Piggy due to the size of the loads she carried. On 13 November 1979, a drop in oil pressure caused the overloaded aircraft to perform a forced landing ¼ mile short of the runway. Three crewmen were injured but all survived. Today, Miss Piggy has turned into an official tourist attraction for Churchill. This was one of my favorite murals, since you can explore the inside as well as admiring the artwork. The polar bear on this mural was reconstructed by the artist using pieces and fragments, which represent an attempt to fix what humans have destroyed in nature. “Painting them in large scale is a friendly way of asking for respect, and making people feel small when faced with the grandeur of nature.” Dulk’s is one of the more sinister murals, showing the decay and death of the polar bears. In his words: “As a family of polar bears and begulas make their last winter journey on earth, the cub held on to its treasured iceberg, which illustrated the threat of polar bears survival due to the increased melting of the Arctic.” The artist cleverly used the building’s architecture to portray a larger-than-life, peacefully sleeping polar bear. “The location of this bear, on the polar bear holding facility, highlights the intensity and necessity of wildlife management along polar bear migration paths where polar bears, the largest predators in the world, continue to adapt to the shameful realities of our consumer-driven culture.” Of the Sea Walls festival which she organized in Churchill, she told me, “For me, the festival was exceptionally meaningful. It was important to me to show the Town of Churchill a glimpse of my gratitude. I’ve been welcomed into their community since I started visiting in 2011 and I’ve found powerful inspiration and purpose in my experiences with polar bears (and polar bear people). It was important to me to give thanks and give back. Initially, my hope was that the festival would leave the community with an opportunity to create a mural tour and generate another source of tourism income, but what we experienced while we were painting was a beautiful shift of the morale. It has been a devastating period for the small town that relies on the rail for so much of their daily life – having the artists and the energy from the festival made a remarkable change in their outlook – and ours. I am excited to see if the murals have a long-term effect. I hope to get back there to add to the collection and help the community in any way I can.”  According to the artist, the bears “stand as a record of Churchill as it is today, they are based on real bears that I have met over the years… As the two first bears weather and likely disappear, the ever-present beluga whales will emerge to take their place as the focal point of the piece. The third bear will also remain, as a somewhat mysterious and judgmental figure.” The phrase, “Human Nature”, according to the artist, signifies a universal excuse to justify everything we are doing wrong in this world. “Churchill is a town where this is the underlying drama at all times. It’s a town so dependent on the natural environment and its wildlife and is simultaneously threatened by it too. Everything in Churchill has a duality, a total double edge to it. The text on the mural illustrates this tension and also draws from the parallels in texture of both the natural and industrial environments of the town. “Celebrating the resilience of the north throughout the passage of time, a place man and nature meet, where humans choose to walk together or face a great divide. As they navigate the unknown climate, government & corporate challenges that will shape their future.” Beautiful.  These two murals aim to send a message to fishermen to consider their waste and disposal of fishing debris. The in-your-face mural with the phrase, “Know I’m Here,” “creates a strong message of valuing the people of Churchill, but also communicating to all people that we need to read the water and world around us in order to know our place and take actions to nurture what we have been given.”  This mural has a dual purpose, both in memoriam of a young girl who drowned off the coast of Churchill, and the following statement from the artist: “Spirit in the water, spirit in the sky, spirit on the earth, all are connected. My piece is about ancestral legacy, what was passed on to us and what we will leave for our children’s children. She may be the Creator or Sedna the Inuit goddess of the sea. She may be Jessie Tootoo, a healer or grandmother. Whoever she is, from her open hands the Aurora is unleashed, the ethereal cosmic voice of the ancestors speaking to us. The beluga swims through the aurora, a spirit guide legacy reminding us of what is truly valuable and worthy.”  This was one of my favorite murals. It reminded me so much of Teufelsberg in Berlin, though this is a tribute to the first nations people, the Dené, who like so many natives, were forced off their land. For more on the history, read on here.  In the artist’s words: “On my last day in Churchill this gorgeous wall called me. I managed to put this image up that has haunted me for years now. Calling out amid extinction, the silent roar dissolving into the fog of memory.”  This mural speaks to the struggle of the bears and the local residents in Churchill. The artist painted a polar bear sitting and waiting for the return of the ice, “ just as the people of Churchill await the repair of the recently damaged rail line; a vital link to their livelihood and access to essentials.” This painting focuses on the railway closure issue by displaying port workers struggling as tightrope dancers on the railway. “It stands as a metaphor for how fragile life can be in subarctic terrain and how essential the railway and our oceans are for the survival of the people.” According to Li, “For my piece I have depicted two scenes, a local conservation officer from the town and a flurry of Polar bears, Arctic sleigh dogs and or wolves. Poised to shoot cracker shells, the main tool to scare off bears, the uniform and stance of the officer allude to times of hunting and stand for human aggression |…| In the context of the town and specifically the recycling center where this mural was painted, the interaction between bears and conservation officers are extremely common and the reading of this piece becomes more specific. In the broader context and more central to theme is the fact the image radiates outward from a division line. Instead of man vs nature here, it is two sides of the same coin. Both humans and endangered species are in a state of fight or flight. A heightened sense of emergency due to climate change and the long list of global issues place everything in a precarious position. In a town such as Churchill the tensions are local but the story is global.”  This lone building is located across from “Know I’m Here” and for a brief period each summer, is framed by this beautiful purple flower, fire weed. According to the artist, “my artwork addresses the circulation of water in the world in connection to the Pump House on which my mural is painted. The water travels from the Pump House to the faucet, to the people, back to the ocean, plants, and back to the Pump House again. We are all connected and depend on the health of our water supplies and sources to survive. Simply put, water is life.”  This mural is a tribute to the many seabirds in and around Churchill. The murals are located in various spots all along the Hudson Bay. In a few hours, it’s possible to drive around and visit all of them (here’s a map), all while enjoying the landscape and scouting polar bears as well. My thoughts are with the town of Churchill, and especially the polar bears and belugas who made an appearance during my time there in July. Climate change is a subject I’m passionate about and I hope that the story of these murals and the message they intend to send reaches more people in Canada and beyond. Because, at least for now, Planet Earth is the only home we have. This is so sad. No port, declining commerce plus climate change affecting the polar bears and beluga whales… It’s amazing how art can send powerful messages across, I hope people of authority hear them and be moved to act! Thanks for telling this incredible story about Churchill and the artists and climate change. So well done. This could be in National Geographic. Such beautiful artwork with limited resources rivaling any artwork in the world and telling such a narrative. The whole issue with the railroad is a shame and hopefully it can be back up and running before winter even with the propane shipped to them.The good news is while they claim melting permafrost and extreme weather is hurting the ability of the rail line to function, it really is more about properly maintaining the rail road and putting in the money to do so, than trying the patch and fix it approach. This applies to all transportation infrastructure, both in Canada and the U.S., maintenance is paramount, let that go and you will pay multiple times later and you will have old, failing bridges (remember Minneapolis?).Churchill used to have a population of 5000 or so and now is down to 800-900. One could argue that it isn’t worth the expense to keep a community like this going, but as you can see from this post, are you kidding me?  What I am excited about is how the tribal community is trying to see if they can purchase the railroad and maintain it using their intimate knowledge of the terrain and the fact that they actually care about it. Sometimes you just have to take things into you own hands, although I don’t see the bigger cities not taking handouts like crazy :). If the area could find a way to handle all of its core functions without dependence on for-profit rail roads or industries with no personal interest in the area, that would be ideal (need the government there but as assistance not dependence). I guess this touches me because this issue of northern communities also has been dealt with to me insensitively in other areas of the world like the small tribal communities in Alaska.This rail line benefits not only Churchill, but all the communities in the region and bigger does not mean better.I hope that people like you, Kristin, can bring this story to more prominence, especially among those who would want to tour the place for its majestic wonders. I read an article claiming Churchill was like Detroit, a city left behind. I disagree, Churchill is more like Pittsburgh, an old steel town that adapted and reinvented itself, to become a thriving city. Not to say you don’t want the other extreme of a lot development.Instead of banks and technology for Pittsburgh, Churchill has such natural wonders and history that can complement the waning industrial and scientific research conducted there. More polar bears congregate there than anyplace in the world (pretty much) and where can you swim with belugas and observe polar bears on the same day!?  Weather enthusiasts would enjoy the extremes experienced there. Oh and I forgot about the cool military fort, Eskimo museum, a former rocket range, and of course Ms. Piggy. Then there is the warmth of the people. The kids are cute and you interacted so awesomely with them, like a favorite aunt.As for the climate change angle, what is neat to see is how much is starting to get done at the grass roots levels where things really get done. It is no coincidence so many of the strongest pushes for carbon neutrality are the big coastal cities, no matter the politics of the state they are in. So many mayors have signed on in the U.S.  While any impacts are still in the noise in the lower latitudes people don’t realize how much change is already occurring in the high latitudes!  Art is a great way to convey the anxiety, concern and observations concerning the change being witnessed up there in addition to the concrete story. Churchill is one the most remarkable places I’ve visited. I loved reading about the artworks on walls in the remote town.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/whale-watching-canada/,Whale Watching and Polar Bear Encounters in Canada,Canada,"I felt the kayak rocking beneath me and glanced down. A playful, grinning white face looked back up at me, her head cocked to the side as only Belugas (and Narwhals) can do. We checked each other out, she whistling and me squealing in delight, equally curious about the other creature we were seeing. I went to Churchill in the far north of Manitoba in Canada with the express purpose of seeing Beluga whales. Each summer between June and August, 60,000 of them swim into the brackish water of the Hudson Bay where the temperature is slightly warmer and more hospitable for their calfs. They reminded me of the bottlenose dolphins I grew up seeing off the coast of California, playful, curious, and not the least bit shy. I always felt a kindred tie to them, being as much of a fish myself as a person can be. In Churchill there are several ways to interact with them, both dry and wet. First, we took a zodiac boat out and watching as they get closer and closer, swimming under and around the boat. Things got even more exciting when we climbed into kayaks that afternoon, paddling in the calm bay while slowly but surely, they came over and started bubbling up around us and even getting close enough to bump my boat. I kept giggling and squealing (which you already know if you watched in my Instagram story from the day). We also snorkeled with them, donning dry suits and floating in the frigid water. I know it was cold but, to be honest, I hardly even noticed because I was so engaged with what I was seeing below, listening to the whistles of the belugas and almost crying with delight while they floated under me, looking up and smiling. Few animal activities have allowed me to get this close to the wildlife. There was the standout experience of seeing a Manta ray glide right over my head in Komodo, Indonesia, and the magic of standing just a few feet away from Gorillas in Uganda, and now this rounds out my top three wildlife experiences. That’s not even all there is up in Churchill, though. It’s a triple threat, with possible polar bear and northern lights sightings as well. I visited with Lazy Bear Expeditions, which also took us out on a boat up north to see if we could find some bears as well. Though they’re much more common in the autumn months, unfortunately the belugas are already gone by then, and they were my main draw. By heading up in late July, I got to have both. As far as I know, Lazy Bear is the only outfit in town with a boat of this size that takes you out to see the bears in the summer. Otherwise, in the fall, it’s all about the arctic crawlers in the tundra, so this is a unique experience. The trip also includes other extras, like exploration around town to this downed aircraft.  You can climb in and around it, which I absolutely loved, as did the kids on the trip. You can also kindly ask for a wake up call if the aurora activity is high enough and the skies are clear. Since Churchill has the possibility of seeing the northern lights 330 days of the year, you just might see them, even in the summer. Sadly due to a combo of low activity and clouds I didn’t see them this time but that’s okay, I did in Iceland and Finland and I will again one day, I’m sure of that. Before visiting Manitoba I had no idea how many cool things there are to see there. I was shocked that so few of my travel blogging peers had made it up to Churchill, considering how incredibly cool it is to see Belugas, and how close I was able to get to them. Manitoba is so underrated. Go for the animals, and stay for the provincial parks and 100,000 lakes. Getting there: After a flood wiped out a section of tracks this year, now the only way to get up to Churchill is to fly. Lazy Bear offers a chartered flight as part of their package. Costs: The base rate for the trips with Lazy Bear start at $4,000 CAD (roughly $3100 USD at the time of this writing), which includes the flight, accommodation, most meals, and most activities with a few add-ons. For solo travelers: This isn’t a trip that’s easy to do independently. You need someone around who has a gun (just to scare off the bears if needed), and to be in a group for safety reasons. The kayaks and the trips are all tied to various lodges, so book ahead before traveling to Churchill. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Lazy Bear Expeditions. All thoughts on the amazing Beluga encounters are my own. Looks absolutely incredible to be able to get so close to those whales. Can’t believe how many there were of them! I wonder what’s the story of the plane, I can’t enough of the abandoned things and places… I wrote about that too! Next article on Wednesday 🙂 What an amazing experience! Snorkeling with the whales is something I must do 🙂 This sounds awesome! Sounds like one of those trips that costs a bit of money but is 100% worth it This is true. Fantastic photos! Sometimes its so worth it to pay a little extra for a tour that really leaves you breathless…and gives you an up-close experience with some amazing animals! My up-close-and-personal experience with the swimming pigs in the Bahamas was certainly something I´ll never forget! I’d love to see those guys! I wanted to see the Belugas! What an incredible experience. We baulked at heading to Churchill during our recent trip to Canada as our budget was getting tight, but this post has renewed our interest. If it’s anywhere near as incredible as mantas and gorillas then we’d be crazy not to put it right at the top of our bucket list. Better start saving . . . . thanks for the inspiration! The video and description of your encounter with the belugas was nothing short of unbelievably cool! Your videos get better each time. My only experience with belugas are in the aquarium and I worry about them because even if it is the biggest tank in the world it isn’t nearly enough space! To swim with them would be worth the trip to Churchill alone! What a big pull for me. I am into marine life. Hope to experience a loggerhead nesting, swim with manatees and let’s add belugas to the list! Did not realize Churchill had so much to offer with the museum, art work rivaling any big city in the U.S. (with the limited resources too!), polar bears and beluga experiences in the same week (in addition to scientific research which is what I am into, the bay itself, the interesting history, other wildlife, etc.)!  I am most familiar with Churchill more from the meteorological side with it being a favorite place to mention in weather forecasts about arctic chills coming down to the United States. Little do they know it can reach 99F (37C, well it is the record high) in addition to sub -40F (and C) in the winter. The big deal up there I think is reaching freezing in January. It has never happened in recorded history in Churchill. The record high is 30F and they have kept records for a long time. I remember they forecasted freezing a few years back and everyone was worrying about climate change but it hit 30F. If that ever happens, it will be a really big deal there. Something like thunderstorms in Barrow, Alaska several years back which is super rare.It is great how you support these small communities and less known jewels by your site. It is a great side effect of your work! Hope they get that train back up and running, feel bad it is an American company that is sitting on their heels, maybe the locals can buy it and fix it!As a point of discussion for all: Let’s not let climate change be an excuse to abandon these northern communities in favor of another area. Sometimes a real big problem can be exploited politically to push another agenda. You really can be exactly sure what will happen. Sure the frozen road might last shorter and there might be higher water levels, but you can adapt and who knows what will happen exactly there versus elsewhere (e.g. the Yukon)! Some things are obvious like coastal city management and adaptation, but assuming stronger monsoons in SW U.S. or SE Asia versus weaker and stronger versus weaker hurricanes/typhoons in the Gulf coast/SE Asia is not so clear!I might revisit this with the next post you made if that is okay with everyone! Ugh, meant “really can’t be sure!” in the last paragraph! Thanks as always for your insightful comments! I am also hoping that there is a way that the railroad can get fixed and also feel bad it’s a private American company causing the issue. Baby beluga!! Is the water warm, is your mama home.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/manitoba-things-to-see/,7 Gorgeous Reasons to Visit Manitoba,Canada,"On busy city mornings I’ll close my eyes and return to this place – the mist gently rolling over the warm lake water while the red sun rises, calling me to paddle out to it. This is Manitoba, Canada’s province known for its golden prairies, dramatic skies, and hundreds of thousands of lakes. Churchill in the north of Manitoba is the polar bear capital of the world, and it’s home to some other amazing white creatures too – beluga whales. Manitoba is also known for bird sightings, like hawks, snowy owls, bald eagles, and hundreds more. The omnipresent feeling I get in Manitoba is one of calmness. Forget hustle and bustle. This is a place to go for a swim, paddle out into the wilderness, lay in the sun on a warm summer day, and just enjoy. Manitoba has nearly 12 million acres of protected lands and beyond that, so much wide open space. You don’t have to wander too far to feel solitude. Manitoba covers 250,900 square miles – that’s twice the size of the United Kingdom. Yet the province has a total population of 1.3 million people compared to the UK’s 65 million people. It’s safe to say that Manitobans get plenty of personal space! The provincial parks here are quiet and you can still find solitude. Compare that to Banff in Alberta which smashes visitor number records year after year (especially given that national parks are free on Canada’s 150th birthday), and I’m content sitting in Nopiming on a paddling adventure, looking out at the trees and the lake from my vantage point without another soul in sight, in the wilderness. Canada has more lakes than any other country on planet Earth, and Manitoba has over 100,000 of them! If you love swimming, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, rafting, boating and sunning yourself on the beach, Manitoba is the perfect spot. In the desert and the mountains it’s the topography that takes center stage, on the coast it’s the ocean, but in the prairies, it’s that incredible, endless sky. Manitoba is situated at the perfect latitude to put on aurora borealis displays, stunning sunrises and sunsets, powerful thunder storms, and in the absence of all of those, a crystal clear milky way. Apart from a warm and beautiful summer, other things about Manitoba make it feel like there’s warmth exploding everywhere. Just look down on the ground in the summer months when the bright yellow sunflowers and canola fields are in bloom. I couldn’t stop pulling over to take pictures of them, admiring the way the yellow changed to reflect that incredible sky. Manitobans have the reputation of being friendly people, as you’ll see proudly proclaimed on the license plates, and I found this to be true. There seems to be very little reason for the Manitobans to be unhappy. The cost of living in Manitoba is low, with housing, energy, insurance, and education among the least expensive in Canada. Manitobans also volunteer and donate at one of the highest rates in Canada. On a personal level, I found almost everyone to be approachable and talkative, which makes it easy to feel relaxed and jovial. I know I should radiate good cheer regardless of my surroundings, but it sure is easier when everyone around you does, too. As my time in Manitoba comes to a close I can’t feel anything but impressed by the variety. It’s such an underrated province and while I think that has probably contributed to how calm and friendly it feels, I also think more people need to know about the incredible things there are to see here. Come for the polar bears and belugas, and stay for the delicious food culture in Winnipeg, the endless canoeing in the many lakes and rivers, the sweeping canola fields, and the beautiful sky. *This post was written on my ZAGG keyboard and brought to you in collaboration with Zagg, though all opinions of awesome Manitoba are my own.  Well, you have convinced me with your recent Manitoba posts! It is one of the few Canadian provinces I have not visited yet and now I want to go 🙂 That lake photo at Nopiming Provincial Park really look amazing, can’t wait to visit manitoba!! That was one of my favorite places! Can’t help but smile reading about such a peaceful and friendly place! 🙂 Hello, I’m from Viet Nam. I really like your blog. It makes me want to come to Manitoba at least one time. Unfortunately, I don’t have money! Haizzz! At least, I have known about this beautiful land.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/nopiming-provincial-park/,Canoeing in Manitoba’s Nopiming Provincial Park,Canada,"You kind of stop caring about this minor detail when you spend most of your days swimming in refreshing water – not too hot or not too cold – paddling along in a canoe looking at the beautiful trees and occasional beaver, and enjoying nature without much of anyone else around. There’s something so beautiful to be said about camping right on the edge of an island, nothing but the sounds of the birds in the trees and the water lapping at the rocks below. There are no humming motors of RVs, no selfie sticks, and no shower queues. The best bath in the world is right outside, anyway. Bonus: there are little wild blueberries growing along the shore in case you need a mid-swim snack. There’s this idea that all there is to see when on vacations is mountains or the ocean, but I couldn’t disagree more, despite being an avid lover of both. (That said, Banff is amazing in the winter, I’m not putting it down!) I love it when I get to be one of the first people to experience something new like this, don’t you? It’s a 3 night/4 day trip and we paddle for 2-3 hours each day and camp each night with all of the equipment provided by Twin River Travel. It’s super well-organized, the gear is clean, the tents are roomy, and I love the guides. There are 10 of us spread out over 4 canoes, which means that if someone gets tired, there is always the option for two people to sit in the canoe and rest rather than paddle. I’m so glad I took a summer trip to the prairies, and it’s okay to me that it’s still under the radar. (But I’m cool with letting you in on the secret). Contact Twin River here to check out their options if this adventure interests you. They also offer day trips from Winnipeg if you want something shorter, and yoga and photography trips depending on your pleasure. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Manitoba, but all thoughts of this awesome canoeing trip are my own, and Twin River did not ask for a favorable review.  It’s easy to forget that simpler kinds of nature can be just as fulfilling, or even more so, as the dramatic landscapes that are popular. This sounds like it was an amazing trip, Manitoba sounds really nice 😀 It is nice! I love it here. Wow, what a beautiful area! I will be traveling to Manitoba a bit over the next year for work…I will definitely be checking this park out 🙂 Have fun it’s awesome! I’d never considered Manitoba as a canoeing retreat before. However, the photos you share here make this look like a wonderful, serene getaway. I’m looking into flights now before the season passes! Thanks for sharing this beautiful post. That’s awesome! Have fun and let me know how it goes for you! This sounds like a true vacation! It is great how you find enjoyment in simply being away from it all, being one with nature in its many beautiful forms. Manitoba from your pictures has its own beauty including the pretty lakes/rivers, trees (or grasses depending on where), and wow that sky! Also, peace and quiet. I love the sound of lapping water and especially sunlight reflecting off the moving water. What else do you need (well, that awesome food, and clean gear is a plus!!)? Great picture of the night sky with the aurora. Need help with mosquitoes? Just bring one of our family with you and they will bite us instead, we are mosquito magnets. We literally carry rubbing alcohol with us to keep the bites from itching later!On the more adventurous side, the Canadian prairies can have some wild weather with it currently the latter half of tornado season. I have had co-workers in my previous job storm chase up there.  They had a wicked F5 tornado in Manitoba about 10 years ago (Elie, Manitoba). The number of tornadoes isn’t as high as the U.S. tornado alley, but the tornado season is shorter and they all occur in the southernmost part, from the park you were at down to the U.S. border.You also mentioned and linked  your post on Wisconsin (man, those caves are awesome, not just Dells over there which are interesting to me) and its beauty. Wisconsin in the snow is so beautiful, I can’t pinpoint it, it just is, sorry Minnesota, but you’ve got the lakes! And the black sand beaches…Anyhow, with few exceptions, if you have an adventurous, curious side with a love for outdoors or history, you can find fascinating things anywhere you travel. The adventures are endless that way! Once I was in little Muscle Shoals, AL for training and it intersected the Passover holiday. Who knew that I would participate in a Passover Seder at the one synagogue in neighboring Florence, see Helen Keller’s home including where she first said “water!”, and enjoy the beautiful Tennessee River in a matter of a few days! (and get my training I needed that led to completing my degree!). It was funny when I got back and was asked “what in the heck did you do to pass the time there between trainings?” I would love to see those caves in Bayfield in the winter, all iced over. Looks incredible! Teleporting to that 5 billion star hotel NOW! Lol    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hecla-island-guide/,"A Guide to Beautiful Hecla Island, Manitoba",Canada,"Greetings from warm Manitoba where summer is in full swing and I’m in between swims and forest walks. This is that quintessential summer destination where driving by canola fields, endless prairies, and lakes makes me feel like I’ve been transported into that good wholesome time our grandparents used to talk about with a twinkle in their eyes. I’m speaking of Hecla Island in Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park, nestled on Lake Winnipeg. Just a few hours north of the city of Winnipeg, this island has tons to do without the crowds. From boating to fishing, swimming, golfing, cycling, and wildlife viewing, it’s perfect for a long weekend escape.  These are a few of my favorite things to do there: My guess is you’ll be heading up the coast of Lake Winnipeg from the city of the same name. There are a fair amount of things to see on the way: This little ‘seaside’ village has a few cool-looking docks worth stopping off and taking a look at. I also popped by the Whyteworld Emporium and convenience store for some water and the owner gave it to me, ‘as a gift’ since he didn’t have small change. I was so touched! Kind people like that deserve lots of business so please stop in and say hello! For history buffs and especially those with Icelandic heritage, Gimli is the spot for Viking reminiscing. The area is known as ‘New Iceland’ and is home to the second largest Icelandic population outside of Iceland. You’ll find a viking statue, Icelandic sweets at Sugar Me Cookie Boutique, and a Viking museum if that strikes your fancy. There’s also a marina for the photo buffs out there like me. Gimli also hosts an annual Icelandic festival in August if you really want to get into the spirit – and people do with costumes, shields and everything! If you’re using a GPS or Google Maps it will probably lead you to highway 8, but if you put Camp Morton (below) into your GPS you’ll be led down highway 222 which hugs the lake. I saw a bunch of quirky old half-collapsed barns and old buses along the way and something about the way they are just left there as a relic of history delights me. You just don’t see that kind of thing everywhere.   Speaking of old buildings, pop by Camp Morton, built in 1937, to see the old church and go for a swim. It’s open to explore and walk through and even picnic in. This is a perfect spot for golden hour if I’ve ever seen one. The reeds growing up all around the marsh are a playground for birds, frogs, and people of course. Regardless of whether you go for sunrise or sunset, you’ll see a nice reflection on the plants and the water. Plus, like the rest of the island, it’s possible to get it all to yourself. After the boardwalk you’ll enter the park. Ask for a map so that you can find your way around, as Google Maps has yet to label most of the cool stuff that follows: The lighthouse trail is a quick one through a little forested area, departing from the Lakeview Hecla Resort and through the golf course. It took me about 15 minutes and opened up into a beautiful bay. It’s also right on the edge of one of the deepest parts of Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest lake in the world. These old lighthouses were so quaint and cute, and perfect for some golden hour drone flying and photographing. I didn’t have to battle any crowds, either, as I was the only one there! I got this beach almost all to myself, at sunset of all times! I loved that I could see the pink sun perfectly as it set behind Little Punk Island, a quirky name that nobody seems to know the origin of. The beach is great for swimming as well, so why not combine watching the sunset while taking a dip? You can also walk to or from the beach to the lookout tower, which takes about 15 minutes each way through a forest and along limestone cliffs. From the resort, take a right and pass Gull Harbor. You’ll see signs for the beach a few kms down. Hecla Island is great for bird enthusiasts, and you might spot some fox, deer, moose, bears, and coyotes as well. For a deeper appreciation of the area, the history, and the wildlife, I recommend a morning walking tour with Dr. Heather Hinam of Second Nature Discovery, AKA Dr. Hoo. She’s a PhD with a background specifically in owls and spent her life in and around the island, so she knows her stuff! Dr. Heather told me this is a perfect sunrise spot, and I believe it. The direction of the quarry, which is basically a few limestone cliffs and rocks that are fun to scramble on and wander through, would perfectly reflect the glow of the rising sun. There are a couple of fossils which Dr. Heather can point out as well, given the whole area used to be under an ocean. For a sense of the island’s history and to get another point of view, take a late afternoon zodiac tour on the lake. This is a new offering and a fun way to check out some of the other nearby islands. The tours are led by Captain Curtis Grimolfson, whose family has been on the island for generations. You’ll even notice when you drive in that the causeway is named after his father. Book the tour via the office at Gull Harbor. I stayed at the Lakeview Hecla Resort and we need to talk about how comfortable those beds are! I also highly, highly recommend the Escape to Black Island massage at the Salka Spa. It was an hour of hot stone, steam towel cocoon, facial cleansing bliss that makes my top five massages. Seriously, and I’m a connoisseur. I didn’t expect that in such a small place! Ask for Adrian – she’s awesome. The food at the restaurant is pretty good too. I recommend the ribs! I took them back to my room and ate them while taking a nice hot bath, because I could, you know? If the hotel is out of your budget or you just want to sleep under the stars, you can also camp on the island. You’ll see signs for the campgrounds to your right once you start driving through the park. You can’t miss it! From time to time it’s possible to see the northern lights on the island, and what a sight that would be reflecting on the water! Unfortunately the aurora activity was low while I was there, but check out the forecast and set your alarm, and you just might be dazzled by a lights display. That would be the cherry on top of a fantastic trip, wouldn’t it? My trip to Hecla Island reminded me that there are still places in North America that are quiet, laid back, and not absolutely mobbed in the summer. Yet it had everything a perfect summer destination should: lots to do, swimming, hiking, good food, and friendly people. Just a few hours north of Winnipeg, if you’re looking for a weekend escape or a reason to explore more of Manitoba, pop by Hecla Island. It’s a little slice of tranquil paradise. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Manitoba, but all thoughts of this lovely little island are my own.  How do you find all these awesome off the beaten path places?? This looks like a really cool spot, and I’ve already had my eye on Manitoba so I could easily combine the two into a cool little trip I mean Winnipeg lol, not Manitoba! Though I imagine the whole state has cool stuff to offer! Ugh I meant province xD Apparently my brain is elsewhere right now It’s pretty rural there so you don’t have to look too far to find these little gems 🙂 it’s basically what there is outside of Winnipeg! Next time please stop in our Beautiful community Riverton ❤️ Beautiful! As a pilot, theres nothing I like more than a birds-eye view of a place. It looks like you’ve really found a little slice of tranquility bursting with nature and wildlife. North America never fails to keep surprising us! The thing which makes me happy about your writing is walking way Wetland Board walk. I want to go and live that experience.Silence, birds and nature..very exciting Lighthouse trail, Gimli, and Hecla Island are like paradise to me. You’ve got some pretty pictures above to lure me for another trip. Bravo! Would love to be there when the northern lights can be seen! Also, GREAT high-angle shots! Thanks for the guide, Kristin. Now I know where to look first should I decide to visit Hecla Island. I am a bird lover and the island sounds just like something I would like. Enjoyed your article.Can you tell me how to get to The Wetlands Boardwalk. What road is it off? It’s going to be right before the permit collection kiosk on the right 🙂 Is there a way to see the information for the boat tour? We’re going to Hecla and would love to do a boat tour but I can’t find any info online anywhere! They were a pretty small operation that didn’t have a website yet, so I’m not sure if they ever really got off the ground. I suggest contacting Travel Manitoba and referencing this post, since they set me up with it: https://www.travelmanitoba.com/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-banff-winter/,8 Adventurous Things to Do in Banff in the Winter,Canada," Canada, particularly Alberta, has been on my must-see list for quite some time. I mostly blame thank Instagram for planting the seed in my mind that I had to get to Canada after seeing images of Lake Louise popping up all over the place. Then Banff flooded my feeds and I started to wonder what other treasures might be nestled up north, just begging to be explored. I came to find that there are tons of reasons to jet over to Alberta, from ice climbing to skiing to beautiful mountain views. An unexpected treat was getting a lot of these otherwise incredibly popular summer destinations almost entirely to myself in the winter. As a solo traveler, I found Banff and the surroundings to be the perfect adventure destination with tons to do that didn’t require a partner in crime, and that gave me plenty of opportunities to meet friendly Canadians and other visitors. If you’re looking to check out Banff in the winter, here are some of the absolute best things to do whether you’re stag or with others: Since hiking can be made quite difficult by mounds and mounds of snow in the winter, snowshoes are the perfect solution. By distributing your weight more, they help you to sink into the snow less and stay warmer and less snowy than hiking with just snow boots would be, opening up pretty much endless possibilities. There are trails all over the Banff and Canmore area, but the hike I took to Chester lake was particularly lovely. It’s about 10 km round-trip and even without the gorgeous hike, staying at Mt. Engadine Lodge nearby and just drive there along the picturesque spray lakes drive makes it worth it! In the summertime, the lakes around Banff – Two Jack lake, Lake Minnewanka, and Vermilion Lake, are all pretty popular with tourists and photographers. However in the winter, there are far fewer people around trying to battle with you for the best sunrise photo spot. All of these lakes also work pretty well for the sunset. Bonus: the sunrises are later and the sunset is earlier in the winter, so it’s pretty easy to catch both! I love the way that the ice had cracked along the lakes and seeing people play hockey on the ice! It’s certainly a quite different perspective than the typical photos you will see of these lakes. People who visit Banff in the summer probably don’t realize that it’s actually home to three ski resorts with excellent skiing in the winter! The main ski areas are Sunshine Village, Lake Louise Ski Resort, and Mount Norquay. I skied at sunshine Village and Lake Louise, and went tubing at Norquay and enjoyed them all. As a beginner I found Sunshine Village to be particularly great as they had plenty of green runs for me to perfect my technique on (a big thanks to Andrew who I’d recommend as an instructor!). I felt like there was a lot of ground for me to cover, but that was only about one third of the resort as the other two thirds have more advanced runs for those with experience. Spending the night up on the mountain was also quite a treat! My room had a fireplace and I also loved the outdoor hot tub and delicious food at the ski-in lodge at Sunshine Village. You can learn more about the ski resorts here. If you are not into skiing or snowboarding there is still plenty to do at the ski resorts. Most of them offer multiple alternative activities. I enjoyed a snowshoe hike after riding the gondola to the top of the lake Louise Ski Resort and Mt. Norquay also has tubing available for most ages. It’s a fun way to get some adrenaline without exerting energy if you’re sore, need a break, or just aren’t that into skiing. I also loved the views from Mt. Norquay and Lake Louise! Probably the most famous lake in Banff national Park, and the one that made me want to visit so badly, is Lake Louise. It ices over in the winter time and turns into a whole different kind of magic. Though the intense blue that made it famous isn’t visible when it’s iced and snowed over, the benefits include a much smaller crowd, a chance to walk on the famous lake, and even to play hockey or ice skate on it. Later on in the winter, they have ice sculptures as well! I just loved taking a walk through Johnston Canyon when it was covered in snow. The waterfalls were mostly frozen as well, which was somehow even more beautiful than when they are flowing. There is a walkway that winds through the Canyon so you can go through without needing snowshoes. It does help to have ice spikes that you can wrap around your boots, but in lieu of that, just to make sure that you’ve got some good tread on your shoes.  If you like rock climbing, or are just curious about what it would be like, then chances are pretty good you’ll love ice climbing too. An axe in each hand and long and lethal spikes on your feet, you start out by learning how to properly walk on the ice and then you get ready to climb. It’s a dance of wedging in the ice axes and stomping the toe of your boot into the ice as you climb ever higher. The satisfaction from getting up there is pretty awesome, and guaranteed you will have sore calves and triceps for days afterwards! I went climbing with Yamnuska Adventures and loved the professionalism of the guide and the quality gear we used. Caving totally brought out my inner child as I crawled and slid down the rocks and mud, rappelling short distances and marveling at the formations in the cave. It was good for my claustrophobia to confront my fear of small spaces, and to find that I actually really enjoyed the feeling of crawling through the tunnels, feeling around in the total darkness when we turned off our headlamps for fun, and warming up in the cave which was nice and insulated on an otherwise absolutely freezing day! I went caving with Canmore Cave Tours, who offer this activity year-round. Just outside of Banff National Park, a 20-30 minute drive away, is the town of Canmore. Just like Banff, it’s surrounded by the rockies and full of absolutely breathtaking photo ops in and outside of town. In contrast to Banff, it’s a bit less touristy but still retains all of the small town charm and friendliness of the area. I loved how many sweeping Rockies views there were from right in town, and enjoyed driving around the breathtaking surroundings as well. Definitely stop by if you’re in the area (I recommend Paintbox lodge for the night)! Those were a few of my favorite adventures while in Banff, which I’m glad to say not only met but exceeded my expectations. The dramatic Rockies, the crystal clear skies, the mounds and mounds of snow, and the limitless amount of activities has me wanting to go back and check out the other seasons too. One thing’s for sure, though: If you want Banff minus the crowds, check it out in the beautiful winter. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Travel Alberta. All thoughts and opinions expressed are my own, always. I love the Chester lake snowshoe it’s so beautiful. I’ve done that same caving adventure too, it’s a ton of fun. We are currently in Canmore. In the Grande Rockies Resort. And we would love to get a guided snowshoeing tour by you. You can contact Yamnuska Adventures for guided snowshoe walks 🙂403-678-4164 I absolutely love Banff! After going to Canada for the first time in 2015 I’m hoping to move there in the next year! Come back in the summertime, too! There are a lot of great hikes in the Banff/Jasper area, not to mention the hot springs, the wild life, and the wildflowers! Also, if you get the chance to see canola fields when they’re blooming (often late June or early July-ish), they are like little oceans of sunshine. 😀 Oooh that sounds so beautiful! I was thinking of the autumn too before there’s too much snowfall. I’d love to see the mountains with just a little dusting of snow and to do some hiking! I would come in September that case. Snow comes pretty early! We might even have snow at that point, in the mountains, to be honest. Haha, we don’t have a lot summer months. I can do September! I heard the larches change and that’s beautiful. I have done Banff in the summer and I loved it but wow it’s also very beautiful in the winter! Wow, I always wanted to do BAMF but never thought about doing it in the winter.  This is seriously making me reconsider! Way less crowded than the summer! I love the Chester lake snow shoe it’s so beautiful. I’ve done that same caving exploration too, it’s fun fulfilling I Love Ice Climbing!!! Recently I went to Canada and challenged myself to learn how to ice climb and it was an amazing experience!!! TRULY SUREAL.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/oeschinen-lake-guide/,"Chasing Waterfalls at Oeschinen Lake, Switzerland",Switzerland,"There is no lake in the world quite the color of Oeschinen Lake (Oeshinensee in German), I’m sure of it. I don’t even know what color to call it, because to say ‘blue’ wouldn’t be getting it right. When you think about how many things in nature are ‘blue’, it seems we’ve failed to come up with enough words to describe this varied color that shows up in millions of iterations. Red is red, and purple is purple, but blue? Gosh there are so many shades, depths to the color, and different ways it can appear based on the mood of the sky. Sometimes blue is that light, bright color that we put on baby bassinets, and other times it’s an alpine lake that has a hue I think you can hardly satisfactorily describe by just calling it blue.  This is Oeschinensee in the canton of Bern, Switzerland. It’s not just a blue lake, though. It has at least a dozen waterfalls, beautiful flowers, swimming options, and row boats for rent as well. Though this lake is popular with locals and tourists, there are still ways to spend most of it uncrowned and even secluded. My goal was to get as close to the waterfalls as possible, as this is also the spot with the fewest other people, and because waterfalls are epic.  there are a few marked trails beginning from the huts that sell ice cream. There’s a beach that most people swim in along the shore there as well, though you could jump in anywhere. There are also little boats for rent for 26 francs, I assume per hour, but if given the choice I like to take my feet. First, if facing the lake take the foot path to the left, walking through the forest and then along the lake on the rocks. And there are waterfalls along the rocky beach trail, marked with rock cairns, that you can walk under, and around, and in. Keep in mind this isn’t really an official trail so it’s best if you have proper shoes on, and are willing to climb on rocks a bit, and even to cross the cold rivers barefoot to keep your feet dry. But if you’re willing to do that, then the best part is waiting. The water was frigid, stabbing me with little needles as I slowly made my way in. I’d broken my own rule – one that had served me well growing up in California where the water is also cold – run in, dunk immediately. Don’t give yourself time to think. Yet without waves there’s nothing to force a dunk, so I crept in slowly, realizing that we’d chosen what must be the coldest part of the lake for a swim. It’s where all the glacial runoff is feeding the lake, after all. Regardless, the brisk and fresh water is so clean, thanks to meltwater that is tens of thousands of years old, plus the nice filtration system provided by the rocks. It’s lovely to think that you could just take a gulp of the water as you swim. That’s the kind of blue it is – clear enough to drink, bright enough to look unreal, and crisp enough to go a step beyond refreshing.  If you want to visit yourself, click here for directions and timetables. But be forewarned: The ongoing problem I, and so many others, have with Switzerland is the more I explore, the longer my list of must-sees grows. The more I visit, the more I am dying to see what other valleys and regions might have to offer. I’m hard-pressed to think of a country that is more organized, cleaner, more beautiful, and nicer to travel through than Switzerland. It’s addictive. All that said, I think that heading to Oeschinen Lake is probably worth the risk. This looks so amazing! You have a knack for finding awesome nature places like this. I’m out of vacation days for the year or I would definitely think about heading down here for a few days 🙁 Next time! Stunning pictures! I have dived into cold water a few times. It definitely takes courage but the reward is great once you leave the water and your body feels refreshing. Wow!! Looks incredible! Is that place even real? I’m going to Switzerland in a couple of weeks, will make sure to add that place to my checklist! 🙂 I have to ask myself all the time if Switzerland is even real. So pretty. I really wanna go to Switzerland soon and that lake is an absolute must-see, wow! I come from Denmark and most of my travels have been overseas. Now I live in Australia and the Australians go to Europe or talk about going to Europe constantly and it has been a bit of an eye-opener for me. When I go back to Denmark next year I really wanna explore more of Europe – Switzerland included! It’s so funny how it takes leaving home to make you want to explore your own backyard huh? Based on my crayola crayons knowledge I would say Cerulean. Beautiful! Amazing. Just recommended this place to my friends in Germany who have their own blog (actually found yours through them a year ago). The water color looks like the gorgeous hue associated with glacial runoff (sometimes even more enhanced by the blue sky) but there is something else going on there that makes it special. Hey Kristin, I’m for a while following you on Instagram and on a regular base reading your posts. It always makes medream about new destinations! This post makes me want to take a plane and go straight to Switzerand! Me and some friends recently started a platform where travel bloggers can share experiences. I know you don’t need the promo since your blog is running perfectly, but if you would ever want to guest blog or share some info, we would be honoured! Amazing pictures and useful information. I love the view of the lake, and I would love to visit one day.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/valle-verzasca-lavertezzo-guide/,"A Guide to Incredible Lavertezzo, Switzerland",Switzerland,"It felt like standing in the Mediterranean sun that day, atop a rock, ready to jump into the clearest water I had ever seen. I thought that photos of Lavertezzo were highly edited, then I saw it for myself and realized that no, this is probably some of the clearest, cleanest water on earth. In this sunny, Italian-speaking area of Switzerland, the cold river running through Lavertezzo is perfection. I visited with Swiss friend of mine, Patrice, whom I met in Mozambique and then again in Austria, and again in Indonesia. We love adventures that involve water and the sun so it seemed only appropriate to form a plan to see some of the places that he hadn’t seen yet (and me neither) in his home country. Lavertezzo seemed perfect. It’s in a warm part of the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, and it had water that looked like this running through it. I ask you, is there a better summer activity? The Valle Verzasca is charming as well, with a small population of around 1350 and little buildings made mostly of stone. While we’re on the topic of stone, the 17th century Roman double arch stone bridge at Ponte dei Salti that runs over this pristine river is one of the biggest draws to the area. If you are in the area, or even if you aren’t, if you’re in Switzerland in the summer do yourself a favor and go here! Here’s how: The nearest train station to the valley is Tenero, and from there you can access a post bus right across the street with a kiosk where you can purchase your ticket for 6.50 Francs. It takes credit cards. Catch bus 321 towards Sonogno and get off at Lavertezzo, Paese. This bus runs infrequently so check timetables on Google maps before you go. We took off from the Zurich area, using public transport to go the whole way. It’s painful, at a total of about 8 hours RT and 155 Francs for the train and bus, but then the rest of the day was totally free, and worth it, I’ll add. You can also save a lot of money by booking the tickets ahead of time instead of last minute like I did.  One of the wonderful things about this river is it’s free in many senses – you don’t have to pay to enjoy it and nobody’s there monitoring what you can and can’t do. The signs on display make it clear that you enjoy at your own risk. The bridge jump is about 15 meters, the rocks are slippery, and the current can be strong. Always make sure that where you’re jumping in is deep and not near a waterfall. It’s also advisable to float feet-first. The current is fast! It’s not rocket science to come out unscathed, though. If you want to hang out right on the river and regularly jump into the water and climb on rocks (and why wouldn’t you?) you’ll be right in the sun. Definitely bring along some sunscreen! I didn’t think of doing so but at a high elevation and in a part of Switzerland that’s known for being sunny, after three hours in the sun I got a bit burned.  there’s not a lot in the village near the river, so might as well bring your own lunch and drinks and make it into a picnic. You’re allowed to do so there, but obviously, clean everything up after yourself. In the future, I’d love to leave some extra time and stay in the area, camping and hiking. I can only imagine how beautiful the surroundings to this old bridge and river are, and how much less crowded it could be as well! But even if you only have a few hours like we did, this valley is incredible. Go for a swim, lay on the rocks, and soak it all in. This is a side of Switzerland I never knew existed. I’m blown away. This looks absolutely amazing! I can’t believe how clear the water is. Is the water pretty cold? Yes it’s cold but I thought it was really nice on a hot day! Such clear waters! And I love how there aren’t too many people. Looks like it was definitely worth the 8 hours of travel 😉 I’ve never seen pictures of this place until now. I feel so left out! But now I’m yearning with everyone else. Also, I love these summer posts about Switzerland you’re doing! Not all mountains and frostbite! Don’t worry I didn’t know about these awesome places until my friend Patrice took me! I think Switzerland must be just perfect in every season. Thank you Kristin! As usual you are such an inspiración to me! Do you think we can do canyoneering in that river? My friends and I are looking for some cool spot for doing out favourite sport! That I’m not sure about. The rocks are pretty slick. Hi,I’m planning a big Europe trip for all of July and I’m dying to get to this little town ever since I saw photos of it from a nature/landscape photographer. Your website is the only one I’ve seen with actual directions on how to get to Lavertezzo – so thank you! But I’m wondering at what time did you leave Zurich to travel for 8 hrs? And then did you spend a night in Lavertezzo? For my own trip, I’m wondering if the 8hr travel time can be done overnight at all because that would help cut down on time and money spent if traveling by day. Looking forward to hearing back – thank you! Sorry for being unclear, it was 8 hours round trip from Zurich, and we left in the late morning. Hey Im going to switzerland end of May! Do you think it will be hot enough to visit and swim here? Each year is different but this is a pretty sunny part of the country. The water is really cold regardless of time of year but still so worth a swim! Hi Kristin,I plan to visit Lavertezzo at the end of January.I just want to see the nice village there. Not swimming:)Do you think, it will be good ?Thanks.Dina I’m sure it will be wonderful, but you might not be able to see the river if it’s covered in snow. Hi Kristin, Any recommendations on where to stay in this area? We really want to go while visiting the country in August. Our next stop would be Lake Como. Is it easy to get there from Lavertezzo? Thanks! Lauren You can get just about anywhere on the train system and it works like clockwork. You can stay in Lavertezzo!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/davos-switzerland-skiing/,"Skiing in Davos, Switzerland: An Alpine Wonderland",Switzerland,"The train chugged along on that crisp February morning and I looked out the window, so happy to be back in the Swiss Alps, and so amazed by how dramatic those mountains always look. I’d been to Switzerland just once before when I followed my late grandmother’s journal there, but that was in the summertime when the wild flowers were in full bloom and sweat formed on my brow as I hiked across from the Matterhorn. The winter would be different – it always is. “Just wait until we go through this tunnel,” the conductor said cheerfully to the group behind me, clutching their skis and snowboards in hope, “and there will be snow.” Just then we passed into the darkness for a few moments and upon emerging back into the light, we found he was right. Like magic, snow was everywhere. I pulled into the station at Davos, a quaint little town with sparkling icicle lights strung from building to building, and alighted with the other skiers to meet a valley framed with mountains all around, and gondolas running in every which direction to take people up to the top. I imagined the view up there must be spectacular. And the next day, I found out that yes, it is. Davos is a special place because while much of the rest of the Alps might have to create their own snow, it’s high in elevation and gets plenty from the sky during the ski season. While I was there we had a mix of snow flurries, blue skies, and billowy clouds. It was the Alpine winter wonderland you imagine and hope for when you picture what a perfect ski holiday might look like. Let’s talk about the cost. Switzerland is expensive, that’s true. You’ll spend a lot on food and lodging. The lift tickets and the quality of the runs, however, beat out the US and Canada easily, where it’s just as much if not more expensive. When I was in Idaho this winter a lift ticket cost $140. In Davos, it’s half of that (you can also get it cheaper by prepaying online), and includes 5 ski areas: Parsenn, Pischa, Madrisa, Rinerhorn, and Jakobshorn. Plus for skiing, I want lots of real snow. Parsenn is the largest ski area in Davos with 35 runs and these absolutely stunning surroundings. It’s also the most modern with the funicular, plenty of chair lifts, and gondolas. Apart from the runs, several of which are over 10km combined (which I think is too cool!), there’s also an igloo village that you can ski into and stay in for as little as 150 francs per night per person. It has a hot tub, sauna, and fondue. ‘Nuff said. This mountain has one gondola that runs up every 30 minutes, and is loved for the snow-shoeing, off-piste (un-groomed slopes) skiing, and activities like air boarding and fat biking. I fell off of my fat bike within the first three minutes and opted for air boarding after that, which is basically a little blow up pool floaty that you lay face-first on and charge down the mountain. As an added bonus, my abs are still sore from it two days later. It’s always the best when you don’t even realize you’re getting a workout, you’re having so much fun. I loved the Rinerhorn for the view, the smaller crowds, and for being the first place where I learned to embrace the T-bar lift. While the mountain has runs in every color and suited to every level, I really appreciated the variety of blue and red runs that I was able to do with ease, some running through the trees and through truly beautiful scenery. They also have a sledding track that you can do during the day or at night. Believe it or not you should bring your helmet and goggles along – it’s like Mario Kart on snow. You’ll be careening down the mountain with serious speed. It’s awesome! While I didn’t get to ski at Jakobshorn — I had a flight to catch — the blue run pictured above had me swearing that I had to go back and ski this mountain, because I mean really, just look at it. Plus, there’s a hut at the top, Jatzhütte, with a fun park out front to watch the talented skiiers and snowboarders do tricks, a sauna, a hot tub, and a rocking full moon party. It doesn’t get much better than chilling with a palm tree in, what I was told, is the highest hot tub in the Alps. I was surprised by how much the lift passes include, such as an early morning ski experience, which allows you to be the very first person on the slopes, a ski safari along one of the 12km runs, snow shoe adventures, cross country taster sessions, a chance to learn about the grooming and rescue operations, and options for kids and families as well. That’s something that every other ski resort I’ve been to would charge for. I also hit up an ice hockey game, tried out ice skating for myself (and never let go of the little ice penguin that helped me stay upright, truth be told), and spent an entire day out snow-shoeing to a local waterfall: I also loved the conditions on the slopes, with nice, soft snow that was easy to learn on. So far, it’s been my best skiing experience, which is probably due largely to my technique improving with more practice, but it also has to do with the quality of the snow and the availability of lots of ski runs. So thanks, Davos, for introducing me to winter so high up in the Alps and with such lovely powder. I’ll be back again.  Stay:  Davos is a classy ski town with mostly four and five-star hotels. I personally stayed at Morosani Posthotel which has three restaurants and even a nightclub downstairs, but the rooms themselves are warm, charming, and nice and quiet. It seems like it would be a huge hotel, but it’s small and intimate. It’s also in a great location, very close to a bus pick up (which is nice when you’re walking in ski boots, carrying skis!) and is also located at the base of Jakobshorn, and a stone’s throw from the train station. Eat:  I ate almost exclusively at Morosani, all of which was delicious, particularly Pöstli which is a grill with tender meats, a great wine selection, and to-die-for beef carpaccio. Get in and around: It takes about 3 hours from Zurich airport to Davos via Landquart through some stunning scenery (it is Switzerland, after all). Once in Davos, it’s super easy to get around, even to areas that seem remote, thanks to the free and reliable busses. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Davos and Visit Switzerland. Thoughts and reviews are my own – the slopes are seriously awesome. This looks incredible! I love that you have begun to visit many winter destinations! My dream is to live in the mountains…hopefully someday! I’d love a beach bungalow and a mountain hut. Goals! So if you didn’t have a car to get around, it would be easy once you got into town to make your way to all the different ski areas? Cause if I went, obviously I would want to try as many as possible. European public transport is so much better than America’s! Yes the bus and train system is great. I didn’t have a car. WOW! I want to go so bad! What are red runs though? I am an intermediate/advanced skier…..could I do this place justice? And can you give a ballpark total cost on the trip per person? A red is like a blue in North America. It goes blue, red, black in Europe. I’ve never seen a green there. Price totally depends on where you stay and what you eat! Lift passes are fair I think, though.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/where-to-hike-in-zermatt-switzerland/,Nobody Told Me Switzerland is So Beautiful,Switzerland,"For the final stop on Mom and my journey following my Grandmother’s journal around Europe, we continued along the Alps and landed in Zermatt, Switzerland. Why didn’t anyone tell me before that Switzerland is so dang beautiful? This was the place Granny went into the most detail about regarding the landscape. She branched off from the group one day to explore the Matterhorn surroundings on her own, noting that the guide “hadn’t done his homework” (Mom and I couldn’t stop laughing about that, reading it to ourselves in her voice) by telling her it would be a waste of time to take a train, the Gornergrat, up to it. The train she referenced is pretty touristy now, so that was a big change from 30 years ago when Granny took it pre-fame. Mom put the veto on that idea pretty quickly given she’s been in Zermatt before and knew it was both pricey, at about $100 per person, and way too crowded these days. Instead, we opted to go for a hike, just like we’d done in Heidelberg, Innsbruck, and Ahrntal in the days before. It was mid-July and a hot one at that. Mom had been there just a year before around the same time and they were wearing gloves and winter jackets, but this time around, we were sweating in the hot sun and the Matterhorn had just a bit of snow left at the top. I can’t decide which is better. Perhaps a little something in between? What immediately made me fall in love were the wild flowers. They were just about every color one might paint a baby’s room from white to yellow, purple, pink, and blue. The hike can start from the town of Zermatt itself but Mom and I were staying at a cute guest house a gondola ride up at the Hotel Silvana in Furi. The trail goes through Zmutt, then Stafelalp, followed by Schwarzsee. (Get a good map before you set out hiking) After a few miles of flatness you’ll come to a steep climb upwards that will peak with an incredible view of the Matterhorn. It’s a bit of a challenge but not too bad. Shortly thereafter, another guesthouse along the way called Hotel du Trift is the perfect spot for an apfelschorle (apple juice and sparkling water mixed together – a favorite of mine ever since moving to Germany) and soup with sausage in it. The owner teased us mercilessly for coming inside when it started to sprinkle a bit outside. I liked him. The hike involves a lot of ups and downs from there, and, it depends on which way you go whether you take the gondola back down to Zermatt, or in our case stay higher up since we were staying just next to the gondola. Mom was a bit winded from the hike and I have to admit it was a long and somewhat challenging, but beautiful and rewarding, one. In total we hiked about 12 miles (19.3 km), in the summer heat. Our final stop of Switzerland and therefore our trip was the Stellisee, a lake that, when completely flat and on a clear day, mirrors the Matterhorn. This famous lake is a photographer’s dream when the conditions are right, and especially at sunrise as it creates a mirror for the Matterhorn. If you want to catch that, stay at the top at Fluhalp or look into camping. We, however, made a day trip out of it. Unless you want to take several hours to do the very the steep climb, take the funicular Zermatt near the train station to Sunnegga, then the gondola to Blauherd. From there you can either take a higher, more challenging hike to Stellisee or the flatter, short one. We accidentally aimed higher and it was steep but rewarding just the same. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jul 7, 2015 at 1:13pm PDT  The lake wasn’t flat that day, but I still thought it was quite beautiful, if not a bit over-popular for me. We stayed at the Hotel Silvana, which is a family-run joint (seriously the son is a carbon copy of the dad) owned by the brother of the guy who owns Hotel du Trift. Mom picked this hotel since she had stayed a few times before (she is a Zermatt enthusiast) and she picked well. I liked this place because it was cute and peaceful, had a nice breakfast spread, and the dinner each night consisted of four delicious, meaty courses and cost about $45 per person, and a beer was around $8. That would be expensive for anywhere other than Switzerland, where a burger at a restaurant back down on the main drag was $20. Seriously. It turned out to be a much better value, plus way more peaceful, eating at the Hotel Silvana than it was down below in Zermatt, especially given the increased activity since it was just a week prior to the 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn at the time. Overall, I was truly impressed by Switzerland and if it didn’t cost an arm and a leg to travel there, would probably spend a lot longer exploring and trekking through the Alps. One day, when money is no object, I’m sure I will do just that. Thanks Granny, for taking us around the Alps with you. Until the next chapter, I think of you always. What beautiful pictures ! And it’s really great to be able to follow your grandmother’s travel 30 years later, very cool way to plan a trip. I am so ashamed that I am so close (Geneva) but never made it to Zermatt and the Matterhorn..! There’s a lot of cool stuff near the places that I’ve lived that I never even knew about so don’t feel bad! Ha, love that “This is for your Pinterest board” note. I had been thinking “wow, Instagram gold” then I came to that other one haha. Anyway, I’ve always reserved Switzerland for the “one day when I have a lot of money” destinations but this is just so incredibly beautiful. Loving the Granny series a lot Kristin. Hope all is amazing, looks like it! Might as well make it easy! Been loving Pinterest lately. Funny thing is I think of traveling Oz “one day when I have more money.” It’s about picking and choosing and doing what you can I guess! I spent a few days in Switzerland 10 years ago with my family around Lake Montreux and I remember also being blown away by its unexpected beauty. This definitely makes me want to go back and do some more hiking! 🙂 I want to go back and do more too! Riding through more of the country on the train only reinforced that. It was the only place I’ve been, really, in Switzerland and it made quite an impressive initial impression I love this post! It’s definitely food for thought after seeing those photos and the hikes sound awesome! I need some more mountains in my life 🙂 P.S, loving your new layout! Thanks so much! It was in the works for a long time and I’m happy with the way it turned out. I need more mountains in my life too. That was in July and I’m missing them already! I have been to europe many times but have not made it to Switzerland yet. I will make sure this will be my first stop next time I go and this is in no small part thanks to you. Fabulous photos and articles. Keep up the awesome work. That’s awesome! It really is so breathtaking. Great pics and great read.People should be ashamed for not telling you how amazingly beautiful Switzerland is.It’s my favorite European country and it mostly has to do with its beauty.I could easily go back there every year.But daaaaaaamn it’s an expensive little place. Beautiful!Do you think I’m crazy if I go hiking alone in Zermatt? It’s pretty busy so I think if you pick a popular trail it’s ok!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-itinerary/,Patagonia Itineraries for One Week to One Month,Chile,"So you want to visit Patagonia, but have a limited amount of time to work with? No problem, because there’s still a way to see the highlights even in limited time. I traveled through Patagonia from February through March and took it slowly, trying to explore as much of the region as possible while working simultaneously. Some people I met had even longer in Patagonia than I did, but most were on shorter trips and had to pick and choose what they saw. That got me thinking about what I would have prioritized had I been working with less time, and with that in mind, I put together three different Patagonia itineraries for those with one week, two weeks, or one month to travel with. (Note: If you have more time and want to retrace my journey, start with the archives or Bariloche in the Argentina guide and follow the chronological blog posts, all of which have directions and advice.) This information is for those who want to self-guide their own tour of Patagonia, since I’m all about independent travel and take tours only when they offer a glimpse into something I can’t access or understand as well on my own. As Patagonia is all about the outdoors, these itineraries prioritize hiking and camping, two must-dos in Patagonia. Before you go, be sure to read my camping and packing guides before you go as well, because certain weather-resistant equipment is essential when in Patagonia, even during their summer! Jump to: One week isn’t a ton of time in Patagonia, but if you maximize it right, you can hit many of the highlights. This itinerary is packed to the brim and will have you constantly on the move. If you want to take it a bit easier, I have some alternative suggestions at the bottom of the itinerary to help you pick and choose how much you want to see and move around. If you can swing it, though, don’t miss Torres del Paine National Park! Here’s a map with all of the important stops for one week in Patagonia:  Day 1: Fly into El Calafate from Buenos Aires (or do this itinerary in the reverse and fly into Punta Arenas if you’re already in Chile). Take 3-hour shuttle directly to El Chalten (order ahead of time if high season). A ticket should cost you AR $600. Here are some of the bus companies available and their schedule: (Click for places to stay in El Chalten). Day 2:  Hike to the Cerro Torre – an 18km, easy hike to one of the most dazzling rock formations in the park. Dinner at B&B burgers or order Cordero Patagonico (local lamb on a spit), dessert at Domo Blanco ice cream. Day 3:  Wake up before sunrise and hike to the Condor Lookout, 20-minute hike. Hike from town to the Fitz Roy, dinner in town. Day 4:  Early morning bus to El Calafate. Again, a ticket costs AR $600, and here are the bus companies available and their schedule: (Click here for places to stay in El Calafate). Buy onward ticket to Puerto Natales. Bus ticket should costs about AR $1100 – AR $1300 Check in and visit the Perito Moreno Glacier. If in a duo or group, it’s cheaper and more convenient to order a taxi for a flat fee. Ask your guesthouse to call for you. Otherwise, busses depart from the bus terminal in town from 8am to 4pm. Day 5: Early AM bus to Puerto Natales (the journey takes about 5 hours). Book bus to Torres del Paine National Park at the bus terminal following AM (book ahead if high season). (Click for where to stay in Puerto Natales) Day 6:  Early AM bus to Torres del Paine National Park. The journey should take less than 2 hours. Alight at Hotel Las Torres² and hike up to the Torres. Hike back down to take the bus back to Puerto Natales in the afternoon (note: this is a challenging hike to do in one day, consider taking a horse partway if needed). Day 7: Full Paine tour departing and returning to Puerto Natales. Bus next AM back to El Calafate and fly out from there, keeping in mind that the border crossing will take time. *Optional changes:   Here’s a map with all of the important stops for two weeks in Patagonia: Day 1: Fly into El Calafate from Buenos Aires (or do this itinerary in the reverse and fly into Punta Arenas if you’re already in Chile). Take 3-hour shuttle directly to El Chalten (order ahead of time if high season). A ticket should cost you AR $600. Here are some of the bus companies available and their schedule: (Click for places to stay in El Chalten). Day 2: Rent in the town or carry your own camping gear up to the base of the Fitz Roy and explore the surroundings. Spend the night camping. Day 3:  Hike to the base of the Fitz Roy, come back down and pack up your tent, and then hike to the Cerro Torre. Either camp at the base of the Cerro Torre or walk back into town (it’ll be a long day!) for the night. Day 4:  If back in town, wake up before the sun rises and check out the Condor Lookout for the sunrise on the mountains, the famed rocks from the Patagonia brand label. Bus in the afternoon to El Calafate. Again, a ticket costs AR $600, and here are the bus companies available and their schedule: (Click here for places to stay in El Calafate). Buy onward ticket to Puerto Natales. Day 5:  Visit the Perito Moreno Glacier. If in a duo or group, it’s cheaper and more convenient to order a taxi for a flat fee. Ask your guesthouse to call for you. Otherwise, busses depart from the bus terminal in town from 8am to 4pm. Day 6:  Early AM bus to Puerto Natales (the journey takes about 5 hours). Use the time in the afternoon to rent camping gear if needed, stock up on food, and get ready to hike the W trek, a 5-day trek in Torres del Paine National Park (Everything you need to know to prepare is listed here). Purchase bus tickets from the bus terminal (or online) for the first bus out the following morning. (Click for where to stay in Puerto Natales) Days 7-12:  Take the bus from Puerto Natales to Torres del Paine National Park in the morning (bus departs from 7AM to 11:30AM, and journey should take less than 2 hours). Trek the W in Torres del Paine, including Glacier Grey, the French Valley, and the Torres. When finished on day 5, take the bus back into Puerto Natales. Day 13-14:  Take a bus to Punta Arenas and visit the Penguins in the afternoon or early the next morning. Fly out of Punta Arenas to Santiago. *Optional changes: You have a whole month in Patagonia? Applause! This is enough time to do some of the treks that others don’t often do who are on tighter schedules and want to see the highlights. The lesser-known places in Patagonia are some of the most magical, so with that in mind, this itinerary prioritizes the lesser-known areas along with the more popular ones. Here’s a map with all of the important stops for one week in Patagonia: Note: This can be just as easily done in the reverse. Days 1-4:  More Active: Fly into Bariloche, Argentina, and pick an overnight hike. Two enjoyable ones I tried were the Cerro Tronador and Refugio Frey. (Click here for great places to stay in Bariloche). Less Active: Take the bus from town and do a shorter hike to the Cerro Campanario and drive the Route of the 7 Lakes. Check out my Bariloche guide for the specifics on all of the hikes, how to navigate the area, and where to stay and what to eat. Days 5-15: This is where the path can change significantly from the usual highlights which are in both of the one and two-week itineraries, or go for something different. Take a look at the above to see what the usual popular suspects (and rightfully so!) and decide if they deserve a lot of time, because the alternative is a lot of parks mostly locals visit and know about, and it’s pretty darn cool. Travel down the Carretera Austral, South America’s most remote road, via private rental car (fastest), hitchhiking, or busses (which are infrequent and ever-changing, so leave a time cushion when using this method). It’s also possible to bicycle, but this would most likely take up the entire month. Sights (Click the links for photos and info on each): Days 16-18: Walk from Chile into Argentina. It’s a total of 22km and you’ll be in no-man’s land for most of it. One of the coolest trails in Patagonia. (Note: You can often hire horses to carry the bags, but it’s not possible to book ahead. In case you have to carry all of your stuff, pack light! Suggestions here.) Days 19-21: Do day hikes around El Chalten to the Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre, or if you want a challenge and to devote more time to this, check out the Huemul Circuit. While it’s one of the toughest hikes in the area, it’s also one of the least-trekked and most impressive with sweeping views of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. (Click for places to stay in El Chalten). Days 22-30: Depending on how much time you have left, make your way through El Calafate to Puerto Natales and gear up for Torres del Paine. (Click here for places to stay in El Calafate). Choose to do the full O circuit or the W, depending on time. Regardless of the amount of time you have or how much of a hiker you are, the good news is Patagonia is so full of incredible things to see, you can’t really make a bad choice in regards to what to see. You can, however, make a bad choice regarding prep, so make sure you bring the right gear and clothing along with you! Patagonia is a beautiful and rugged place. Enjoy every moment of it! Thank you so much for this post! Patagonia has been at the top of my bucket list for a long time, and I’ll admit I was a bit stymied on how to visit and what to see. You make the planning process a lot easier for me 😀 woah!!!!! I wish I could stay in Patagonia for 1 month. amazing views!!!thanks for sharing. Just booked my almost 3 week trip to Patagonia and a friend tipped me off to your blog – excellent info! One question though – everything else I’ve read regards Puerto Natales as the base camp of Torres del Paine, with Punta Arenas for penguin sightings. Yours seems to indicate the opposite. Why do you prefer Punta Arenas over Puerto Natales for the base camp? It seems like the bus to PA from El Calafate would be much father than to PN. Wow you are totally and completely right! I never could get those two straight in my mind. I was confusing the two constantly (and still do, clearly). It’s kind of like when I look at a 24-hour clock and without fail I will read “15:35” as 5:35pm rather than 3:35pm. Ugh! Thanks so much for saying something and I’ve fixed it in the itinerary now! Thanks so much for letting me know! I was quite confused haha 🙂 If you are going hiking to Torres del Paine I would recommed you to first go to Punta Arenas to buy the food its a 10 minutes drive from the airport. Puerto Natales its really expensive compare with Punta Arenas, from there you can take a bus to Puerto Natales and buy Argentinian pesos believe me you dont want to use an ATM in Argentina they charge you around 10 dollars for use in addition of what your bank charge you Or just get Charles Schwab and they will refund the ATM fees. How current is your info? The black market for Argentinian pesos is dead now Hi Kristin, My wife and I are trying to plan a trip using your 1 week schedule as a guideline because we will be doing something like 7-10 days.  For the one week trip, would there be camping or does this plan on staying in hostels or hotels? We want to do some camping but I was not sure if it was part of the plan or if the plan is more stay in a city and do hikes from the base. Thanks,Matt  P.S. My wife loves your site. Thought I should add that I like your site too. You can camp if you want to! These aren’t cities, per se. They are tiny towns and all have campsites. You can also do overnights out on the trails – there are campsites all over the ones in El Chalten, for example. Thank you for the response. I took a little bit of the 1 week and 2 week itinerary notes and came up with a plan in el chalten for some camping on trails and some staying in town. It’s good to know that camping close to town is also an option.   I really liked the pictures of the glacier hike you did in chile but don’t think we can make it there in our timeline.  Did you hear much about the glacier tours for the glacier by El Calafate? I also went to Perito Moreno in El Calafate and you don’t need to take a tour unless you want to. You can bus in, then hire a taxi for a fixed rate who will take you and wait for you then bring you back to town when you’re done. It’s a better option as long as there are 2 or more of you. It was super impressive! Hi Kristin! Thanks for the great post! I am a female solo traveler and will be heading to Argentina in January. I was originally planning on 19-20 days in the Patagonia, but am considering shifting some things around to only spend 16 there. A friend of mine recommended spending a weekend in Punta Del Este to get some beach time in (should be fun over NYE). I will be in Buenos Aires studying Spanish for the month prior to going to the Patagonia, so I have some flexibility on when I go to the Falls. I will have everything I need to hike before flying south so I won’t need to spend a day preparing before hand. However, if you think this schedule will be too rushed, I could go to Iguazu earlier in trip and possibly skip punta del este, which would give me several more days in the Patagonia. What do you think? Day 1: Fly Calafate (5am flight), bus Torre Del PaineDay 2 – 9: O circuitDay 10: RelaxDay 11: Bus CalafateDay 12: Big Ice TrekDay 13: Early Bus to El Chalten, day hikeDay 14: Day hikeDay 15: Day hikeDay 16: Bus Calafate, Fly IguazuDay 17: Falls- BrazilDay 18: FallsDay 19: FallsDay 20: Fly BA Also, I plan to camp the whole time in the Patagonia except for two days at the end of the O circuit, in which I’ll stay in a hotel. Do I need to reserve a spot at a free campsite if I am carrying all of my gear? Thank you!!-Ash Give the O a solid 8 days, and that’s if you’re fit. Otherwise that looks pretty good to me! Yes if this is in January definitely book ahead of time as it will fill up. Hi there, My wife and I are going to Patagonia for our honeymoon in the last 2 weeks of December. We are using your 2-week itinerary as a rough guide: flying into El Calafate, then straight to El Chalten for 2 days, then back to El Calafate for 1.5 days, then to Puerto Natales as a launching point to Torres del Paine to hike the W trek for 5 days. After that, we have about 5 days left and we’re debating what to do:1. Go up north to Bariloche and/or Puerto Rio Tranquilo; or2. Go down south to Ushuaia, maybe stop in Punta Arenas on the way. After we do (1) or (2) above, we need to get back to El Calafate, where we fly out of in order to head home. We are more into hiking vs. tourist attractions; being on our own vs. being with the crowd. It’s a bit hard to tell how doable it is to get from Puerto Natales to either of those destinations. Which do you think we should do – (1) or (2)? Are both feasible in terms of travel? If so, how would you recommend we get from Puerto Natales to (1)/(2)? Thanks in advance for you advice! I would give El Chalten more time instead of trying to book it to one of the other spots. Puerto Rio Tranquilo can take a while, but you can fly into and out of Bariloche. Why do you need to go back to El Calafate from there? I assume you’re flying in and out of Buenos Aires? Awesome! 🙂 This is so helpful! I am going to Chile with my boyfriend in March. We want to send 4-6 days camping or hiking in the patagonias. We will becoming from Santiago and flying into Punta Arenas. Would you suggest we spend the whole time in Torres del Paine hiking and camping here or try to make it toEl Chaltén as well. my concern is it will be hard to get from Chalten back to santiago the flights are expansive and 5 hours. Thanks for your help I’d pick one spot with only a few days or you’ll be rushed and stressed. Thanks for this, Kristin! I have fourteen days with two travel days and am struggling to choose between northern and southern Patagonia. Which do you think? Or is there a way to see some of both in that time?Kelly You could do Bariloche for a bit then fly down to El Calafate. I think down south is more impressive. so helpful thank you!  How much money would you suggest budgeting for the one-week itinerary (buses, meals, lodging, any entrance fees)? Here’s my breakdown: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-trip-cost/ Thank you for posting such helpful information! We’ll be spending 7 nights (6 full days) between El Calafate and El Chalten. We’re planning to just do a day tour of Torres del Paine from El Calafate as we won’t have enough time to do a long hike. But, would you recommend we spend a night at Hotel Las Torres to give us another day in the park?  We are also debating if we should spend more time in El Calafate vs. El Chalten. Do you prefer one over the other? Thanks again! Definitely prefer El Chalten over El Calafate, by far! I think another day in the park is a good idea too if you can do it. It’s so beautiful. You might have more success in Chile when you’re getting ready to do the Torres del Paine circuit. The backpacker accommodation are used to keeping bags there and didn’t charge me to do so. I didn’t do anything but the glacier and didn’t love the town either. It’s really touristy!  There could be hikes I wasn’t aware of, though. If you find some please let me know! Great site! Thanks for all the information… I may have missed it in the comments or actual post but, Do you have a general budget for the iteneraries? Got it here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-trip-cost/ Hi,  I’ve a very short period of time on this trip. From 29th oct to 1st nov. I’m thinking to fly to Punta Arenas.1st daydo day tour trekking to the base Torres,  2nd day,Will do full day (easy hike) tour Torres Del Paine.   Do you think we re really need to get a tour for my second day? Both tour exclude the park entrance fee. Do you think I need to pay twice for both day or one time?  3rd dayWill take a bus from Puerto Natales to El Calafate.   4th dayMay I know if I’m going to the Perito Moreno by myself, NO tour, how much is the boat ride? I heard it’s a must and impressive.  Thank you. 1st day looks good, the second day I would do a full paine bus tour to see the beautiful and iconic stuff in the park. Most of it would require multiple days to trek to otherwise. They usually return you to town as well. I don’t know about the park entrance fee. I’d ask the tour company that you book with.  I also don’t know how much the boat tour is, I didn’t do one. Hi Kate You only pay once to Torres del Paine National Park Fees, when you leave the park the first day saves the ticket and will serve you for the next day We are a couple 61 and 58 who travel with our 20 year old son.  We are big hikers but thinking would prefer not to camp and carry all the needed gear.  (Backpack camping gets less appealing as we get older.)  Staying in hostels/private rooms with an occasional nice hotel.  Say 80% hiking and 20% culture/small town tourism. We would rent a car when it makes sense to be time efficient.  No hitch hiking, bus is fine if it goes where/when we want.  Thinking 3 weeks including travel time.  Probably looking for a little more granular trip planning advice than you give away on your blog  (but not to the booking level).  Suggestions on travel reading…Loved reading about your trip and watching the video’s. Hey Scott, I wrote everything about my trip and everything I know on here! I gave it all away! 🙂Since I didn’t rent a car I don’t have that info but it is a bit expensive, I do know that, but probably worth it for your trip. Where you go and how you spend that time will depend on how long you want to devote to each place and that’s something you’d have to decide for yourself, but El Chalten seems like a perfect fit given it has plenty of day hikes. You might like Steve’s guidebooks as well: http://amzn.to/2oNLn7R, http://amzn.to/2nrWFyf Hi,  loved your article huge help for planning my trip! Just wondering where your opening photo is from?Thanks The Huemul Circuit: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/huemul-circuit-argentina/ Hi Connie, Thanks for asking. Torre just means ‘tower’ so it’s a name that a few rock formations down there have. However thank you for calling my attention to it because I think that only the one in Argentina has a ‘cerro’ in front of it. These names are endlessly confusing for me! Made a change in the post now to reflect that.  The reason why I suggest flying into Puerto Natales is the airport in Punta Arenas is much smaller and probably super expensive if it’s even doing flights atm since they only do in high season, but check with SKY airlines to make sure. The demand is high to get to Torres del Paine lately so maybe they’re doing more flights.  El Calafate is just the most logical place to fly into because it’s in the middle, between Torres del Paine and El Chalten, plus you have the perito moreno glacier there and lots of day trips to Torres del Paine too. That said, you will pay a lot more to fly from Santiago into El Chalten because flights within the country are reasonable but as soon as you cross a border they tend to triple. Can you fly into Buenos Aires from Canada instead? It’s also a super cool city! Hi Kristen: Thank you so much for you detailed reply. Yes Buenos Aires is in my plan but it turns out flying to Santiago from Canada is much cheaper than flying to Buenos Aires. That’s why I thought I can see the Patagonia on the Chile side before heading to Buenos Aires. And yes the names are very confusing to me and thanks for clarifying. I guess you meant hiking in the Torres del Paine on Day 7 instead of hiking to the Cerro Torres? I have approx 3 weeks (more or less) for my trip to South America and here’s my tentative plan: 1) Fly into Santiago, stay there for 4-5 nights.2) Fly to Buenos Aires, then fly El Calafate on the same day (is it possible?)3) Stay in El Calafate overnight take the shuttle bus to El Chalten next AM.4) Hike to the Cerro Torres next day5) Condor Lookout next day6) Day tour to the Torres del Paine7) take a shuttle back to El Calafate next day and fly back to Buenos Aires on the same day (possible too?)8) Stay in Buenos Aires for 4-5 nights9) fly back to Santiago and then fly back to Canada  Is this a realistic plan? In a nutshell my plan is in about 3 weeks I would visit Santiago, El Chalten, and Buenos Aires. Santiago will be my base for flying in and out of South America. I’m just unsure if I should attempt the above itinerary or do Santiago –> Buenos Aires –> El Chalten instead. Would you mind sharing your 2 cents?  Many thanks again. Looks good! If you can psych yourself out enough to do Condor and Fitz Roy on the same day then do. I have no idea about the flights that just depends on what’s available. Have fun! Let us know how it goes for you. HI Kristin: Haha thanks for the tip about Condor and Fitz Roy! I’ll definitely keep that in mind if I’m not super tired from moving around. (I’m relatively fit but flying up and down and moving around is another story.)  Will definitely keep you posted if I eventually make it there.  Thank you so much for all your posts – very helpful and reassuring for a fellow female traveller who loves to go solo. You’re definitely one of my fav travel bloggers.  Connie Hi Kristin: So I did make my trip happen and I’m leaving for South America soon! (Peru and Argentina – I gave up Chile because I caught a super cheap flight deal to Peru by fluke.) I have a random question I hope it’s the right place to ask you here: I just bought Pacsafe bag protector, after reading your travel resources on your blog. In your experience, do airlines accept the protector for check-in backpacks?  Many thanks,Connie Hi Kristin Have enjoyed reading your blog. I’m an Aussie solo female traveller planning a trip to Patagonia mid Nov – mid Dec. I’ll have a month.  I have a couple of questions: – Were there lots of people on the route from O’Higgins, boat ride and hike to El Chalten? ie if I’m travelling solo will there be people to hike with? If I fly into Bariloche I’d be keen to take that route, but reading different posts some people say it’s v isolated, so I was just wondering what you think. – I’m keen on the Huemul Circuit: would you recommend organising it with a guide/group rather than doing it solo? The river crossing with the harness and that steep drop look fun but not sure I want to do that on my own! – Have you been down to Ushuaia? Would you recommend it? I was maybe thinking of flying into El Calafate and out of Ushuaia instead of exploring further north.  ThanksImogen Not that many from O’Higgins but it’s more of a dirt road than a treacherous hike and you might meet people at the farm or in town before you even go.I would not do the Huemul circuit solo but I wouldn’t do a guide either because I usually prefer to go at my own pace. I would look for people at hostels in town and see if they want to come 🙂I have not been to Ushuaia sadly. Thanks Kirstin Yeah, I think I’ll be fine. Reading more about the Carreterra Austral – I get the feeling I won’t be the only one doing the crossing 🙂  It’s good to see there are still places you can hitch-hike! My last hitch-hiking adventure was around Newfoundland in 2009. I had THE best time.  Just booked the trip – from Esquel to Ushuaia for a month. Very excited. CheersImogen Hi Kristin, Your site is pretty amazing. It gives me many ideas to plan our holiday.We are planning to do some trekking in Patagonia late November – early December (I hope not too cold) this year. We will try to do something like you wrote in your one-month-itinerary. It sounds amazing as we are relatively experienced trekkers and looking for remote areas to avoid the crowd but still don’t want to miss the typical Patagonian landscapes. I’m little bit worried about the costs, though. We will be on low budget because the flight from and back to Europe takes a lot of money.   We would really love to take this car trip on the Carretera Austral, but I think a car rental could make the whole trip too expensive. If we hitchhike or wait for busses it could take too long and there is a great risk that we have to skip some beautiful treks or we miss our flight back.  What do you suggest? Do you know any car rental companies that allow us to pick up and drop the car in different places? In which cities would you rent and return the car? I thought about Puerto Montt and O’Higgins. Do you know the approx. daily rental cost? Are there any other costs like tunnels or ferries between these cities?  After we dropped our car and we are already in Argentina: Which is the best way to travel between El Chaltén and El Calafate and how to get from there to Torres del Paine? Thank you in advance!Attila You’re right that it will be expensive to rent a car on the Carretera Austral, especially if you drop it off in a different location than you pick up. I don’t have any idea how much since I didn’t do it or where you can drop off but these are tiny towns so options are probably pretty limited. There are buses now and then but they aren’t daily and sometimes they are full when they pass by. Unfortunately that’s just how it is, though you can bypass the Carretera Austral and take a bus through Argentina down to El Chalten instead. The bus directions are noted in the itinerary for how to get from place to place, including TdP. When I didn’t hitchhike I took buses. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I am also a female solo traveler. Just started travelling solo couple years ago. I am planning to go for 2 week trip in Patagonia. I was wondering if it is possible to do multiple day hikes in Torres Del Paine from a hotel in that region. I am not a camp person so not planning to do O or W trek. Not planning to rent a car either. Are there buses from hotels that go to TDP park? Thanks,Bhavna In that case I’d suggest staying at a hotel within the park. The Hotel Las Torres is great. The hotels aren’t cheap, but otherwise, you’d kind of have to learn to be a camp person. It’s not so bad! Hello,I was planning to do Patagonia on my round the world trip- I’m a 25 year old solo traveller- however since it is going to be my first time there I don’t think I’ll be able to manage hiking or camping by myself? Any ideas on how to keep costs lower when travelling there? I’d like to have a guide for hikes:-\  I haven’t gone camping before and the idea of being left alone somewhere intimidates me. Tours even independent ones are crazy expensive – so if I follow the  2 week itinerary you’re mentioning above how easy i s it to find someone to hike with etc? Thanks,Kate Honestly there were so many other people on the trails that I mention in the 2-week itinerary, you won’t be alone at all. I also made friends with plenty of people in town and during the hikes, which was a pleasant part of the journey! I was there with Steve, but I met a solo female traveler who had hitchhiked all the way down the Carretera Austral (mentioned in some of my other Patagonia posts and in this one in the longer itinerary) and I kept running into her, having meals with her, and camping with her. The trails are really obvious so I don’t personally believe a guide is necessary. You can always show up and see what you think! Kristen, how did you handle airline tickets from Buenos Aires to El Calafate? After I booked, I noticed some text about fares applying only for residents. Will I need to pay extra at the airport? Thanks!!! I didn’t have any issues, personally, when I did the reverse.  On the off chance that you are going climbing to Torres del Paine I would recommend you to first go to Punta Arenas to purchase the nourishment its a 10 minutes drive from the airplane terminal. Puerto Natales its truly costly contrast and Punta Arenas, from that point you can take a transport to Puerto Natales and purchase Argentinian pesos trust me, you dont need to utilize an ATM in Argentina they charge you around 10 dollars for use moreover of what your bank charge you This is great information! We are considering a 1-2 week trip with our young adult daughters.  Can you give me any sense of what kind of costs we could expect for these itineraries?  Also is it possible to do it without any camping if we don’t want to haul a full pack?  Thank you!! Here you go! Some campsites do have tents set up that you can rent but most will not https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-trip-cost/ Good Afternoon Kristin, I have a long trip not at all planned in Patagonia and I’m looking for some advice. I’m flying into Puerto Arenas and then doing the O circuit at Torres del Paine. I am on my own and after the Torres del Paine trek I have around two weeks. Do you think it is worth making my way up the Carretera Austral or is that not quite enough time? What would you advice in terms of renting a car in the area? Thanks, Matthew Hi Matthew,  I spent two weeks doing it myself. It would be hard if you hitchhike but if you rent a car it could work out well! I didn’t rent a car myself but I found this forum and this looks like good advice: https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294291-i1357-k10066750-Renting_a_car_to_drive_Carretera_Austral-Chile.html Thanks for the response! Where did you finish/start your trip, Puerto Montt? Bariloche then took a bus to Puerto Montt from there, yes! Hello – I am a solo female traveler that will be going to Patagonia.  I will have my own sleeping bag and tent and carry my own food and plan to do the O circuit at Torre del Paine.  What size back pack do you recommend? I really like the feel of the Osprey Aura which is 50L but not sure if it may be slightly small (maybe a 55 or 60L would be better).  Really trying to keep light weight. Thanks for your help and post.  Very helpful. That’ll be too small because you really want to be able to fit everything inside your pack in case there’s rain, plus there are very heavy winds and anything hanging outside of your pack just makes you easier to blow over. My 75 liter was just barely big enough. For the O you need 8 days of food and that’s what takes up the space. I just discovered your blog as my wife and I are considering a Patagonia adventure next winter…you’re a rockstar!   A few questions for you if you don’t mind…-Do you think we can fit the W track into a 10 day “greatest hits” of Patagonia itinerary? …Or is it worth it for that length of trip?-My wife isn’t too keen about camping, but we’re in Patagonia, right?!  I’m thinking the “pre-set” camping options might be our best bet with prepared dinners and showers. I’m not wanting to drop $300-$500/night for a hotel.  Is that a good option?-How did you handle laundry while trekking? Any insight would be appreciated.  Thank you! Hi Bryan,– Sure, the W can be as short as 5 days– I love camping so it seems like a waste to me to spend the money on the dinners and showers but I do understand not everyone is like me. Seems like a good compromise!– LOL, brace yourself: You wear the same thing every day and then change into your other pair of clothes every night so that you’re not drenched in sweat in your sleeping bag. Then each morning you have the fun task of putting the cold wet clothes back on. If you’re carrying all of your gear you kind of have to do that. No laundry. I’m totally serious. Hi! I am flying into Punta Arenas and flying out of there too. How would you adjust the one week timeline to fit that? Thanks! Skip Argentina and go to Magdalena Island to see the penguins! Hi Kristin! My name is Alina and I’m one of your IG followers. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed your Patagonia posts. I’m going there this November and was wondering if you could give me any recommendations? We are planning to spend around a week-week and a half hiking the W trail and maybe El Chalten or go to Fitz Roy. Are there any camping grounds other than the major ones like Italiano and camp Gray? I’ve read a lot of reviews and everybody is saying that it’s hard to book those sites. The reviews were kind of old though from like 2014-2016. I contacted the Vértice website and they recommended to get back to them in April. But that’s the only response I’ve got. I haven’t heard from Conaf or Fantasticosur. I’m also wondering if you took a boat trip to the Antarctica? Thank you so much in advance! Any information would be greatly appreciated!  Best regards and happy travels to you! I really enjoy your IG page Alina Ivanova Hi Kristin!  I just wanted to say how happy I am to find your blog about Patagonia and that I really enjoyed it.

Any information would be greatly appreciated! happy travels to you! Alina I would have loved to go to Antarctica but haven’t yet. I don’t think you can squeeze it in if you only have an extra week and a half for it, though. I do know that these days you either have to book campsites ahead or, like I did, go after the high season. I went at the end of March and it was a good call. I think Italiano is a free campsite, no? Oh I’m not sure about italiano. They haven’t posted the rates on either of the three websites. They r waiting for the end of this season and told me to get back to them at the end of April. I might be able to get three weeks off and try to stretch it into 4 in November so I can take a boat to Antarctica! I’m soooo excited about this trip. I can’t wait!!! Thanks a lot for your reply. Stay safe. Great pictures from Asia by the way ??? Let me know how it goes for you! Oh I’m not sure about italiano. They haven’t posted the rates on either of the three websites. They r waiting for the end of this season and told me to get back to them at the end of April. I might be able to get three weeks off and try to stretch it into 4 in November so I can take a boat to Antarctica! I’m soooo excited about this trip. I can’t wait!!!  Thanks a lot for your reply. Stay safe. Great pictures from Asia by the way ??? My husband and I are planning a trip to Patagonia come this fall 2018. We are planning to do the W in Torres Del Paine. We are having a hard time finding out when we need to book our backpacking campsites or who to book with… Are you able to give us some information on this? Yes you can find the companies on this post. Book as early as possible! I think that might be in May. https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-circuit/ Fantastic content!!  You have a picture of you in an ice cave, looks to be glacier trekking on this article.  Can you tell me what the name of that glacier or trek is, please?  Thank you so much and keep dominating! Yassss that’s on the Carretera Austral in Chile 🙂 https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/exploradores-glacier-trekking/ As others have said, Kristin, your blog is super informative! Thank you for sharing your experience with us.  I am going to Buenos Aires last minute, and booked an extra 10 days to hopefully go see Patagonia. I’m a veteran solo traveler, fluent Spanish. I would go by your one-week itinerary.  But we’re talking about July 26- Aug 3. It’s winter!  I know you didn’t travel Patagonia in that season, but do you think that most things can be arranged once I get there?   I figure it’s low season so (1) stuff shouldn’t be full, but (2) stuff might not run at all.  Booking in advance is so hard from 7K miles away…and in a rush.   —> Do you think if I book a round trip flight to El Calafate, and hostel for the first night, I can sort things out once on the ground, even though my time is a bit limited? Also, I’m a good hiker but not a mountaineer. —> From what you saw, do you think with winter conditions, I would just need a local guide anyhow?  For example, I’m familiar with New Hampshire: totally fine in the summer, but in the winter people do actually die from avalanches and unstable snow even though you wouldn’t think 400-foot mountains would do that. With much appreciation for your work,Tami Hey Tami, even in high season I booked nothing ahead of time except for guesthouses, sometimes. Even then I often just showed up because so many aren’t online, or weren’t 3 years ago. I think you’ll be alright!  The other thing is the season. In winter most trails will be impassable or very difficult/dangerous. I’m guessing you can still go see Perito Moreno – no problem, but the hiking trails might not be as available. Could you also go to Bariloche? Driving around the lakes is awesome and gorgeous and I’m guessing that’s still possible. More on that here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-bariloche/ I would like know the cost of a trip to Patagonia including Buenos Aires. Thank you Totally depends on where you stay and how long you go for. More here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-trip-cost/ Hi…I am doing research on a trip 4 women are doing into the Northern Chilean Patagonia area the last week of January.We are visiting a friend on the island of Chiloe and thought a side trip a doable. The plan is to fly into Balmaceda, pick up a rental vehicle and head off to see as much as we can. Thus far Glacier San Raphael, the marble caves (I have heard that you can kayak to them) and a hike or two in the Parque Patagonia. We have six and a half days. We do not plan to camp but hope to find relatively inexpensive accomodation and food on our travels. Two of our number will be flying out of Balmaceda to Santiago at the end of these days.  Do you have advice or suggestions re:this plan? Any other recommended sites. Etc. At this point other than the dates we are flexible. Thank you A lot of what you mentioned are places I didn’t visit, however I can confirm that you can find decently priced hospidajes if you don’t want to camp — it’s what I did. Hi Kristin, Firstly, your blog is freaking amazing!! I have loved reading all about yours trips so thank you for everything you’ve shared.  My husband and I are heading of on a ten month trip next year to South America and Europe. We love meeting new people and experiencing the local culture. We’re 28 and 29 and don’t mind roughing it a bit. We plan on flying in Buenos Aires, doing five nights there, then busing to Mendoza for four nights then bariloche for three nights with the possibility of more. We have a few set dates we need to be in places but are pretty flexible.  I have checked out your itineraries and am wondering how long we should stay in Bariloche for? At the moment we’ve got the three nights and thought we might do some overnight hikes…  Then I thought we would bus to El Calafate and El Chalten. How long would you recommend in El Calafate and El Chalten? We enjoy hiking and I love the look of all the holes you’ve posted so we’d hope to do some of them.  I’m also not sure whether we should cross the border into Chile and then back into Argentina or work down Argentina and then just go up Chile? Anddddd… another question haha. Buses… did you book them when you got there or should we pre book them? I’m planning to try and book our accommodation before leaving due to peak time but can cancel for free if needed.  Anyway, so sorry for the mega long post!!!  Thanks again for such an awesome blog!  Em Hey Em,Glad you like what you’ve found! If you want to do an overnight hike in Bariloche then 3 days might not be sufficient, unless you’re not including the hike in those days. You could spend a bit less time in Buenos Aires (but that’s coming from a girl who just doesn’t like cities much). You could fly down to El Chalten and save yourself some time, but not money, obv. Since you have ten months why not give yourself some flexibility and stay places for as long as you feel like it and leave when it feels right? You might end up doing that anyways. I spent about 6 days in each El Chalten and Bariloche, crossing between Chile and Argentina frequently, however I went down the Carretera Austral. You could stick on the Argentina side then bus over to Chile from El Calafate for Torres del Paine. That’s what I’d probably do in your situation. Enjoy! Thanks so much for your quick reply 🙂  Awesome. Yeah when we are in Bariloche that time doesn’t include the hike I just thought we could book a few nights, do some day hikes and figure out some over night hikes to do while we’re there.  You’re right, we were planning on seeing how we go but I was sure with peak time how much to book or do you think we’ll still be able to find accommodation in Jan and not stress too much about booking it prior.  And yeah due to our time we’re happy to bus as it’s cbeaper, are these easy enough to book as you go? Or should we book those early due to peak time?  Thanks for the suggestion of busing over too 🙂 was the Cerretera Austal another bigger hike?  Em I tended to book the next ticket as soon as I knew I was moving on, which was a day or maybe 2 before, and that worked out well for me. It was in February – April which was not AS much of a peak time, but still high season. Hope that helps! The carretera is a long, gravel road spanning the more rural part of Chilean Patagonia. Far fewer people go there, and it’s amazing! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-hitchhiking-guide/ Thank youuu 🙂 I’m sure I’ll have more questions as we plan more. Hi thanks for this awesome post, website,… Do you have some tips how to book your campsides when you are doing a full month Patagonia experience?  Some website, prices, timings when to book,… We will bring our own camping gear/food/… Thanks! Hi Nathan, you do need to book ahead for Torres del Paine but otherwise I showed up and found all of my accommodation in person.Torres del Paine info: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-circuit/ Hi! Is it possible to get from Villa O’Higgins down to Torres del Paine/Puerto Natales without crossing into Argentina? Thanks! Nope. Hey Kristin,I am more of a silent reader normally, but since I love your tips and I’ll be going to Chile for 4 weeks mid october to mid november I am commenting.With your knowledge could you give me a thumbs up or down for this itinerary?6-7 days Santiago, Valparaiso, maybe Pucon surroundings down to Purto Montt7 days Puerto Montt – Coyhaique with a rental car (we can only afford it to this point)~8 days Coyhaique – O’Higgins – Argentina – Punta Arenas (hitchhiking/ public transport)(I thought we’ll have plenty of outdoor/ hiking options before so no need for doing the W trek for example, maybe a day tour in Torres del Peine)~6 days surfing/beach time in Pichilemu (after flying back north) Esspecially for the Coyhaique – Punta Arenas part I am not sure if it is realistic to get there without stress in this time… All the best!Chris Hmm, I would give Santiago less time, give Puerto Montt almost zero time if you can, and give more time to the Carretera wherever you can, especially if you like backpacking. Looks pretty good, though! Hi Kristin, Thanks for your help guide. Quick question – You recommend after Torres Del Paine going back to El Calafate before heading to Punta Arena the next day. Is there a reason you wouldn’t want to go directly from Puerto Natales to Punta Arena? Seems like you could save a few hours of traveling! Best,Anna If you don’t care about seeing the Perito Moreno glacier than you could skip El Calafate. Most people want to see it, though! If you don’t care about seeing the Perito Moreno glacier then you could skip El Calafate. Most people want to see it, though! Hi Kristin, On your two week Patagonia itinerary Day 12, you write heading back to Puerto Natales from the Torres del Paine before heading to Punta Arenas the next morning. There seem to be buses that can take you straight from the Torres del Paine to PUnta Arenas. Is there any reason why one would not do that (would save us a few hours of travel). We were hoping to make sure there wasn’t another reason. Thank you! -Anna Hi Anna, as far as I know the buses always go to Puerto Natales first, but maybe they offer ones to PA during the highest season? If so, go for it. However since Puerto Natales is on the way to Punta Arenas, I don’t think it adds several hours to stop there, unless you’re mixing up the two places? I do that all the time, lol. Really helpful post Kristen! Thanks for all the tips. I’m so annoyed at myself as we’ve left it too late to do the W trek this November (unless guided and we don’t have that kind of money!) so I think we’ll try do your one week itinerary in reverse and fly into punta arenas and out of el calafate.  Might be a stupid question, but for the day hikes from el Chalten, I assume they’re easy to get to by bus/without a car i.e. getting to the starting point of cerro Torre, condor and Fitz Roy? Also is Fitz Roy ok to do on our own as I met another traveller who said she almost had a deadly experience hiking it!  Also if we just turn up to the Perito Moreno Glacier, can we do a glacier walk without pre booking/being on a tour and if so is it worth it? Thanks so much! You can just walk to these trailheads from town. I guess for Fitz Roy, the trail up to the top is pretty steep and rocky. If it gets crowded, I could see it being difficult. I don’t think a guide will change that, it’s just the trail conditions.  I just showed up to Perito Moreno and self guided. It was great!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-hikes-in-patagonia/,10 Hikes in Patagonia You Seriously Need to Experience,Chile,"Patagonia is for hikers. Though the weather is crazy, the region is remote, and trails can be rough, it’s one of the most impressive places to do long-term treks thanks to all of the crazy rock formations and glaciers. Seriously, there are a lot of both. I spent 2 months in Patagonia, hopping between Argentina and Chile, and I don’t even know how many glaciers and waterfalls I must have seen during that time. I stopped counting. That’s how incredible the scenery in Patagonia is. After doing countless hikes, these are my top ten favorites for those exploring Patagonia, in order from north to south: Difficulty: Medium Length: 36km, overnight At the north end of Patagonia in Argentina, the Tronador hanging glacier trek is an excellent introduction to the region. If you’re starting up there like I did, don’t miss this hike. The trail starts after a 2-ish hour bus ride from the nearby town of Bariloche, popular for skiing in the winter. The beginning runs through a forest and is pretty easy until getting to a steep and winding portion called the caracoles. After that, the climb is mostly on rock and though long, the trek is not extremely difficult. There’s a refugio at the top where you can sleep for the night (book ahead in Bariloche at Club Andino!), or tote your own tent and camp. Watching the stars over the glacier is truly a spectacular sight. Read more about Bariloche and the hike here. Difficulty: Medium Length: One day The time it takes to do this hike and the difficulty can really vary, since there are several ways to get to the Refugio Frey. You can take the ski lift up to the Condor lookout then boulder for a few hours, straight up then straight down, in order to reach the refugio, or you can take the forest path, or some combo of the two. I love bouldering so I bouldered in and walked through the forest path back out, creating a loop. This hike is doable in one day but beware the steep and narrow path to the boulders for those who don’t like heights. It even had me shaking a bit and I don’t mind them at all! Difficulty: Medium Length: One day This used to be a multi-day trek from just outside of Coyhaique along the Carretera Austral, but these days they’ve opened up the ’emergency route’ from the town of Villa Cerro Castillo that sits just at the base, and allow hikers to go up the steep trail that takes only one day. The Cerro Castillo, with its aqua-blue glacial lake and black rocks covered in white glacial ice would be a treat in and of itself, but the views in every direction of the painted mountains and canyons that lead to and away from Villa Cerro Castillo are absolutely stunning as well. If you find yourself here, meet a gaucho and go on the hike. It’s an excellent way to spend a day. Difficulty: Medium Length: Depends – full day of trekking for at least 8 hours Part of what makes Patagonia exciting is how recently certain parts of it have been made accessible. It wasn’t even until the late ’80s that one could drive all the way down the Carretera Austral, the mostly gravel road that runs through Chilean Patagonia. Towards the end of it, you’ll find Puerto Rio Tranquilo, the gateway to the Exploradores Glacier. A local there who runs the tours told me that he only became aware of the glacier over the past five years, and that tours on it have only been going for the last couple. They last several hours and it requires climbing over rocks on the glacier moraine for quite some time before reaching the ice, but once you do, you’ll see ice caves galore. More on how to do it yourself here. Difficulty: Easy Length: Depends – 2 or 3 full days  This isn’t a typical hike, per se, so much as walking between two countries in no-man’s land. That makes this one of the most unique hikes in Patagonia and one you won’t see many others on. This hike sits at the very end of the Carretera Austral, and requires a boat ride, which stops by the gorgeous O’Higgins Glacier, then goes onward to the most remote farm in Chile. Overnight there then get ready to hoof it for 22km into Argentina through no-man’s land. Once you cross into Argentina, you have the choice to take a boat or to walk an additional 15km to where busses (or cars, if you fancy hitchhiking), can take you into the town of El Chaltén. Keep in mind you’ll be carrying all of your stuff with you for this one, so while it’s mostly flat, you’ll be loaded up and trudging through mud. If you want to give it a try, you can read all about the crossing here. Difficulty: Strenuous Length: 63km, 4 days  I won’t sugarcoat it, this is one of the toughest treks that I did in Patagonia. Parts of it are straight up and parts of it are straight down. For much of it, there is no real trail and it’s necessary to navigate by GPS. You’ll also need to bring a harness along to pull yourself across two rivers. This one ain’t for pansies! All that said, this is one of only five trails in Patagonia that you can see the Southern Patagonian Ice Field from, and this view is worth it. Also, this is one of the least-crowded trails in all of Patagonia and while you won’t find any services or well-maintained campgrounds along the way, this is the real Patagonia and it’s incredible. Read more about the glacier lagoon and the Huemul Circuit here. Difficulty: Mostly easy, then strenuous Length: Full day Do you recognize those rocks? This famous formation is on the label for Patagonia clothing, and is probably one of the most recognizable sights in Patagonia. Though this is a very famous trek, it’s definitely worth climbing to the top, despite the crowds, to see the Fitz Roy. You can start the trek from the town of El Chaltén. Most of it is flat and lovely, until the final hour of the trek which is straight up a rocky trail. It will be strenuous, but it will also be worth it! Read more on the Fitz Roy (and the Torres noted below) here.   Difficulty: Easy Length: Depends – full day of trekking for at least 8 hours Finally, an easy trek that you can take from the town of El Chaltén without having to plan an overnight or sore muscles the next day! I say above that the length depends because it’s possible to combine the Fitz Roy and the Torres to make it an overnight hike, or if you’re fit enough and leave early enough in the day, it’s possible to hit them both and return back to town for dinner. Though the trek is mostly flat, it’s long, so make sure that you bring along lunch and plenty of snacks! Difficulty: Strenuous Length: One day This is yet another trail in Patagonia that will have almost nobody else on it, but this time it’s not just due to the difficulty (by the way, this is a very steep trail on rock that just goes straight up and can experience some seriously heavy wind), but also due to the fact that it’s private land. It belongs to the Hotel Las Torres but if you stay with them, you can take horses part way up and down (recommended to save your knees), and you get a view of the towers that almost nobody else sees. Difficulty: Medium Length: 120km over 8 days (avg.) The crown jewel of long hikes in Patagonia, Torres del Paine is great to work up to if you’re going from north to south like I did. Each year this park gets exponentially more popular as trekkers discover that Torres del Paine in Chile is a worthy adventure, full of changing landscapes and a glimpse of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, especially from the full O circuit. The trek takes about 8 days, give or take, and goes in a loop. If you’re short on time, it’s also possible to hike what’s known as the W, which shaves three days off of the trek and still shows you some amazing views, but none of the ice field, which was a special treat. Read more here on how to prepare for Torres del Paine and for 2019, I’m offering a women’s tour there! Click here to read more. If you’d rather not do 8 days, here are a few day hikes in Torres del Paine worth checking out. So are you convinced yet to head to Patagonia? Though it’s not the easiest place in the world to hike, it’s definitely one of the most picturesque and impressive. If it’s your first time hiking through, be sure to check out my guide to trekking in Patagonia, read up on what to pack, and check out my itineraries for one week, two weeks, and one full month in Patagonia. Happy hiking! Hi there,Great informative post and amazing pictures! Will for sure plan some trekking/hiking when visiting Patagonia. So many amazing Patagonia posts! I would seriously not mind if Patagonia is all you wrote about for the rest of time 😀 I may just have to follow your exact itinerary through this bit of the world one day because I want to do every single thing you wrote about. I’m out of things to say about it now 🙁 I’ll need to go back I guess 🙂 I really liked the Tronador but that’s two days. I also enjoyed the Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre quite a bit. Hi, Is a great blog, indeed, I hike all those places and there is a great destination called Cochamo, In Chile. Which I go frecuentarlo with clients who want to go across the andes to Argentina. Is a must! This looks absolutely stunning! I spent awhile looking at photos of Patagonia and it’s definitely a Bucket List destination for us. I just hope that there are enough trails and places to visit for those of us who can’t really make it through a rough 20 miles route? I think I can comfortably manage 5 miles but not sure about much longer… I really do want to see these amazing places though! Most of the hikes I did are long and can be difficult but there may be more options 🙂 Hi and thank you!I will be doing a Spanish language immersion program in Buenos Aires for two weeks.  Following that I would like to go with an organized group to hike Machu Picchu and to “hike in Patagonia” (I know it’s a large area!).  Would you recommend I hike in Patagonia first, and then head up to Machu Picchu (instead of doing Buenos Aires then M.P. then Patagonia?).  And what would be the one amazing Patagonia hike to do that is as close as possible to Buenos Aires?  Thank you again…!! You could head to Bariloche: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-bariloche/ Hi, I really like your blog! When you did the Huemul Circiut, did you do it on your own or with a guide? I’m traveling on my own and I don’t want to do it by myself, do you know if there are companies in Patagonia I can to the circiut with?Thanks <3 You can definitely do it with guided groups. I did not have a guide, and actually met a guy on the trail who started the trek on his own then asked if he could join up so that he wouldn’t be solo and of course Steve and I said yes. That was a gamble he took starting on his own, though. Hey, Great content and amazing hikes ! I am currently roughly following your route trough Patagonia, but I am not getting as lucky as you with the weather 🙁 On all of the pictures you have awesome weather and gret views. I just get rain and clouds haha. Unfortunaly I couldn’t see neither Cerro Castillo nor the Fitz Roy. How did you manage to always have perfect weather ? Was it just pure luck, did you sometimes wait  for good forecasts or even went multiple times for the same hike ?  Cheers ! Hey Max, since I spent 2 months there I waited it out when the weather was bad. I had 10 days in El Chalten and hiked for 6 of them. I did also just get very lucky! Hi MAx. The best time to visit Patagonia in my view is March,. I live in Patagonia, born In Argentina and I can recommend early December or March,  still very good weather and less tourists, Although the climate  is  changeable and unpredictable. Hello there, I loved reading this article!Was wondering – for those treks that you’ve mentioned did you do them as day trip, camping? Solo or with hired group? I’m  a solo female traveller doing my first big trip to South America July-December and I’m hoping to cut costs by hiking and trekking solo, maybe camp as well 🙂 of course, this is my first trip so safety and not getting lost in wilderness is of top concern Thank you! Hi Anthea,I never did a group or hired a guide for any of these Except for the Exploradores Glacier because you really need one when glacier trekking as they know where the crevasses are. I noted on each one how long it took. Some were day trips and some were more like 4 or even 8 days. I was with my friend Steve so I wasn’t solo but on every trail except for the Huemul Circuit, there were plenty of other people so you won’t be hiking alone! Awesome coverage of the hikes. I have been in Patagonia for 1 month and am still here. Sadly, I hurt my knee on the third day of the W trek, returned on the 4th day, missed out the Torres. When I attempted Fitz Roy a week later, just 5 minutes from the top, there was a snowstorm, it was extremely windy and slippery and everyone had to turn back. Patagonia hasn’t been kind to me 🙁 Bad knee = missing out on pretty much the whole Patagonia haha. Ah, I can imagine Patagonia gets more and more difficult as it gets snowy and icy! Definitely do some stuff on boats then! Visit glaciers without having to hike 🙂 Hello Kristin, Love your blog! Using it alot to plan our trip!You mentioned that the Huemul Circuit is one of the five treks with views of the Southern Patagonia Ice Field. We’re really keen on getting views of the ice field but the Huemul Circuit looks really challenging! Could you share what the other treks are? Thx! You can see it from the O in Torres del Paine as well! Less challenging: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-circuit/ Hi Kristin, Thank you for sharing all the beautiful inspirational pictures and details about your favorite hikes.   Can you tell me more about how I can do The Torres & Fitz Roy in one day?  I was planning on doing the W-circuit and taking a bus to El Chalten to do a Fitz Roy day hike.    Thank you.Olivia Sure, there’s a part in the trail where the two connect but that doesn’t meant the Torres in Chile it means the Torres out of El Chalten. They have the same name. Awesome post!! Going to Patagonia in one month and this is awesome!!! I spent february and march in Patagonia. Your posts were very helpful, especially about the hikes around Bariloche and Torres del Paine and along the Carreterra Austral! I didn’t make it all the way to Higgins but it was quite an adventure! Chile stole my heart. As a solo female traveller it gave me a lot of confidence to do it on my own. So thanks again for that! Looking forward to new posts! Amazing! Thanks so much for coming back to tell me! I’m glad that you went and had a blast. Patagonia is so amazing. awesome post! Argentina is home to some beautiful spots, but it can get crowded and expensive (especially torres del paine)  I just finished an article about free trekking near bariloche incase any other travelers in Argentina are looking for some outdoor adventure. check it out 🙂 Wouldn’t you know TdP is in Chile, then? Ohhhhh we did laugh tremendously didn’t we Joffers HiAll sound so wonderful!My husband and I will be in Beunos Aires and would love to make it to Patagonia just for a few days and do a hike or two. We are moderate hikers from Northern California, and would be interested in some 8 Mile hikes. Any suggestions? And where would we fly into for the hikes.Thanks!Anna Maybe look at Bariloche then! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-bariloche/I love El Chalten too but you’re looking at much longer than 8 miles for almost all of the hikes. Thanks for the information!  Based on what i read, I will take in the ice caves.  I will take your word when you say this is much better than Grey.  I look forward to leaving for Chile in 3 days.  I just miss my Minnesota winters so much, I need to find one. If you mean Exploradores YEAH that glacier was soo cool! I’ve hiked on a few since and none had those awesome ice caves. Have a blast. Hey! Your Patigonia blog is being a lifeline for me planning my trip for 2 months to the area. I was wondering if you could give me any ideas though. I have these 2 months off work and really want to feel like I’ve achieved something out there with the time. All the hikes like the o and the Huemul look amazing and am so keen to do but what I want to combine is a real journey rather than lots of things I could really do on holiday.  Walk from a town to another for 2 weeks or something if you get my drift…. Any help appreciated!! Xxxxx Then I bet you’d love the Carretera Austral: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-hitchhiking-guide/ Thanks for the advices trek, it definitely worth reading. Can you recommend an equipment ? Do you think it’s possible with a tarp ?!Thank you ! Gosh that would be so cold! I have suggestions here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-prepare-for-trekking-in-patagonia/ Hi guys,Does anyone have some tips for the best 4-5 day trek, up to 5-6,000 metres? Ive done a fair few hikes/light climbs around that before. Or maybe a combo of two treks, doesnt really need to be high.Thanks very muchSam thankfully Patagonia is low elevation! You could turn a lot of the hikes in El Chalten into at least an overnight or 3-day trek: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-chalten-hiking-guide/ The W in Chile is just the shorter version of the O and can be 5 days: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-circuit/ Thanks Kristin – it looks truly wonderful.  I am trying to plan some treks like this in Patagonia myself.  Lots of tour companies organise (expensive) organised treks that can be booked months in advance.  My preference, however, would be just to go to the area and do the treks on the spur of the moment that are appropriate to the current weather conditions etc..  Is it common to meet up with other like-minded people in the main hubs (e.g. Bariloche) and just decide to trek together?  E.G. Are there local hiking clubs running lots of treks daily/weekly etc? I’m just trying to avoid the hit-and-miss business of organising treks from afar.  regards. Rob You should be able to meet others to hike with. Stay in hostels instead of hotels and it’ll be easier. Hey Kristin! Thanks for the amazing article. I am planning a trip to Patagonia in February and am very excited for all the different trekking options. I did have one question though – the Las Pumas hike that you mentioned…I can’t seem to find much information about it. I was wondering if you could let me know where the starting point of the hike begins. If I plan on doing the O circuit, does it make sense to add one additional day at the beginning or end of the trek at the Central or Chileno campgrounds in order to fit the hike in? Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you, Charles To do Las Pumas you have to be a guest at the Hotel Las Torres, which is probably why you didn’t see much about it. The trail is on their private property. Got it!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-circuit/,2020 Guide to the O Circuit in Torres Del Paine,Chile,"Torres del Paine in Chile is the cherry on top of the Patagonia experience for most hikers. It’s hard to top the ice field, horn and tower-like rock formations, and the ever changing landscape from day to day of the trek. I’ve hiked the O Circuit in Torres del Paine twice now, and it’s one of my favorites in the world for the physical challenges, the harsh but stunning landscape, and the number of ‘wow!’ moments. Trekking in Torres del Paine is different than anywhere else in the world. You can pretty much count on very strong winds, rain, mud, and sometimes even snow. It sounds extreme but with the proper gear and preparation it’s a lot easier to enjoy it. These are a few things to know before taking on the O Circuit trek:  The bus that brings you to the park will stop at the headquarters where you pick up your permits and sign in. Next there will be several other buses that make several stops, including the Welcome Center and the Hotel Las Torres, where I started. You can also get off on the last stop and do the Q trek, or take a boat to the Grey Glacier and start from there. There’s no right or wrong place to start. Personally, I knew that I wanted to do the entire O trek and preferred to finish with the Torres, so I started at the Welcome Center. If you’re unsure whether or not you want to do the whole thing and want to test the W (the shorter trek) first, you can get the boat over and hike to Refugio Grey. But if you’re toying with doing the full O Circuit, you really should! Also keep in mind that if you’re hiking the O you can only go in a counterclockwise direction, whereas those on the W can go both ways. If you’re doing the O, or just considering it, make sure you’re going counterclockwise. By tacking on another three days in Torres del Paine you gain several things: Some of the most beautiful parts of the trail are on the part of the trail that the W doesn’t cover. Some say it’s even the best part of the whole trek. Yes, you have to get over the John Gardner Pass, but the reward of hiking next to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field all day is so worth it. You’ll get views that most people who visit the park don’t see.  The trail is much less crowded on the back end of the park, and the refugios have a more intimate feel. The camaraderie with the other hikers is easier to come by because there are fewer people on the trail. You tend to meet each other, talk, hang out, and get to know each other before joining the masses on the W. Convinced yet? Don’t worry, you can do it! Torres del Paine has increased in popularity by 30% year over year. If hiking during high season, you would be wise to book camping spots ahead of time, which you can do in town or on Fantastico Sur and Vertice Patagonia. This wasn’t necessary when I went at the end of March but in January and February, definitely look into it.  When booking your campsites you’ll have the option to just reserve a spot where you’d pitch your own tent, a place in a refugio, which are limited, or tents that are already pitched for you. The last option is typically a package deal that also includes all of your meals. Which should you go for? If you have the budget, the tent rentals provide the best flexibility. This is what I liked about them: The biggest downside is the cost. If you bring your own gear, you’ll be paying about a quarter of the price. You can always opt to eat some of your meals in refugios to decrease your weight, but also keep in mind they will serve guests first, so it’s not always guaranteed that you can eat in every refugio. Backpacking in Patagonia comes with a unique set of challenges that other parts of the world aren’t as well known for. In Patagonia you can count on heavy winds, rain, and even snow. You’ll want to bring gear that can withstand the elements, particularly that super insane wind! Keep the following in mind: It’s tempting to bring a normal tent from home, I know, but a typical dome tent does not fare well in the wind in Patagonia. The last thing you want on an 8-day trek is to end up with a tent you can’t use, so get one that is good in heavy winds. I used an MSR tent and it worked great. The key is the sturdy but light tent poles, which will hold up in the wind but won’t weigh you down tremendously. Every ounce counts when you have to carry 8 days worth of provisions! Get travel insurance that covers hiking. This basic package covers hiking under 3000 meters (this trek is definitely under that). There is no search and rescue in the park, and this will cover you if you need extra help getting out should you experience an injury. Don’t believe anyone who tells you that running shoes are just fine to use in Torres del Paine. The trail is very muddy and rocky, and some ankle protection plus a waterproof shell are both important to keeping you dry and blister-free. Remember to lace them up tight and get some nice thick socks as well! This is the pair of boots that I recommend and these are the socks I suggest. *If you do get blisters, Compeed is a really helpful blister bandage. It’s sweat-proof, so each one can last a couple of days. The wind on two days of the trek in Patagonia literally lifted me up and slammed me forward, it was so strong. My hiking poles saved my face by helping me with balance. They also help tremendously for going downhill, especially if your knees tend to bother you on long hikes, or if this is the first one you’re attempting. Like with the tent poles, sturdy but light ones are great to have along. Cheap ones break quickly. These are the ones I used. A rain cover isn’t very useful in Patagonia. Due to the wind, they either blow right off or make tons of noise in your ears as the wind runs through them. Since the wind seriously does reach 100km/hour and over, they can blow right off and then become litter in the park. Nobody wants that! The solution is to line your backpack with a bin liner/trash bag and to wrap everything inside in its own bag as well. It’s okay if the backpack gets wet. It’ll dry out in the wind and they’re made to be resilient. The stuff inside will stay dry with the double bag protection. Happy days! All the powdered food! I know that’s not very exciting, but in all seriousness, cans, packaged sauces, and anything that creates a lot of waste will be heavy and annoying on the trail. Food is the heaviest item on an 8-day trek, so it’s essential to cut weight wherever possible. There’s so much water available everywhere along the trail, flowing from every glacier and stream, so buying things that just need to be rehydrated works best. It’s also helpful to pack lunches that don’t need to be cooked that you can snack on while moving or during short breaks. I’d suggest fruit and nuts. They pack lots of energy and calories for their weight. Here’s my food list for 8 days (consider that portions depend on your personal food intake, and keep in mind you’ll be exercising a lot): You can buy all of the food you’ll need in the shops in Puerto Natales. I urge you to shop at the small, independent grocers and split your shopping between a few stores. There’s even a dedicated fruit and nut shop with dried mango and melon! So what else goes into your pack? Chances are 80% of it will be full with food, and I’d also bring along: I also brought along my camera, of course, and several extra camera batteries. You can find out more about my camera equipment here. You can lighten your load by eating at some of the refugios. The food is great at Refugio Dickson, in particular. You can also buy some supplies as you go along. Don’t count on it, but know that it’s often possible to get more food and snacks if necessary. Some camps have nice, hot showers that you can use along the trek. It’s much easier to get some shower time in the less crowded camps that are not part of the W, though some of the larger refugios on the W part have more bathroom options. I’ve seen a huge difference in the size of the refugios and availability of restrooms and showers since the first time I did the trek. Everything is growing and the facilities are only getting better. My absolute favorite shower was at Frances, and the worst is still Los Perros, which is cold and not worth it! The free camps don’t have amenities like showers and sometimes don’t have toilets that flush, but they’re typically in really beautiful settings (and they’re free!). How many days should you spend on the trail? How long will it take you to complete? I’ve done it two ways, spending 8 days hiking and 9 days. In both cases, the day that I crossed the John Gardner Pass was the longest, most exhausting day. The big difference between the two was splitting up the day that followed into two the second time around. The days on the back end of the O are pretty long, and you never really know what kind of weather you may get, so a buffer can be a good idea just in case. I personally am always happy to spend more time in nature, but if you’re pressed for time, you can do it all in 8 days. I have a day-to-day itinerary here! You can also download the PDF below:  We can’t talk about backpacking in the wilderness without discussing leaving no trace. The biggest issue right now in Torres del Paine is erosion of the trails. It may not seem like a big deal, but ‘social trails’ left by people trying to avoid mud can cause irreparable damage. Unless I’m going to get totally soaked or covered in mud, I step right in the mud and keep going. My shoes are waterproof so it’s no problem, right? The water in Patagonia is some of the cleanest in the world, yet some camps have had to close down due to sanitation issues. Why does this happen? Please keep the following in mind to do your part: The Towers are the park’s most popular feature. Most day hikers who are only going to see one thing in the park hike to The Towers. Given that, it can be hard to see them without a crowd of other people, so here are some tips: I know that you might think I’m crazy for suggesting this, especially after the long hike to get to the camp at the base of the Torres, but it’s so worth climbing up to the top twice if you have time – once in the afternoon and once in the morning for sunrise. If you can’t get reservations at Chileno for the final night, you may not have much of a choice. Nobody is allowed to attempt to hike up after 3pm. This is to make sure nobody camps up there, which is fair TBH. However if you run out of time, you can always make it back up for the morning from Campamento Central or Chileno. My tip for avoiding the crowds is to go up while it’s still dark before the sun rises. However I would NOT recommend this alone and if you do decide to go, it’s best to go with someone who has already been up there. I led a group up to the top and it’s good that I already knew the way. When it’s dark all you have to go on are the reflective markers. That said, we got to the top around 5am to see the Milky Way going right through The Towers and nobody was there yet. Most people show up throughout the day starting with the sunrise. It’s hard to rate the difficulty of a trek, since such things are subjective, but I’d say the O Circuit in Torres del Paine is a moderate trek. Some days are pretty long, however, and you’ll be on your feet for most of the day, which can be exhausting. The hardest part for me is coming down from the John Gardner Pass since it’s such a long and steep downhill. Others also feel that the Torres are a tough ending as well. It takes about 30-45 minutes to climb to the base of the Torres from the Las Torres ranger station and about 2-3 hours from Chileno. It’s steep, but if you’ve already done Fitz Roy, I can assure you it’s not nearly as bad. Besides, moving keeps you warm. It was snowing when I reached the base of the Torres in late March the first time! I stayed at the Hotel Las Torres in the park right after the trek both times I’ve done it now and it was the best decision ever. The food was great (it’s all-inclusive) as were the drinks and the activities. They even grow all of their own veggies in an organic garden, which is SO WELCOME after 8 days of trail food. It’s so nice to stay somewhere comfortable for a few days after finishing an 8-day trek, and though this is definitely fancier than a tent, it’s a really welcome change. I also really liked that it included horseback riding and some treks that aren’t on the usual TDP menu (you can book a stay here). One huge benefit of staying at the Hotel Las Torres, apart from the comfort, is access to this amazing viewpoint. It’s called the Puma trek and it sits on the hotel’s property. It’s also one of the steepest and toughest treks in the entire park. We went there the day after finishing the 8-day trek and I was definitely sore after!   The day after the trek I’ve done a full Paine bus tour with the Hotel Las Torres twice now, and twice I loved it. There’s just no better way to see the parts of the experience you miss from the trail. There are so many different angles and views that you get by covering more ground with the tour, and it’s a nice chance to let your body take a break, too. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on May 25, 2016 at 9:11am PDT  There are a lot of picturesque places in the park that you don’t see when trekking on the Circuit trails. The park is absolutely full of lakes of all colors, glaciers, different viewpoints, and even waterfalls. The full Paine tour also includes a boat trip to the Grey Glacier, for yet another great perspective. Most of this is accessible by car, so in lieu of renting one yourself and driving it through the park, you can take a day tour from Puerto Natales or in my case, as part of staying at the Hotel Las Torres. Finally, if you want to do this trek but aren’t confident doing it on your own or just want to be with a group of amazing women, I’ll be running another Patagonia tour in March 2020 including a stay at the Hotel Las Torres, all of the logistics figured out for you, tents, food, and everything else provided so that you don’t have to carry it, plus photography workshops, and expert guides (like me!). You can learn more here. Happy trekking! *Some links in this post are affiliate links. Any purchase you make through these links gives me a small commission at no cost to you. This post was also brought to you in collaboration with the Hotel Las Torres. All reviews on this site are always sincere.    Wow, this looks fantastic! I’m too old to hike this but Patagonia is absolutely on my bucket list! I met two 60-somethings on the trail and they were faster than I was! You could definitely still do the Paine Grande tour, though. No hiking involved 🙂 Thanks for this really thorough guide! I’m wondering, did you rent or buy any of your trekking gear (poles, tent, etc) locally or did you bring it from “home”? Wondering if it is worth lugging camping gear around Chile for the 4 weeks I’ll be there prior to doing Patagonia. Thanks! I bought a sleeping bag, sleeping mat, and hiking poles in Chile and everything else I brought from home. I actually used the camping gear all throughout Patagonia and it would also be useful in Easter Island as well, and maybe even the Atacama desert, so it might be worth it. It’s not cheaper to buy in Chile and DEFINITELY don’t buy anything in Argentina! Hi Kristin, I’ve enjoyed your post very much. I am planning my own trekk to Torres del Paine an dto Mt Fitzroy. Your tips come in very handy. Thanks for sharing. Why are you saying “don’t buy anything in Argentina”? Cheers,Adrian I just mean don’t buy your gear in Argentina because it’s the most expensive place you can buy it. However the currency fluctuates a lot there so that advice could change at any time. When I was there prices of things were insane. Thanks for the wonderful article, Kristin. I have done the W track myself and have to absolutely 100% agree with ALL your recommendations! I wish I could go back for the big O, after seeing your photos 🙂 I’m now in Chiang Mai by the way, living the good digital nomad life 🙂 Anyway, thank you for all your inspiring and informative articles and photos, I can’t say how much I enjoy following your journey. Thanks for the wonderful comment, Barbora! The W is a great trek itself, and I’d definitely recommend that to anyone visiting TDP with limited time. Enjoy Chiang Mai! Oh how I miss Thai food! Hi, Thanks for the great article. This is definitely on my bucket list for next year. I was wondering though, how hard is it for a solo female to trek in Patagonia? I wish I had a friend that would come with me, but schedules never seem to work out. I’ve trekked in New Zealand solo and with friends in Nepal. Also, how much Spanish is really necessary to get around in Chile? I’m a beginner and was going to start studying it again. Good tip about the gear. I’m planning on bringing all of it with me from the US. Hey Michelle, it just depends on where in Patagonia you are because some trails are more remote and have way fewer trekkers. That said, I met a few solo trekkers (both joined me at one point) and I really feel that when you put yourself out there, you’ll find people. This was the first trip in over 3 years that I took with someone else (Steve) and before that I went to Nepal solo and met someone on the bus on my way to start the trek and we became great friends. This ain’t your first rodeo, you’ll be able to meet others.  You will struggle without knowing some Spanish. I’m a beginner too and I was able to get around, but definitely keep practicing because it’ll only help you. The toughest thing for me is I can understand almost everything but I can’t respond! This looks incredible! I’ll get to do it one day hopefully and definitely using your guide (and all the others)!  xx I think so too. There seems to be an endless amount of trails! Hi Kristin! Your adventures look amazing!I’m Rose from Sydney!I’m planning to do the W track in Feb next year, and wanted to ask you a few questionsI was wondering about the Puma Track that you mentioned that you did during your stay at hotel la torres. Which horse trails it it part of? I see the hotel offers several horse riding trails. Also how long would this track take to do, as I’m wondering if I can make it for the afternoon shuttle back to Natales.Do you know if the puma track is accessble to visitors that don’t stay at the hotel?thanks so much for answering my queries! Rose I’m pretty sure you have to stay at the hotel, and it’s an all day thing. Would be hard to do the puma trail and get on a bus after. You can show them the photo on this page and they will know exactly which trek you want to do 🙂 Hi Kristin!  Where did you get your white visor headband?! China! Hi Kristin, Thanks so much for your great post and for sharing your beautiful photos! I’m looking at going to Patagonia next year and I have about 2 weeks. I am trying to decide whether to do the full Torres Del Paine O or whether to do the W and couple it with a some hikes around El Chatelan as well as a visit to Perito Moreno. Am I trying to do too much? Hi Hala, You could probably make it work if you are OK with not having rest days, which can be tough. I wrote out some itinerary options here which should help: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-itinerary/ Thank you for your response and for the inspiration 🙂 I will be doing the full circuit in January next year and can’t wait! Hey, great read! I had a quick question I was hoping you could help me with. I’m headed to travel South America for a year. I want to start in Chile and the O track. Is there any place to store unnecessary gear while on the hike ? I only want to bring my essentials. But I will have other things with me for the rest of the trip that will not be needed for the O track. Any suggestions ? Thanks !!! Ask the hostel you stay at before and after for a storage room. I’ve done that in every single place I’ve ever trekked and they’ve always had a space for that. They’re used to being asked. Hi Kristin! Thank you for your kind post.  I heard that since 2016 the CONAF limits the number of people on the circuit to 80 per day, so I have to make reservation ahead of time at the CONAF office in Puerto Natales.  Did you also get the reservation? And, if you did, do you know any way to reserve it in advance in online? I’m afraid the reservation will be fulled quickly at January. I’ve heard about that, and they stopped requiring them at the time of year that I went. You might already have issues, unfortunately. I’d check in with Erratic Rock in Puerto Natales and ask if they can help you out. Hey Kristin!This article is so incredibly helpful! Thanks for sharing all your tips. I’m planning on doing the O Circuit with a friend in December and I’ve never done an overnight hike before and have been relying on great tips like this one to help.One question: where do you leave all the rest of your stuff you won’t use when doing the hike? I plan on taking just a few pairs of clothes with me to hike but have 3 more months of travel afterwards through South America. I don’t want it all weighing down my pack! Any suggestions? Glad you have found the advice to be helpful! You can leave your stuff at the hostel or hotel that you stay at before your trip. I’d also suggest staying with them after as well, just as a thank you for keeping your stuff. They’re used to doing this and should have a storage room for you. You can verify with whoever you choose to stay with ahead of time if you like. I use a wire mesh bag protector to lock it all up for peace of mind as well since I tend to have a computer and other valuables in there: http://amzn.to/2eXdFDi Hi Kristin,We’re doing the Circuit in a month, and I saw your note about wire bag lock. Is theft an issue at the refugiosif you leave your bag in the tent, e.g. during dinner, shower etc ?  Do I need to always take the essentials with me passport, camera & phone?  Thank you! I don’t take my bag lock trekking, though I did lock my valuables that I didn’t take hiking up at the hotel while I was gone trekking for those 8 days. Hi Kristin! This write up is awesome. I am looking at doing the 8 day trek at the end of March, and I was wondering about renting gear. You mentioned that there are gear shops that rent gear. Do you know which are the good shops? I was planning on renting a tent and a sleeping bag because I plan to visit more countries in South America, and don’t want to carry around the excess weight. And I’m not sure about purchasing the MSR tent now; it’s fairly pricey, even in the US. Thanks again. Erratic rock rents out equipment and since it’ll be the end of March, which is when I went as well, it won’t be as busy in the park and they should have stuff to rent. I used a 70L and yes the wind will be a big problem for things strapped to the outside. It got up to 100km per hour! This is normal there, so go bigger if you can.If you’re just doing the W and don’t need as much food you might be able to fit everything into yours. I didn’t completely fill my pack and it was 8 days worth of food and such inside. Hi, you now have to book all of your camping before you start either the W or the circuit! We only came across this in a blog a couple of months ago and really struggled. Luckily we are on a long trip and could push our itinerary back by 10 days to work around availability. Crucial info for anyone thinking about Torres del Paine! Hi Nicole, during high season that’s definitely true. That’s noted near the top of the post, and you have to get permits for the park as well (also only during high season). It’s new thing as the park has become more and more popular. Glad you were able to push back the timing and I hope you have a great time! awesome info! im doing the o circuit this march and everything you wrote here is a great help. I screen captured almost everything  so I don’t forget anything 🙂 thank you very much for your time Awesome! I’m so glad that you found it helpful. Let me know how it goes for you! I also went in march and it was great 🙂 (ok it rained but that’s normal in Patagonia!) Hi Kristin, Thanks for the article!  I am hoping to hike the O circuit over 6 nights 7 days end of March but I am traveling solo and feel nervous about doing the hike alone. Did you meet a lot of people hiking end of March? How was the weather at this time of year? Is 6 nights 7 days okay if I am physically fit but haven’t done much overnight hiking trips?I’m suddenly getting nervous and am finding planning quite difficult.  Thanks, Asha You won’t be alone. Plan for rain and dress warmly, which would be true any time of year but especially then as it will be getting colder, but the leaves will also start changing and that’s beautiful! I think you should give it 8 days at least. That’s how long it took me and I’m pretty experienced, and I pushed it. Hi Kristin! Thank you so much for all of this wonderful info!  My husband and I are planning to hike the full circuit next December!  We have one question: where is your last picture taken (the one overlooking a lake and bridge)?  It’s an absolutely beautiful view, and we’d love to see it in addition to the trek! Thanks! That was from the full paine tour with the Hotel Las Torres. It’s something you’d either need a tour or a car to see and it’s of the other hotel in the park 🙂 Hi Kristen – I am considering visiting Torres Del Paine alone (40th birthday!) in the second week of September this year. I wouldn’t call myself an experienced hiker necessarily and definitely don’t have camping experience. Looking at your photos, I really want to do the O, but as someone who suffers from back, neck and shoulder issues, I am concerned about carrying too much weight especially given the wind and cold. I think I’ll be fine as a single woman, but is there ANY way I can do the O without needing to carry a tent, sleeping bag and a pad? In other words, are there places where you can rent these things along the way and get someone to help pitch the tent on the spot? I guess once I get to the W part, it will be refugios all the way so I don’t’ have to worry about food and such. Any input would be really appreciated!Thanks,Rachelle Yes, when you are in town before you go, stop by erratic rock and ask them to help you get reservations at the Refugios. That’s what I would do. Have fun! Great info! I checked your site and others long time ago to had an idea about torres del pain.  I went to do the trekking about a month and a half ago, but we needed a guide to do the W (now is mandatory for winter season) so we went to a place called Rental Natales and the owner help us to find more people and share the cost of the guide! It was incredible!  They have really good equipment also, we rented everything from there and had an amazing camping experience, we were glad that we didn’t rented from Erratic Rock like another couple, they had such as smelly and dirty equipment and they were cold most of the nights.  After the trek we rented a car and visited laguna azul, very beautiful! (thanks for that tip) thanks Anne and Lukas Thanks for the info! Cool to know it’s awesome in the winter too. I’m looking into doing this hike. A lot of preparation but i like that. Thanks for the information! Your page helps me a lot! THANK YOU for that, but there is still some questions and I´d be super happy if you help me with that also 😉  I got info about limited number of visitors at Torres del Paine NP, is that true? If yes, where can I buy ticket before I come to Chile..? Do I have to sleep in campground in the Torres del Paine NP or can I find my own place for tent? If I have to be on campground, can I reserve all the spots online?  Can I buy all the bus tickets on bus stations one day before?  I saw info about food – it´s strictly prohibited to bring my own food to the Chile, is that right? What about jerky, nuts, granola etc.? If I can´t have anything from US, can I buy everything in Puerto Natales or Punta Arenas or is even better buy everything in Santiago (I expect limited kilos in domentic flights) ..? Thx and have a perfect day,  Tereza You need a permit for TdP if you’re going during high season. I was there in March and didn’t need one anymore. As far as I know you apply for that in person. I did link info on booking camping in the post. You cannot sleep outside of the campgrounds.  I bought my bus tickets a day or two before, but during high season you might want to book a few days ahead. For some companies you can do this online.  You definitely can’t bring nuts and meat into Chile. I bought all of mine there and it wasn’t that expensive, plus you can support the local grocers which is a nice thing to do. Hi there!  I have developed a bunch of questions as I’ve started planning my trip to Torres del Paine.  I have booked my flight for December 21-January 6 and plan to complete the Circuit during that time.  I’ve done solo hikes and plenty of solo traveling, but I have never done this lengthy of a hike alone.  I am already using your tips to plan but have a couple questions.  You somewhat touched on this in your blog, but do you think there are any issues with being a single female completing the trek?  I speak Spanish well enough.  Also, you mentioned using an MSR tent.  I have a Big Agnes 2 person.  I plan to upgrade my poles before taking the trip.  Do you have any other tips for essential gear?  Some guides suggest reserving an extra night at the sites to plan for perhaps not being able to complete the John Gardner Pass on the planned day due to weather.  Did you have any issues like that?  I also want to stay in the Hotel Torres on the last night but am hesitant to make a reservation due to the idea of perhaps falling behind a day due to weather.  Thoughts? I have 2 unplanned days at the end of my hike.  I really want to try to push it and head over to Argentina.  Is this totally unrealistic to think I could go over there and scoot back to Punta Arenas to catch a flight? One last thing.  Would you be willing to share the itinerary you followed?  I thing I have it nailed down but would love to hear the route you used for comparison.   I really appreciate any help or tips folks can provide. 🙂  All the best!! There will be a lot of people on the trek and I would personally do it alone without worrying 🙂Here’s my Patagonia packing list https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/womens-patagonia-packing-list/ The earlier in the morning you leave Perros to attempt the pass the better the weather is likely to be but it is possible that it could be impassable. No way to know, unfortunately. I would ask the hotel how flexible they can be in case that happens. Here’s what I did:  Day 1. Hotel to SeronDay 2. Seron to DicksonDay 3. Dickson to Los PerrosDay 4. Los Perros to Refugio Grey – this was a long dayDay 5. Refugio Grey to ItalianoDay 6. Italiano to Los CuernosDay 7. Los Cuernos to Camp TorresDay 8. Torres then down to the hotel You could get private transport from the hotel, if you do their full package, and get a transfer right to El Calafate in Argentina in about a half a day. Otherwise don’t bother with only 2 days because you’ll have to take some public buses and it will probably not be doable in that short amount of time. I assume you want to do this in order to see Perito Moreno. It’s worth it.  Thank you so much for all of the information!  I am so excited and lucky to benefit from all of the information shared online!  One last random question… what kind of camera/lens did you use for your photos? this one: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-camera-2017/ Read your blog a lot before I went and was awestruck with your photos. Now looking back at this (sending to a friend who’s going), all my photos look the same!! The beauty is really that capture-able!! Dear Kristin,  First of all, congrats for your inspirational travel blog and for the beautiful places you’ve visited so far! I’m writing you with regards to my upcoming trip which will be in Argentina/ Chile (especially in Patagonia) where I will be traveling with my husband. We have a problem in finding accommodation for a few nights in Torres del Paine in the beginning of January 2018. We’ve started our search since October but everything is fully booked apparently.  I can’t imagine though that we won’t be able to visit the park (W circuit) due to the lack of accommodation (there is a rather recent rule for visiting the park stating that you have to present when entering the park a proof of the accommodation you’ve booked). I really suspect that this is a method for driving the tourists to book private guided tours that offer a full package (including accommodation) at an exorbitant price (e.g. $800/person). Could you please help me with any advice you have for finding accommodation or a tour at a decent price? Thank you so much,Iulia Hi Lulia, what about the campsites? I believe you do still need to reserve them ahead of time but maybe it’s still possible.  Unfortunately, the park is exploding in popularity and my guess is that they truly are booked, and that these tour companies just booked out these spots way ahead of time knowing that would happen. Thanks for sharing this great post. I really loved your photos. I am traveling to Patagonia, Chile in  Jan 2018 with my family and planning to hike the W Circuit of Torres del Paine National Park. I got much helpful information about Torres Del Paine in this post. I have already booked my trip with a travel company ChileTour Patagonia. This is my 1st time adventures trip in Chile and we want to enjoy a lot in that Torres del Paine National Park. I am very excited to visit beautiful places in Chile. Hi Kristin,this is Francesco nice to meet you I come from Naples but I live in UK.Congratulation for your blog and travel.I am planning  a trip top Torres del Paine in March.My plan is: Seron 03/4Dikson 03/05Los Perros 03/06Paso Campo 03/07Paine Grande 03/08Campo Italiano 03/09Torres Ranger Station 03/10Torres Ranger Station to the Hotel Puerto Natal/Punta Arenas on the 03/11I am doing the full circuit   could be between 7 to 9/10 days. Might add extra days/Refugio, I will see. Well I wouldn’t say I am on budget….but for what I am reading online….there is a chance to do this tour almost for free, like just touch all the free Refugio…..but you need to walk for long days….I might try this.Do you know which free Refugio I should choose to make the full circuit or I can follow your itinerary as well. Also before that, there are just silly money if you want do throw an Agency,  thousand of dollars, cheers. I have few question:What you think I will have enough time to do all the circuit?I am also booking the Refugio, I can see from the website Campmento Torres is closed, I think the main attraction of this tour is to see the sunrise at Los Torres…. so the only option is to stay Campamento Chileno, where you pay at least 100 uds…..great!I have gears, the only things I will rent is tents and sleeping bag, and about food I will buy everything in Puerto Natal, which in all the Refugio, it is silly money…….That’s for now.Any advice or help will be appreciate.Thanks and Regards,Francesco. I did 8 days for the full O, and you do have to pay to camp but it’s not much. If you only do the W then you can manage to only do free campsites but for the O you will need to pay once or twice. If you go in mid-march, check the date, you might not have to book anything ahead of time or get a permit. I was there just after the cutoff. I didn’t pay thousands of dollars – more like a hundred or so. I had my own gear but you can rent from erratic rock. Hi Kristin,  I have three weeks off in March and have been trying to figure out where I want to travel. I read this particular article awhile back and now I am debating on doing the O hike.  I was wondering if I needed to know Spanish well and what website I should go to reserve the campsites? I was also wondering if it was possible to rent gear or if I am better off hauling all my camping gear with me?  Thanks,Sydney Depending on when you go in March you might not have to book ahead. I went towards the end and it was after the permit/booking season. It would help if you spoke Spanish but it’s not necessary in TdP. There is enough tourism that you can easily find English speakers. You can also rent gear at Erratic Rock. Hi Kristin,  It’s Sydney again. I am trying to book the rest of my campsites through Vertice Patagonia and their website isn’t allowing me to see if their availability. I have emailed and facebooked them regarding the problem and they respond with an automatic email that isn’t related to this issue.  This is my dream trip and I want to make sure I do it right. As much as I would like to go in March I am scared if I don’t make the reservation in advance, I won’t be able to do the trek. I was wondering your thoughts and if you had any advice? I am not sure what year you went, but it seems as if it’s getting more popular and the park is harder to visit. I was planning to do the ” O circuit” March 25th to April 2nd. Hmm, I went right around that time 2 years ago and it was after the required permitting time, so I didn’t book anything in advance and I wasn’t required to. I never had any problems. I also carried my own gear so all I needed was a plot of ground for camping. That might be why. Next I would try calling them just to see if that works better. If you have a Spanish-speaking friend who can make the call for you that would be best. Hey there Kristin.  You ROCK!  You are such an inspiration!  I really Love how you’re living your life….After all, we only get 1 life to live, and this one isn’t a dress rehearsal. I really appreciate all the work that you put into this site; there’s a wealth of information. It has helped much.My questions to you are more technical in nature.  Is there a map showing distances between the various campsites? How about elevation deltas?  A Topo map would be helpful too. This info would help me enormously. I am a real backpacker who regular goes backpacking in the woods on multi-day trips, without and sort of campsite or support.  I always follow the “Leave no trace” guidelines.  In reading your blog here, its too bad that I won’t be allowed to camp out in the “Bush”.  Have you heard of anyone “Ghost” or “Stealth” camping in the park?Thanks, Robert Hey Robert – the trail is very easy to find. In fact if you manage to get lost I’d be impressed. My buddy Steve did a nice campsite map on his site: https://www.back-packer.org/trekking-guide-how-to-hike-the-circuit-in-torres-del-paine-patagonia-chile/ As for bush camping: The reason why they’re not OK with it is two major fires that were caused by campers in the past. They both devastated the park and you can still see the evidence of both when you hike. They only want people to camp and cook in designated areas – the wind is just too strong and if one thing goes wrong it becomes unmanageable very quickly. Fair enough, right? Thanks for the kind words by the way! Howdy, Kristin!Your solo female travel blog is incredibly helpful for an aspiring solo female trekker like myself! I’ve been on a couple of journeys solo and have recently booked a trip down to Patagonia to tackle the O Circuit from April 3-10, 2018. I’ve emailed Vertice Patagonia (one of the campamento booking websites), and they told me that all of their campsites typically on the O circuit will be closed by the end of March. I’m worried 🙁 Does this mean I can no longer plan to do the full O itinerary? Or is there a way you know of to still go for it? Any feedback would be extremely helpful! Keep on inspiring! 😀 Weird – I went at the end of March. I know it’s weather dependent of course but it’s possible you might want to move it up a week or two if you can just to be sure. What an awesome blog post! So grateful for your effort in sharing this knowledge. My parent and I are new to hiking but will be doing the W in mid April. I’ve not been able to find the answer to this (perhaps naive) question – should we have a plan for what to do if a blizzard comes through when we are between Refugios? We won’t have a tent so are concerned about safety planning. Is this likely to happen and if so, what would be the general way to handle it? Thanks in advance! Usually you’ll get delayed. If it’s more severe I’m not actually sure. Hi! How safe is it to do the W trek as a woman alone? How can I find accommodation along the trek if I want to avoir camping?  Thanks You can find refugios but you need to book them as far in advance as possible to get a space. I would do it alone no problem. There are lots of other hikers with you so you never have to be alone 🙂 Hi,I was just wondering what do you do with all of your other clothes etc. That you don’t need for the hike? I noticed you only mentioned your hiking gear and food Thanks! Stored them at the Hotel Las Torres where I stayed after the hike. They have a storage room. Otherwise store in town at the guesthouse you stay at before your trek and obviously book them for after as well to make it worth it for them to store your stuff. Hi Kristin, I’m doing the full circuit at the end of December-January; plan is to stay at the Hotel Las Torres afterwards – do they let you store your things there for free if you are staying with them? I also have a guesthouse that I’m staying at before/after that I could keep the gear. Finally – what excursions did you take at the Hotel? Definitely want to include horseback riding but also looking at your pictures – I want to see those views and the waterfalls. Suggestions? Thanks in advance. Yes you can store your things there – I did. I did the Full Paine and the Las Pumas and one day of horseback riding – did 3 in total 🙂 a great blog.  We are planning on doing the W trek in  the first week in november.We are looking at camping as an option of accommodation instead of the refugios.Would you recommended camping or would it be very cold with one sleeping bag.  Thanks in advance If you have a sleeping bag that can handle it then you’re good! If You have few days, you can do one tour called “full day” , in 6 hours you can go to the “base torres ” ( is the only point where you can see the towers) but is a hard tracking If you go with the hotel las torres you can take horses for part of it as well. Hey there . Have one question. I want to go in November for the full circuit , but camp Grey is full. They told me you can’t skip two camping places because they won’t let you in. I mean, it is there like a guardian of the Park and he/she will check your every reservation and  won’t let you even if you want to sleep maybe next to a tree for a night or something like that  ?:) You have to camp in designated camping areas. If you skip I suppose that’s proof to them that you camped outside of a designated area and yes they are VERY strict about that because they’ve had two massive fires in the parks in the past from people cooking and now everyone has to cook in the same sheltered area to prevent it from happening again. They limit numbers because there’s only so much space and facilities. It gets more popular and harder to get camping spots each year unfortunately. HI! The photos are amaaaaazing!I’m planning to do this, is there enough wood on the trek so I can be OK with a twig stove?Thanks!Simon That’s a huge no-no in TdP. They’ve had two massive fires so nobody is allowed to cook outside of the cooking areas in camps and it has to be a gas stove.  In general in Patagonia you can’t burn any wood you find since there’s not enough of it to regenerate the topsoil if it gets burned, plus the wind is so crazy fires get out of control really fast. Hope that helps! Hi there !What an amazing article !  I have a question regarding the places that are only accessible by car.We are doing the W circuit from Refugio Grey to hotel las torres.We would like to go to the campground Pehoe after that and do some day hike around there (or wherever it’s beautiful) but we were wondering how we can do it if we arrive by bus the first day.Renting a car from Puerto Natales on day 1 and leave it there for 5 days without using it seems expensive just to have freedom a couple days after the W circuit.  Do we have other options ?thank you You can probably book a day tour in town which might be cheaper, camp overnight there, then get transport to wherever you want to start hiking the next day. Hi,i m intending to do the O in March 2018. Is it possible to stay at a place for 2 days or even longer? Im 66 then but in a good condition. . Thank you for some informationGünter Should be, you just have to book ahead of time. Hi, thank youwhich places are worth staying for more than 1 night? I would personally finish the trek then stay at the Hotel Las Torres for more than one night. Thank you Kirstin,how many rainy days did you have? Are the bookingpages reliable? It rains almost daily but it comes and goes. That’s Patagonia! Hi, Thank you so much for sharing this! It’s really helpful. Just a question, if we want to travel on November of next year. When would recommend to start booking campsites? I cant seem to figure out if you can just book anytime for the 2019-2020 season now or there’s a specific time when you can start booking for the 2019-2020 season? Your help would be much appreciated! Regards, Olive That I’d ask the companies directly for info on since I’m really not sure about when to book and the best timing. That changes all the time. Hi there, I am doing TDP O circuit in March. Did you prepacked your meal at home before you travel in Chile, did you had any problem getting them check in the airport. I planned to dehydrate my own meal to be cost effective. Do you have any recommendations? I’d be careful with that because they’re super strict about bringing food into the country. Any meat, vegetables, cheese, etc. is not allowed. I recommend buying food locally. I’m not sure it’s really that much more than at home to be honest. Hi Kristin! A year and a half ago, having just come off the Inca Trail, I googled best treks in the world and came upon your Torres del Paine post. I can’t even count the number of times my sister and I read this post as we prepared for the O Circuit. We just completed it 3 weeks ago and it was one of the most incredible experiences! Your advice and input was spot on. I enjoy following your blog and your Instagram, thanks for sharing your travel stories! Yayyyy that’s awesome! So lovely to hear that. Thank you for coming back to comment and letting me know!! Thank you for the wonderful details and inspiration. I would like to save money by camping and bringing my own gear on the O trek. However, is it necessary to bring gas canisters and a small grill for cooking? Is there any chance the refugios simply provide hot water so that I can rehydrate/cook instant meals? Hi Rachel! Glad you like the post. I think you probably should bring your own grill and canister. Some might be happy to provide hot water but if any of them can’t or say no, then you’ll be in a tough situation. You might be able to ask others in camp but remember that would be using fuel they carried and they might not have enough to share. Great tips and info! Planning a February 2020 trip for my bday!! Hello,Thanks for all this awesome information!My partner and I are planning on hiking the O in February 2020. We are still debating between bringing our own gear from Canada, which knowing that we will be travelling for 6months in south America might mean a few logisitcs. Renting in Puerto Natales or renting within the park. I see that you rented in the park, and wanted to know if you sometimes regretted not having your gear with you to be more flexible?ThanksAmber In one case I brought all my gear from home, the first time I backpacked the O. The second time I didn’t rent the gear in the park – it was tents that were already set up and I booked them like you’d book a hotel room. They set them up for you. I definitely like not having to carry the stuff! You can only stay in campsites to flexibility on the O isn’t really an option anyways. Hi Kristen, I am trying to plan a trip to Patagonia but can’t spend more than a week there.  I read in one of your posts that there are 5 trails where you can see the ice field, but the only two mentioned are Huemel and the back of the O.  We don’t have time for the O and the Huemel looks to be a bit much for me. What are the other 3?  I can’t find that information anywhere! Thanks! I’m not actually sure what the others are. There are companies in El Chalten that will take you to the glacier but then you camp on and sleep on it, too. Those might be even more intense. Overall El Chalten is great though and if you want to see big glaciers, Perito Moreno is huge. Hi there,What a great post! I am a 28yo Australian woman hoping to trek the O solo in February.I wonder if you can give some indication of how busy the route usually is? I’ve done hikes in NZ where there’s 40 people per day who do the same part of the trek as you, then you all meet up again at the huts/campsites for the night, and felt totally safe doing that as there were plenty of people. Is it a bit like that on the O? Would you say it is a safe trek to walk solo as a woman? Best wishes You won’t be the only one for sure. I am hesitant to ever say hiking alone is safe because there are risks associated with it. Obviously if you have a problem and you’re alone there’s nobody around to see it. Totally your call. I do have a women’s trip in March you can join if you want to be in a group: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-travel-tours/ Hi Kristen, My wife and I are planning to go to Patagonia and found your website extremely helpful (thank you for that). You recommended that people book ahead during peak season for Torres Del Paine. There were a ton of options and areas for camping. If we were hoping to do the 2 week trek (W, Glacier, French Valley, Torres), is there a particular order for (i) the treks and (ii) camping areas you would recommend? Fantastico Sur has multiple sectors and we weren’t sure if there was a logical order needed. Thank you! Regards,Dennis Hi Dennis, if you do the O circuit you must do the trek in order, working reverse chronologically on a clock. Here’s an itinerary to help: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-o-circuit-itinerary/ My friend and I are hiking the O Circuit.  He already booked everything and he sent me an Itinerary from you.   Anyway, can you help me with a few questions that I have? I arrive in Arenas Chile (PUQ airport) at 2pm on Sunday November 24.   We start the hike on Nov 26th in Seron.   How do I get from PUQ to Seron?Where should we stay the night of Nov 24 and Nov 25?How much money/cash should I bring? You’d need to take the bus from PUQ to Puerto Natales. You can do so from the airport I’m pretty sure. The next morning, take the bus to the park and walk to seron from central camp/welcome center. Thank you thank you thank you!! Such an incredible and useful post. You’ve answered questions that I’ve looked for through and through on google. I’m excited to trek this circuit in December. Yay have fun! Hi Kristin, I have just come across your blog whilst researching my upcoming trip to Patagonia. In April of 2020 I am going to pack in my job and go travelling for a few months and the general plan is to begin in Patagonia and work my way up towards Peru and then to Mexico. I won’t lie, I am a little confused/bamboozled by all the advice out there and the websites and was hoping you might be able to help me on a few things. I hope you don’t mind but I’ve listed out some questions that I was hoping you would be able to answer some of them… – I 100% want to do the O route. I have done Kilimanjaro and EBC and know that I can get round the O route. That being said, I don’t know how comfortable I am trekking by myself and sleeping by myself.– How safe did you feel and did you meet people along the way?– Are there tour groups that do the O route?– Is the route clearly marked?– If I stay at the pre set up tent will there be other people around and do they do food/sleeping bag etc?– I am planning on starting my travels in June. Is that too late? I’m ok with the cold…– How easy was it to get from the airport and arranging your permits etc? There are groups that do the O. It is clearly marked and you probably will meet people, however you can’t trek it anymore after April due to snow. You’d be in Patagonia during winter if you start in June, and most trails will be impassable. Thanks for this great guide! It’s been so helpful when planning our trip. You briefly mentioned the bathroom situation but I wanted to clarify so we’re fully prepared. There are bathrooms available on the trail? Yes at every camp! HI Kristin,  I am looking to just do the W as I am working with some time constraints. Is it too much to go Puerto Natales > Paine Grey on Day 1 (overnight at Paine Grey), Paine Grey all the way to Camp Frances Day 2, then Day 3 go up the Frances Valley to Mirador Britanico in the morning then hike to Chileno in the afternoon? Finally Day 4 do the torres in the morning and back to puerto Natales in the afternoon? I am a fairly quick hiker and since there is limited availability for camping I may end up staying in the refugios (which would at least lighten the pack). Just want to make sure I’m not biting off more than I can handle.  Any input is helpful, thanks! Do you mean Refugio Grey or Paine Grande? If you start at Paine Grande I think yes, but then you would not have time to hike backwards towards Grey. You could consider cutting out the French valley if you really want to add on Grey. great blog.. i did the O in 2012 and again this mid december.were you able to travel with gas canisters in the flight? or you purchased them in natales?also do you have better markings now for the path? You can’t fly with gas canisters, but you can buy them on the ground. I didn’t have any trouble following the path. Hi Kristin – super blog overall and a great post on TDP. Thank you. At short notice I got some time off and am looking at arranging a faster-than-normal, solo O-circuit in late Feb. I realize this might just not be feasible given prior bookings. Nevertheless, would you recommend any outfitters or travel agents that are creative and would be willing to try to structure a custom trip at short notice? Many thanks in advance for your advice – Tim Hey Tim – I can help you out. I’ve sent you an email.  It might be hard to get bookings last minute, but we can try to be creative 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/torres-del-paine-o-circuit-itinerary/,The Perfect 9-Day Torres del Paine O Circuit Itinerary,Chile,"The O Circuit in Torres del Paine National Park in Chile is easily the most famous trail in Patagonia. Though the towers in the park earned it such renown, it’s the ever-changing landscape on each day of the trail that has made me fall in love with it enough to hike it twice. My first time, I backpacked it carrying all of my own gear. The second time, I brought a group of 16 women with me and had a more luxurious experience. Both options are detailed below. Based on two experiences on the O Circuit now, this is my perfect itinerary, which can be done in 8 or 9 days, finishing with the crown jewel, the Torres: I highly recommend beginning the hike at the Welcome Center, or the Hotel Las Torres if you’ll be sticking around after, so that your ending point is the Torres – the towers that made the park famous and its namesake. The trail will be obvious, as it always is on this hike, departing from the Welcome Center and central camp. The hike on day one is fairly mild over a mostly dirt track, passing through brief forested areas and gaining and losing some elevation before flattening out for the final stretch to Serón. The views are a nice indication of what’s to come, though I rarely take my camera out on this day since the best of the best comes in the following days. Day two starts out along a lovely blue river before taking you up your first small pass early on in the day. I typically find day two to be pretty long, but if the weather is clear it can be spectacularly beautiful, passing by the dazzling blue Lago Paine before descending down to the first check point, the Conaf ranger station in Coiron. This is a good place for a bathroom and potential lunch break before continuing on through a combo of open pampa and a marshy, often muddy, trail. Prepare for potentially heavy winds on the pass and mentally gear up for a muddy traverse over a few wooden boards and sometimes-narrow logs before you make your way up the hill to Dickson – a truly beautiful sight. This is my personal favorite camp of the entire circuit purely because of the location. You’re fully surrounded by glacier-covered peaks and on the lake with the Dickson glacier just behind the campsites.  I look forward to the hike from Dickson to Los Perros for the opportunity to walk in the forest all day and for the shorter distance following day 2.  This is the one day of the trip that you’ll spend almost entirely in the trees, with a lovely viewpoint after a steady upward climb within the first 2 hours. From there you’ll meander through the woods – full of moss-covered trees and several small bridges, to the Los Perros glacier. Be sure to stop by the mirador to the left before getting into camp. I recommend taking your time leaving Dickson on day 3, as Los Perros is a very basic camp and not nearly as beautiful as Dickson. However I wouldn’t attempt the pass from any other camp than Los Perros, as day 4 is a long day with an early departure. There’s no sugarcoating it – day four is long and difficult, however it’s my favorite day of the entire trek because of the truly breathtaking views of the Grey Glacier. On a clear day you’ll be able to see clear to the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third largest frozen body of fresh water in the world. This is one of only four trails in Patagonia, including the Huemul Circuit, where you can see the ice field. I would recommend leaving Los Perros right at sunrise, or even slightly before, to take on day four. You’ll want to go at a steady march and take short breaks in order to make it to Grey. I always pity those who only do the W on this day. There’s simply no substitute for the experience of seeing the ice field as you cross the pass, and walking next to it all day long. I personally don’t feel the uphill is all that bad, but you’ll descend double the distance you ascend (nearly 1200 meters), in order to make it down to Refugio Grey. The downhill can be steep, muddy, and unrelenting. Just keep looking at the view of the ice field to get you through! Another part I love are the three suspension bridges. They make for an epic photo op! Note: You can certainly break this day up and camp at Paso instead of hiking all the way to Grey. Paso is even more basic than Los Perros with a hole in the ground for a toilet and no tents, so it’s only open to backpackers carrying their own tents. If you can make it to Grey, I’d recommend that over Paso based on personal preference. Day 5 can be shorter or longer depending on how you think you’ll feel after the long distance on day 4. The first time I did the O, I hiked it in 8 days by combining days 5 and 6. However for my most recent hike, I decided to take it easier with the group and break it up into two, more leisurely days, making it a 9 rather than 8-day circuit. Day 5 meanders through the part of the park that was torched by the 2011 fire. It’s eerily beautiful as you climb past the burnt, silvery tree remains past several viewpoints that look back at the Grey Glacier and down on the Lago Grey, finishing at Paine Grande. Paine Grande is a huge refugio that’ll feel decadent after the smaller and more basic camps. I also find that it can be an overwhelming change going from the relative quiet of the O to the more popular and populous W. Still, if you want to get some WiFi and have access to more amenities, Paine Grande is a gorgeous refugio right on a lake. Continuing along the lake, the trail is fairly easy without much elevation gain or loss as you make your way towards Los Cuernos, the horn-like mountains that come in second in terms of fame to the towers. The first time I hiked the O, I stayed at the more basic and free CONAF campsite, Italiano, as Francés was closed. This time the opposite was true, though having now stayed at both I can confirm that Francés is much nicer. It’s my second favorite camp after Dickson in terms of lake views, the incredible showers and bathrooms, and the forest vibe.  If you do hike to Francés, you’ll have to backtrack by about 30 minutes to hike back to Italiano and through the Valle Francés to the Británico Lookout the next day. I’d say this is worth it and not a big deal as Francés is so much nicer than Italiano, assuming both are open and you have the choice. This is the hike that makes the W into a W, with an out-and-back hike through the Valle Francés to the Británico Lookout. If you slept at Campamento Francés, you’ll need to backtrack to Campamento Italiano to hike up through the valley. The good news is you can leave your heavy pack either at Francés or at the ranger station at Italiano since it’s an out-and-back day hike. This day can feel pretty long, with some steep and rocky parts as you make your way to the Británico Lookout. Is it worth it? I love this hike and think it’s a gorgeous view of several glaciers and striking rock formations, however I recommended to members of my group who were struggling with blisters or sore knees to sit it out if it meant they’d struggle to see the towers on the final morning, which is the crown jewel of the park. After finishing, you’ll make your way back past Francés to pick up your pack and make your way to Los Cuernos. The hike has a brief uphill climb before descending down to the Lago Nordenskjöld. You’ll walk along the rocky shore for the rest of the hike. Day 8 can sometimes feel long and unrelenting, especially if it’s a sunny day. I found it more difficult the first time I did it than the second time, perhaps due to my pack weight. The hike takes you along the gorgeous greenish blue Lago Nordenskjöld before coming to a break in the trail that will either take you back to the Hotel Las Torres/Campamento Central, or up towards Chileno/Las Torres. This is where you’ll start to climb sharply upwards to make it to Chileno. Campamento Chileno is my least favorite of the trip since it feels cold and the mats in the tent were thin, though their refugio is nice and has delicious food. If you take your time you’ll probably arrive too late to try to make it to the base of the towers in the same day, as the trail closes at 3pm for any upward traffic. They also like to have everyone off the trail before sunset, which is a change from when I hiked the trail 3 years ago. At the time of this writing, Campamento Torres, the closest camp to the towers, is closed to campers, making Chileno the closest. It’s a small campsite and the hardest to get reservations at, so as soon as you know that you want to do this hike, be sure to reserve a spot. The next morning, either hike in with the stars or wait until the sun is out to make the final ascent to the towers. It’s about a 2-2.5 hour hike entirely uphill. It can be tricky in the dark and I do not recommend doing it solo as it can be easy to lose your way or encounter a puma. Since I’d already done this portion of the trail twice I took the part of my group that felt like waking up early (3:30am to be exact) and made a quick march up to the top with headlamps. The rewarding Milky Way through Las Torres was awe-inspiring. Better yet, we were the only ones there for about an hour until the sun started to rise. If you can possibly reserve a camping spot at the Torres campsite should it reopen, this would be a much more logical starting point if you wish to hike up for sunrise. This would also add an extra 3 km to day 8, making it a pretty long day. Having done both, I can’t really give the edge to one over the other, though if I could make the choice I’d probably go for the Torres campsite for ease and location as a backpacker, though it’s a lot more basic. If you’re using refugios and tents that are provided by the camp, you will have to stay at Chileno. From there, make your way downhill past Chileno to pick up your pack and onwards to the Hotel Las Torres or Central Camp. I personally stay at the Hotel Las Torres for a couple of days after each circuit. It’s comfortable, gives you a chance to decompress, and the food is incredible. I’ve done the Full Paine bus tour with the boat ride to the Grey Glacier twice as well, and have enjoyed it both times. Yes, it’s expensive but the central campsite is surprisingly terrible and there’s not much of a middle ground in the park. The times listed in this post are all subjective and don’t take any personal pacing, breaks, and obvious stopping points at lookouts or viewpoints into consideration. It will most certainly take you longer if you love photography or move at a slightly slower pace. You can also do it all much more quickly if you rarely take breaks and hike at a faster pace, though I don’t see much point in arriving at camp super early for no real reason. The distances are also a bit blurry, as different maps show different distances for the exact same trail. On the John Gardner Pass day, for example, I’ve seen as much as a 5 km discrepancy! My best advice is to honor what you think you can realistically do and leave early enough in the morning to take it easy on long days. Torres del Paine National Park grows exponentially in popularity year over year. Since it’s a short season, running from November to the end of March, realistically not everyone will be able to get permits and camping spots. Camping reservations are required in order to begin the hike, and are strictly enforced. There is no camping outside of the campsites. It’s also essential to get park permits. Since only 80 people are permitted to begin the O circuit each day, it’s essential to book as soon as you know you’re going to do the hike. I met so many people on the trail who had inconvenient or illogical camping reservations since everything was booked out by the time they planned their trek. You can book about half of the campsites and refugios through Fantastico Sur and half through Vertice. They’re not super responsive and this part can be very annoying, but you have to just keep trying! It’s also easier to get help from Fantastico Sur to book the entire trip, particularly if you book with the Hotel Las Torres for before or after the hike. *You can also sign up for my email list to be the first to find out when I run this tour again – tours are open to women of all backgrounds and are limited to 16 participants, including reserved tents and nights in the Hotel Las Torres. The next thing you’ll need to think about is where you’ll sleep each night. Most of the campgrounds have tents that are already set up with mats and sleeping bags, as well as towels for the showers. When you buy a package, they also provide all meals, significantly lightening your pack load. Alternatively, you can stay in the refugios, which are heated and available in dorm-style bunks. Though I’ve never stayed in the refugios, I have both backpacked and stayed in the provided tents. Backpacking is, obviously, much harder since you’ll have a pack load of about 45-50 lbs, though it’s significantly cheaper. You can also elect to eat some of your meals in the refugios from time to time, depending on availability. Though I love backcountry backpacking and do it often, I thoroughly enjoyed being able to have a lighter pack for this hike and to be able to sit back and let someone else cook for me. The sleeping bags were also cleaner than I expected, though I’d still bring a sleeping bag liner. If you do decide to backpack, check out this article on how to prepare for a backpacking trip including food and gear. The best way to get to the park is to depart on the 7am bus from Puerto Natales. You can book this in person several days ahead of time at the bus station, or book online ahead of time. You’ll be dropped of at the park HQ to watch a fire safety video and check in. They’ll give you a map of the park and double-check your permits. From there, get on another shuttle bus bound for the Welcome Center/Hotel Las Torres. Depending on what you decide to do in terms of accommodation, your preparation will be different, however some things will remain the same. You’ll have to pack waterproof gear, lighten your load as much as possible, and prepare for truly crazy winds and weather. You can read more about how to prepare for the O circuit in Torres del Paine here, with more backpacking tips based on my first experience hiking the O. This hike was so beautiful, it’s worth doing over and over again. The second time through felt totally different due to the weather, light, and the company. The O is a truly stunning experience that you’ll never forget. Last week I had to write a pretend itinerary for a trip for a Spanish course I’m taking and happened to discover Torres del Paine and wrote on that. Then I find this on your page…looks like a sign!! 😉 Your pictures are amazing! Maybe you should do it for real! How far in advance would you recommend booking? 1 year? 2? I’m not sure they’re organized enough for 2 years in advance but a full year should be great. Cool, thanks! I am starting my research now for a trip in 2020 for the solar eclipse. Do you think it would be possible to do just the second half of this, so it’s only 4 or 5 days? Yep that would be the W and you can do so by taking the boat to Glacier Grey and backtracking to Las Torres or visa versa. Thanks for all the insight. I am excited to do this hike but have one question I cannot seem to find the answer too. Once we finish the hike and end up back at Laguna Amarga, we plan on getting the bus that morning (11:00/11:30 am) and heading to Puerto Natales to catch a 3:15 pm flight.  Do you think this is possible? I do not know if the bus drops people off at the airport, or if they just continue right to the town center and then we have to taxi back up. Any insight would be appreciated! Thank you. So I have never flown out of that airport. By the time I’ve been there in the season they don’t run flights out of that airport anymore, unfortunately. However the bus takes about two hours, barring any kind of delay. I’d potentially risk it if I wasn’t trying to catch an onward international flight, but personally that would be a bit too close for comfort. Hi Kristin, I was wondering how was the traffic on the O trek when you did your hike? I know it’s supposed to be less crowded than the W trek, but would you still meet fellow hikers continuously on the trail on a daily basis, or would you go by not seeing anyone for days? Thanks! You’ll see other people, and it’s the same trail as the W for 5 days of it 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-blog/,The Ultimate Patagonia Guide,Chile,"If you love the outdoors and rugged nature, it’s hard to think of a better destination than Patagonia. Split between Argentina and Chile, Patagonia is home to the world’s most beautiful hikes, is a mecca for rock climbers, and is even the jumping off point for Antarctica. Considering it’s a fairly large region, it can be overwhelming to figure out when to go, where to start, and which activities to pack in. After spending two months there myself, I put together a comprehensive guide to give you an idea of what is a must-see, how to prepare, and when to go. Without further ado, here is my full Patagonia guide:  There is no wrong time to visit Patagonia, though you will have a lot more access to the trails and activities if you visit during the summer months. The highest season is between December and March, though November and April are lovely months as well. Just keep in mind that dependent on the year, November and April can be somewhat risky because of snow closing some of the trails, though the spring and the autumn are beautiful. If visiting in the winter, prepare for a different experience. In Argentina’s Bariloche, it’s the perfect time to go skiing. In the rest of Patagonia, though, plan on sleepier towns, fewer open activities, and limited options for things to do. Weather-wise, when it comes to Patagonia, the best thing to do is prepare for anything. The region is known for incredibly strong winds, sometimes reaching over 100 km/h, and storms that can materialize out of nowhere and disappear just as quickly. While it can be warm, don’t expect hot summer weather that you might encounter closer to the equator. When it comes to dressing for the weather in Patagonia, plan on wearing things that are waterproof, including your hiking boots, and prepare for the possibility of freezing temperatures.  As anyone who fell in love with the concept of visiting Patagonia from 180° South knows, there are many ways to get there, including sailing. But for those of us who stick to more accessible means, the best way to get there is to fly or take a bus. Buses in South America are generally quite comfortable and reliable. Though quality varies from company to company, most buses have the option to fully recline, called full cama, have bathrooms on board, and offer meals and snacks. As long-term buses go, South America must have some of the best in the world. If you can swing it, I recommend paying up for the nicest company. I usually find this out by doing a quick Google search for my intended route and reading reviews, or asking at my accommodation what they recommend. It’s usually possible to book your bus a day or two before at the bus station, or you can ask your accommodation to help you, or in some cases you can book online. The other option is flying. The thing about South America air travel is, while traveling within a country can be pretty cheap, as soon as you cross the border the prices jump up like crazy. I started my Patagonia journey in Bariloche, Argentina, so the most logical place for me to fly into was Buenos Aires, and then to catch an onward flight from there. If you plan to stick to Chile, you will most likely be flying via Santiago. That leads to the next question: Where should you start?  Should you begin your adventure in Chile or Argentina? The short answer is it doesn’t really matter. Bariloche in Argentina is considered a sort of gateway to Patagonia, and a great place to begin your journey if going from north to south, as I did. Alternatively, you can fly from Buenos Aires down to El Calafate if you’re more interested in the Perito Moreno glacier, and checking out the national parks down south like Torres del Paine and the Fitz Roy in El Chaltén. Some choose to fly into the southernmost point, Ushuaia, and head north from there. Alternatively, if traveling within Chile, it probably makes the most sense to fly directly to either Puerto Montt if traveling the Carretera Austral or Punta Arenas if you plan to go directly to Torres del Paine. Right now these might seem like a lot of names without any real idea attached to what they are, so let’s go into the best things to see in Patagonia in the next section to help you figure out where you’d like to go. The following are some of the best things to see in Patagonia, in order of my personal favorites. While everyone is different, these are some of the most impressive things that I saw and that I think you’ll love too:  For many, this is the crown jewel of Patagonia. For those who love hiking and are ready to give it a full 5 to 8 days, I highly recommend backpacking through the O circuit in this national park. You’re guaranteed to see incredible mountain formations, the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, which is only visible from four trails in Patagonia, and the incredible Torres, a series of three towers over a minty green-colored lake. There are so many beautiful things in between that we don’t have time to discuss here but if you think you might want to do this, check out my guide on how to hike the circuit in Torres del Paine.  A strong answer to Torres del Paine, El Chaltén is Argentina’s trekking capital. To me, this little town has it all. It’s quirky, the food is good, and it is surrounded by some of the most beautiful landscapes in Patagonia. The creators of the Patagonia label agree, featuring the Fitz Roy on their label. If you’re less interested in doing a multi-day hike, there are plenty of day hikes in the area, including the 4-day Huemul Circuit. This is one of the most beautiful, and most challenging hikes in Patagonia. There are several 1-day or 2-day options as well. You can read more about the best hikes in El Chaltén here.  Though remote, this road trip is one of the best adventures in Patagonia. Most travelers do not go down the Ruta 7, opting for the more well-trodden, however more boring Ruta 40 instead. It gets you down south quicker but to me this is a mistake because the Carretera takes you through some of the most wild, remote, and gorgeous scenery. Think hanging glaciers, gorgeous fjords, and people living a way of life that is more reminiscent of the past. You can click here for my full guide on driving the Carretera. I would give this one at least two weeks if you can!  The Perito Moreno glacier is one of the few advancing glaciers in the world, and regularly makes the news for having ice bridges and regular cavings fall dramatically into the lake it sits on. When you visit, you can take a boat, and or walk the length of a wooden boardwalk to take in the sheer size of this incredible glacier. It’s both humbling and awe inspiring. The glacier is about 30 km in length, 5 km wide and an average height of 73 m from the water to the top, though of course most of the glacier is underneath the water. Keep in mind that the glacier is not located in the town of the same name, confusing as that is. You will need to head to El Calafate to see it. The town itself is nothing to write home about, but the glacier is a must-see.  Bariloche is a town in the northern part of Argentinian Patagonia, which many consider the gateway of Patagonia. Reminiscent of Switzerland, the town is known for its chocolate and skiing. Although it’s touristy, some of the most beautiful lakes and hikes are located just outside of it.  You can read more about the best things to do in Bariloche here. Interested in seeing penguins? This is the perfect place to do just that. Book a day or a multi-day trip out to one of the islands to see the Emperor or Magellan penguin colonies.  As mentioned in the weather section, Patagonia can experience many different kinds of weather all in one day. The most important thing is to bring clothing that will keep you comfortable. For me, that meant hiking boots that would keep my feet dry, layers so that I was never too hot or too cold, and waterproof gear, especially for hiking. Prepare for temperatures that could remind you of a late winter, while allowing for the possibility of days that are more like a warm spring. You can read more about my ideal packing list here.  If you’re going to Patagonia and not planning on hiking then honestly what are you doing? All joking aside, I highly recommend working in plenty of hikes into your Patagonia experience because the most beautiful parts are only accessible by foot. Hiking in Patagonia does come with its own set of challenges. You can plan on the occasional challenge, encountering types of trail that might be totally different from what you’re used to, and of course the winds. Some hikes can be done as day hikes and those are a little bit easier, but if you plan on backpacking, have a look at my guide to trekking in Patagonia for all of the tips on how to be prepared. Additionally, these are the best hikes in Patagonia, ranging from half days to 8 days.  Your trip to Patagonia can be quite expensive or quite cheap depending on your travel style. In most of Patagonia, it’s possible to camp, hitchhike, and take buses. On the other side of things, you could fly more often, opt for higher-end accommodation, or even rent your own car to get around. It all depends on how much time you have, what your tolerance for discomfort is, and personal preferences regarding food. Would you prefer to eat out or are you willing to cook? Most accommodation is equipped with kitchens that are communal, so that makes it a bit easier if you are trying to save money. All of that said, Patagonia is not a budget destination, per se. Chile has the strongest economy in South America and if you are coming from Bolivia or Peru, prepare to break your wallet open a bit more in Patagonia. My personal spend was just over $53 USD per day, which was a mid-range, modest budget. You can read more here about what went into that and how you can save.  So with all of the information I’ve thrown at you, how can you plan out your perfect Patagonia trip? As this region becomes more popular, it’s becoming more important to book things ahead of time and have a rough idea of what your itinerary will be. For that reason I put together Patagonia itineraries from one week to one month with a few variations in between to help you get started. I hope you’re ready for the adventure of a lifetime in one of the most beautiful parts of the world. Patagonia is still one of my favorite trips after six years of traveling the world, and I can’t wait to go back.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/carretera-austral-patagonia-guide/,A Carretera Austral Adventure Guide,Chile,"As Patagonia pops up on the radar of more travelers, the once unknown parts get uncovered and the wild places become just a bit less wild. But there’s one route that fewer people know about, with gravel roads, a rural way of life, and some of the most impressive glaciers and mountain tops on planet Earth. I’m speaking of the Carretera Austral in Chilean Patagonia, Ruta 7, a road that not many travel down and yet it’s one of the best adventures in Patagonia. I traveled all along this 1240km (≈770-mile) road for two weeks, stopping to hike and explore the glaciers, painted mountains, and marble caves. These are some important tips to prepare for your trip, and the best things to do and see all along the Carretera Austral: Driving Conditions: Much of the road is gravel, however there is construction going on at any given time. This probably isn’t the best route to take if you’re on a time crunch, as it can be slow going at times. Weather can be unpredictable, as is the case in all of Patagonia, so plan on heavy wind, rain, potentially warm weather, and everything in between. Packing: For my full Patagonia packing list, click here. If you plan on hiking in Patagonia (which I hope you are, it’s amazing!) here are some important things to know.  Remoteness: This part of Chile is quite rural. It was only in the 80s that this route was completed, connecting towns that were previously only reachable by boat. Wi-Fi is limited as are grocery stores. If you have a car and wish to cook, which is possible in most refugios, go shopping in Puerto Montt before you take off. Most of what you will find along the route are small shops with avocados, bread, tomatoes, onions, some preserved meats and cheeses, and pasta. Otherwise, lamb (that famous Cordero Patagonico cooked on a spit) and steak are typically on offer in the towns. Know that if you are driving in from Argentina, you will not be able to bring any produce, meat, or animal products in with you. They take this quite seriously at the borders. Accommodation: While hotels and refugios are comfortable, don’t expect anything too fancy and make peace with the fact that in some towns, you won’t be able to book until you arrive. They run anywhere from $20-$100 per night. There is camping available all along the route. In towns expect to pay between $5-$10 per night with access to a shower and kitchen. Free camping is also an option along the route. Espanol: This trip will be much easier if you can speak at least a little bit of Spanish. For the most part, the locals along the way will not speak English. I found this was true in much of Patagonia and South America in general, which is great, as it provides an opportunity to learn! Car rentals: Most tourists who travel along the Carretera Austral choose to rent a car, picking up in Puerto Montt, or Coyhaique if you’re short on time, and dropping off at their chosen end point. You will of course have to pay for the privilege of not returning the car to where you got it, but it will save you considerable time. While the most expensive, this is by far the most convenient option. Buses: There are buses that run along the route, however they are infrequent and will often fill up in the previous destination, meaning they do not stop in the next town. Most buses only run a few times or just once per week. Hitchhiking: This is how I traveled along the Carretera a few years ago. This is actually a right of passage for young Chilenos and you’ll see plenty of hitchhikers along the road regardless of which mode of transport you choose. If you happen to have a car, consider giving a few rides, it’s a very common thing to do in Patagonia. You can read more about my hitchhiking tips here. Bicycle: Ready for a challenge on this mountainous, gravel road? If you choose to go this route, make sure your bike is ready to handle the rough roads and that you’re happy to cycle in all kinds of weather. Hats off to you, this is a true adventure! Most Carretera trips begin in Puerto Montt, which is a surprisingly dangerous city without many redeemable qualities to it. However this is where you’ll catch the ferry to Chaiten, which is the jumping off point for a few impressive national parks. The ferry ride itself is stunning. Make sure you bundle up because you’ll want to be out on the decks enjoying this one as you pass through the many fjords and waterfalls on the way. The journey takes about 10-12 hours and you’ll want to show up plenty early to board – give it at least an hour. Companies that offer this passage change from year to year and it’s possible to show up to the port/bus station and buy the ticket the day before you go, which is what I did. If you’d rather book ahead of time, you can do so here. After the ferry, you’ll end up in Chaitén, a town that was all but destroyed by a volcano in 2008. While everyone survived, as the town was evacuated in time, the evidence is still everywhere from the beach covered in volcanic ash to the houses still partially buried by the mud and debris. While the town is quaint and cute, the main things to see are outside of it. I regret that I didn’t explore Pumalín and Corcovado, as the locals expressed that both were lovely. If you have a car and some time, then be sure to walk through the temperate rain forests and marvel at the moss-covered trees. Both parks have camping and cabin options. Additionally, you can hike the Chaitén volcano, which is a steep but short climb that can be done in a few hours’ time. Futaleufú is the rafting capital of Patagonia. Though it’s about a 2 hour+ deviation from the Carretera Austral, it’s worth stopping by if you’re looking for an adrenaline rush. Join a one day rafting adventure, or join a hiking tour that takes you to stay in a dreamy looking treehouse. I wish I’d done this last time I went! This was my favorite stop on the Carretera, though I loved almost all of them, mostly because of its picturesque location on a lake, which is perfect for sunset, and of course, the Queulat hanging glacier. The higher walk to the glacier viewpoint at Queulat National Park is a fairly easy hike over a hanging bridge and through what will most likely be a quite muddy, however magical and mossy, forest. The viewpoint at the end is the cherry on top as you view the amazing hanging glacier. There’s a lower walk as well that takes you to a farther viewpoint, which is perfect for lunch and a good place to catch the boat through the lake to get a closer look at the glacier, if you fancy it. Without transport, you’ll have to hitchhike to the park, but it’s worth the hassle. I recommend spending at least a couple of days in Puyuhuapi before moving on. It’s so calm and quiet, I just adored it. As you make your way to Coyhaique, leave time to stop into the Bosque Encantado (enchanted forest) for some gorgeous mossy trees, similar to the ones you saw in Queulat but still worth seeing to break up the drive. Welcome to the first bigger town that you would have seen in days. This is a great place to stock up on any supplies you may need, use the internet, enjoy the pizza and craft beer scene if that’s your thing, and then get the heck out so that you can enjoy the smaller towns again. This tiny town was so welcoming and lovely. I’ll never forget the family I stayed with when I went, in a tiny little shack for a room, but the friendliest people you could hope to meet. You can read more about the story here. Be sure to do the hike to the Cerro Castillo while in town. Though there’s a multi-day hike from as far back as Coyhaique, you can also do it as a day hike from Villa Cerro Castillo along what used to be the emergency route. It’s steep, and you should budget most of the day for it, but the views are spectacular the entire way and the lake and glacier at the top are a stunning indication of what’s to come as you progress south. This was another favorite stop for me, as this town has so much to do! I absolutely loved the glacier hike on the Exploradores Glacier, which has many gorgeous caves and ice formations that I have never seen on a glacier since. I didn’t realize it back then, but this is a special and unique glacier. It’s also only been a tourist option for a few years, which I find pretty cool. Be sure to take a boat to the marble caves as well to see the patterns swirl in the rock over the baby blue colored water. This only takes a few hours and is a pretty cheap little trip, and so worth it. For both of these activities, it’s possible to show up and book in person the day before. You can read more here. This was a gorgeous drive from Puerto Rio Tranquilo to Parque Patagonia via Cochrane, winding by the Baker River. At the time that I visited, the park had just been established. Due to lack of transport since I was hitchhiking, I didn’t get a chance to check out this park but I sure will next time I’m in the area. The hikes look incredible. From here, you have a choice to make in terms of route. For anyone with a car, it makes the most sense to cross over into Argentina and continue down to El Chaltén, as the more you progress south, the longer you’ll have to drive back up to cross over into Argentina. If you’re hitchhiking or on a bicycle, then I highly recommend continuing down to Villa O’Higgins. The town is lovely and quiet, and from there you can take a boat, which stops by an impressive glacier on the way, stay overnight at a farm, then walk to El Chaltén. It’s quite the adventure that few people do! I particularly liked being able to take a boat up to a glacier on a ferry with so few people. That kind of intimate experience is harder to come by elsewhere in Patagonia. You’ll most likely have to carry everything you have if you go this route, though sometimes it’s possible to get a ride or take horses for part of the way. You can read more about how to do that here. By now you will have come to the end of the Carretera Austral, and though it may be a bit overwhelming at first to be back in a more major town with, like, real roads, you’re in for a treat, because the trekking capital of Argentina has so many amazing hikes that you’ll be occupied for weeks if you try out most of them. I have a full guide to hiking in El Chaltén here with everything from day hikes to the 4-day Huemul Circuit. From there, stop by El Calafate to see the massive caving Perito Moreno glacier, and onwards to the incredible Torres del Paine National Park in Chile.

Here’s a full map of the trip for your reference, though I highly recommend having the app maps.me downloaded, with the full Carretera Austral map already plotted out before you go given all of the time that you’ll be spending offline on the Carretera.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-packing-list/,The Perfect Patagonia Packing List,Chile,"So you’ve decided to go on the trip of a lifetime to Patagonia – good choice, you won’t be disappointed! Maybe you’ve heard a thing or two about the weather? About how it’s pretty intense and unpredictable? Not to worry! I’ve got you totally covered with this packing list and the best part is it doesn’t cost a fortune: Click on this kit for easy shopping! That’s my basic packing list, though we need to talk about backpacks and other essentials, too! First, let’s talk about what kind of weather to expect: I did not understand nor fully appreciate how truly, certifiably, insane the weather can be in Patagonia until I experienced it for myself. I had been told that the wind is so strong there that it can push you over, and I had even seen photos of people leaning into the wind. I still didn’t fully understand that it *actually* happens, and often. The best way to deal with this is by crouching down to the ground if it gets super strong, using hiking poles to stabilize yourself if it’s light enough to keep hiking in, lining your backpack with trash bags instead of using rain covers, which will just blow off, and using rocks to tie your tent down in addition to the stakes. It rains a lot in Patagonia too, which is totally fine, as long as you’re prepared for it with the waterproof gear mentioned in the list above. This is also why there were so many rainbows all the time. It’s the reason why the clouds are so unique and interesting there as well. If you have the right stuff for the weather you can actually enjoy it, but if not you could be miserable. When considering the size you need, evaluate if you’ll need to put a tent, sleeping bag, and food inside. If you’re on a trail like the W or O in Torres del Paine and your tent is already set up for you, then you don’t need much more than a 35L backpack for your water, camera, and personal items. However if you’re backpacking for multiple days and bringing all of your own food and equipment, you’ll need something closer to 70L. Check out my backpacking checklist or click the image below:   Go to a store that allows you to try the packs on with weight in them (I like REI in the US), or if that’s not available to you, order multiple bags online and return within the time window. Something like this bag is perfect for hiking and for traveling. If you want more options, I have a list here of the best multi-day hiking backpacks on the market. Also keep in mind that if you do overnight hikes, you’ll want to be able to store whatever you’re not bringing with you in town. Most places understand and are happy to store bags, as long as you stay with them before and after your hike. For this I’d bring a duffle bag that folds down easily in your backpack. I strongly suggest going for waterproof, at least ankle-high hiking boots meant for rocky terrain if you plan to hike while in Patagonia (and you should!) When hiking in the past, I’ve often just used the same shoes I would wear in the gym, but in Patagonia, I was glad every single day that I brought hiking boots. There were many times when I trudged through mud that was ankle deep, walked through running water, and climbed on sharp and jagged rocks. Such is the terrain in Patagonia and waterproof boots with some real tread are the safest and most logical option for that kind of hiking. I highly recommend these boots  – they’re cute and waterproof, with good tread, ankle support, and they’re meant to keep your feet warm in cold climates! This is where I always spend less in my travel wardrobe, because travel clothes are loved hard and die quickly. For hiking shirts, I still had some of my ski underwear, basically thermal shirts and long johns, with me from skiing and they actually came in really handy in Patagonia. It was supposed to be summer there but it is cold next to glaciers and we got snow at the end, too (which was actually really wonderful.) Otherwise, it was mostly leggings for hiking that I didn’t care about because those rocks are sharp and jagged and will tear everything. I also brought a couple of tunic dresses that I could put over leggings for wanting-to-look-nice situations. Otherwise it was mostly utility since my Patagonia trip was about the great outdoors (I’m guessing yours is, too). That’s what’s in my backpack for Patagonia, and I was super happy with all of the products that I brought along. I stayed comfortable even when it was raining and windy, and was able to enjoy two full months of hiking and playing in the wilderness in Patagonia. Do you normally travel with a pack that size? I am planning on doing some extensive travel and worry about having to check my only bag (and pay to check it too) since I have had airlines lose my bags in the past. Have you found airlines that let you carry it on?  Thanks! You can’t carry on over 35L and usually 7-10 kilos. I did have to travel with a pack this size in Patagonia because anything smaller and I couldn’t have fit my food. Maybe 50L would have been OK. I definitely go smaller when I travel anywhere else. Not sure what to suggest other than buying a bag that size once you get there (it’ll be expensive) or shipping home. Some good hints to remember, thanks! ? Great packing list, especially about all the warm underwear !! I live in Peru, so Patagonia is on our list. I definitely hope to be able to make it within the next year ! Thanks for the list ! Love your packing list! xo Loren  Hello there, what type of stove did you use? Thanks! It was like this: http://amzn.to/2edas4A You just attach the gas canisters to it 🙂 Thanks for this! My husband and I are heading to Patagonia is less than a month. How big was the backpack you brought? We will be doing alot of hiking, I have a 70 liter pack and a 55 liter and I’m torn on which one to bring. The 70 liter is a beast but I’m worried the 55 may be too small. I brought the 70L because for a weeklong hike I really did almost fill it. Better to have some excess space than to be cramming and stressing about it. Is it really that much heavier if you just don’t fill it all the way? Your pics are too dope, can’t wait to be there in a few weeks!! Hi! Where on earth did you get the ear warmer with the visor!! Leaving for Patagonia in two weeks and desperate for something to keep my ears warm, keep my face out of the sun, and allow me to wear my hair in a knot on my head. Amazing tips, thanks 🙂 I struggled to find a similar one on amazon. This is a $3 find from a tiny village in the Chinese Himalayas Of course it is 🙂 That’s amazing. 🙂 Thanks anyway! Hi,I don’t see in your list an extra pair of shoes, aren’t you worried to travel with only one pair? What would you do if anything happens? It can be the most expensive pair in the world and still tear… Hey Alex, now that you mention it, I had a pair of running shoes too, but I’d never use them hiking on those trails. It’s too much weight and space for me to travel with two pairs of hiking boots, and I would just have replaced them in Chile or Argentina if something happened to them. Hi Kristin,  I love your blog, and particularly all of your posts about Patagonia!! 🙂 I am doing a 12 month trip at the end of the year starting in Patagonia (for 2 and a half months) and am trying to decide on a pack that will suit trekking in Patagonia (including the full “O” circuit in Torres Del Paine) but also be ok for the rest of my time in South America, Europe and 3 months at the end in South East Asia. Do you think a 55L size pack (Osprey Ariel or equivalent) would be big enough for clothes, camping gear and food etc (if I left all other travel gear at a hotel before trekking)? I noticed you took a 70L and that you almost filled it… I just don’t know whether that will be too big for me for my whole trip as I’m pretty short (5ft 3) and prefer to minimalist pack. I really want to go for something smaller like the Kyte 46L for the rest of my trip but by the sounds of your post that might be way too small for Patagonia… Any suggestions would be great – thanks 🙂 Hey Caitlyn, you’d only need 35 liters if you were only going to Southeast Asia, but since you’re going to so many places you need stuff for really cold and really warm weather, and that makes it tough. The reason why my bag was full for the O was mostly because of food and the tent, and that’s not really something that you can cut down on. The other issue is wind. It’s incredibly strong and anything strapped to the outside will make you less aerodynamic. I would probably mail the big bag home after Patagonia and buy a smaller one in Europe if it were me. It’ll cost you, but it might be worth it not to have a 70L for the rest of the time. Hi Kristin! Curious as to the patterned vs dark leggings?  I tend to always buy dark and now I’m wondering why you suggest patterned? Thanks!! Oh just because they’re more fun! Just a style thing. Hides sweat and dirt nicely too! Gotcha, thanks for the response! Hi Kristin!Great list! I was wondering what time of the year your did your trekking in Patagonia? I will be going in December this year and I was wondering if I should still expect the unpredictable weather.Thanks! The weather will always be unpredictable, rainy, windy, and maybe even snowy, though I wouldn’t expect as much snow in December. I was there from February to the end of March. Hi Kristin,  I’ll be doing the O Circuit in late Nov.-early Dec. I’m planning to purchase a tent before the trip and was curious if you have a recommendation as to 3-season vs. 4-season. I know the winds can be really bad and I want to make sure I get something sturdy enough. I love your blog! Thanks! The winds are insane! I’d go with a tent made for wind rather than heat. Hi Kristin,Thanks for all your info. I am really looking forward to doing Carreterra Austral since reading it, hitchhiking like you did!Would you recommend to bring your own tent & sleeping bag for that? I don’t see it mentioned in your posts..Thanks,Carina It depends on if you want to backpack at all or not. You can also do it for cheaper if you’re willing to camp, but there are guesthouses all along the route.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/valparaiso-street-art/,"Valparaíso, Chile: The Most Artistic City in the World?",Chile,"The light breeze makes my walk along German Street in Valparaíso, a port city on the Chilean coast, a little more bearable in the afternoon sun as I walk along admiring the colorful houses and ocean view. There are kids sitting along curbs everywhere sketching. I can’t figure out if it’s a class assignment, or if this is just something that they like to do, but either way I love it. They’re applying their own impressions and artistic abilities to paper as they draw the houses, most with murals all over them, in their notebooks. Valparaíso is a colorful menagerie of narrow alleyways, spray painted self expression, and colorful houses up steep streets. There’s plenty to inspire the kids, and this big kid as well. This is not graffiti, this is fine art. Later that day I round a corner after following a narrow set of concrete stairs, purely out of curiosity, and find myself in some kind of labyrinth of sound and art as people play music involving a didgeridoo in the distance, and paintings line the top to the bottom of every wall. It’s officially the funkiest alleyway I’ve ever been in and I am digging it. Then, a voice enters my consciousness to my left as a local beckons me into his art gallery, where he offers me hot mate (mah-tay) tea as a friend offering. The gallery is more of a dilapidated room in an old house full of all manner of funky and inspiring sculptures and canvases. The ceiling is peeling and the floorboards creek, but he has a million-dollar view and it has charm. It’s obvious that it’s a hangout spot, and he tells me that it doubles as a vegan restaurant by day. I can’t believe a city like this exists. It’s characterized by tall and narrow streets with tall and narrow houses and funiculars, and in some ways reminds me of San Francisco, (which would make sense given its nickname is ‘little San Franciso’). The entire historic district is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and it has more murals than I have ever seen in my life. I couldn’t find an exact count but safe to say it’s in the tens of thousands of individual paintings ranging from simple tagging to gigantic, elaborate murals. The graffiti scene in Valparaíso started as a form of protest against the dictator Augusto Pinochet. During that time, self-expression, including art and painting, was repressed. After the dictatorship ended, government officials decided to make street art legal and it blossomed in the city. Why Valparaíso in particular? For that we have to peek back into history. Valparaíso was one of Chile’s major port cities in the 19th century given it was on the route that connected the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by the Strait of Magellan. The construction of the Panama Canal in the late 20th century caused an economic decline in  Valparaíso as the industry moved, and wealthy Chileans left for nearby Viña del Mar or Santiago while artists and foreigners remained. Street art began to flourish in Valparaiso’s hills and alleyways due to the heavy artistic influence of the people living in the city. My guide on the free street art tour (highly recommended!) also mentioned that Valparaíso’s narrow alleyways made it easy for artists to tag the walls and make a quick getaway. In present-day Valparaíso street art is not only encouraged but revered. Much of the art displays are mutually beneficial for both the artist and the hostel, restaurant, or shop owner. The artist is paid to create a mural and the hostel owner gets some beautiful, unique branding for his or her business. It’s a delightful exchange that you see in some other cities around the world as well that are big for street art and it’s nice to experience here, too. Though the city never fully rebounded economically (watch your purse when you’re out! There are pickpockets galore), tourism thanks to the street art keeps the city afloat these days. Major names display their art throughout the city, such as the incredibly talented, local Inti Castro, Teo Doro who draws inspiration from Van Gogh, Charquipunk whose birds had me in awe, and I even saw 1up tagging there, a street art crew from Germany. It’s the kind of place a fellow painter and art-lover like myself could have fallen back and gotten stuck in for a few more days or even weeks. The vibe was right, the sightseeing felt endless, and there was no shortage of inspiration. So if you find yourself in Santiago, Chile, get on a bus and head west for a couple of hours. A slice of colorful history awaits. So many colourful murals, I love it! Hi there,Thanks for a great post with amazing photos! I love how you combine a bit of history with the street art. It is so important also to learn about the background of the places we visit on our ways around the globe, and you do it so nicely! 🙂 Keep up the good work! This looks like such a cool place! Never would’ve known. Now it’s a stop on my bucket list, I’m gonna add it into a future Chile trip.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-trip-cost/,The Cost of Traveling in Patagonia (and How to Save),Chile,"Is it possible to visit Patagonia without breaking the bank? In a place full of both luxury hotels and plenty of camping spots, opportunities to hitchhike or take expensive scenic flights, and with paid tours or do-it-yourself options for the adventurous, it’s possible to do Patagonia on all kinds of budgets. I was more on the affordable but comfortable side of travel budgets in Patagonia, and spent a total of $3332 on approx. 60 days, coming out to ≈ $55.53 per day. Here’s how I did it and how you can do the same or even cheaper when traveling in Patagonia: Patagonia is split between Argentina and Chile, and neither country is particularly cheap. Chile has the best economy in South America. It’s stable, easy to travel through with pretty decent infrastructure, and as a result, nowhere near as cheap as the countries to the North of it in South America, like Bolivia and Peru. Argentina used to be a place where the black market meant tourists could get a lot more bang for their buck, but unfortunately due to recent changes, you’re not rich anymore in Argentina. I found it to be a pretty expensive country as far as food and accommodation, and especially gear. Neither country is a super budget destination (but neither is uber expensive, either), and the more remote places get, the more expensive they also tend to be. Keep this in mind when planning out your Patagonia budget. This is where you can really save or splurge in Patagonia, because some places, like Torres del Paine National Park in Chile, have super luxury hotel options as well as camping options. Here’s the usual cost: This is another area where you can really spend a lot or save considerably when traveling in Patagonia. There are three options for getting around and all have their perks: The food in most of Patagonia can get expensive in restaurants. Patagonia is also home to some of the best lamb and steak you can find worldwide, so it’s definitely worth splurging now and then on a meal out. The best way to combat restaurant prices is to buy your own food at the local grocery stores and cook it yourself in the hostel or campground’s kitchen. This is common practice in South America and most hostels have kitchens and cooking utensils available for guest use. When on the move, empanadas are a delicious and cheap way to fill your belly, as well as the menu del dia (menu of the day), which includes a starter, main, and dessert and are usually available around lunchtime. Gear can get expensive if you wait to buy it in Chile or Argentina. I balked at the prices of backpacks and sleeping bags when in Argentina, finding that some things were exponentially more expensive than they would be back in the States or in Europe. If possible, bring as much as you can from home. Here’s a packing list for clothing and a guide for camping and trekking to help you out.  In a pinch, head to the Zona Franca (duty free) shopping mall in Punta Arenas at the south of Chile if you’re traveling from South to North. Otherwise, prepare to pay similar or higher prices than you would at home. My Patagonia budget is based on a few flights, a lot of hitchhiking, a lot of private rooms, and a fair amount of camping when I was trekking, which was often. I also ate out regularly rather than cooking for myself, and rarely camped when in a town. I could have saved a lot more money by camping and cooking my own food, but decided to opt for more comforts instead. Traveling in Patagonia doesn’t have to be expensive. Regardless of your budget and comfort requirements, by sleeping in a tent and participating in free activities like enjoying nature, it doesn’t have to set you back too much money. Regardless of how you approach it, the best part of all is that the wine is delicious and cheap. Happy travels in one of the most beautiful parts of the world! Very interesting post! So much useful information! Patagonia is a fabulous country to visit! Just to be precise, Patagonia is not a country. It is a wide geographic zone covering the southest area of South América.The largest surface (West of the Andes) belonging to Argentina, and including the Perito Moreno glacier, while the eastern, narrowest área belongs to Chile. Hugo you need to check your compass Argentina is east of Chile. If you ate all that chocolate in one week, you may be my new hero… 8 days. Hell yes I did. Yes thank you so much for this post! I was wondering if I would ever manage squeezing a month-or-two-long Patagonia trip into my budget and was worried it might be super expensive, but it seems there are many ways to make it less than super expensive. Now I’m seriously considering when a Patagonia hiking trip is going to happen. If you’re willing to sleep in a tent then it can be pretty cheap 🙂 Thanks Kristin for a great article! You made us think about bringing camping gear as well ❤️ Thanks for sharing your knowledge with us! We found your article really useuful as we are taking a year from January 2017 and plan to spend at least 6months in South America ❤️Keep up the great work!Patrick and Cécile from http://www.travel4lifeblog.com Thanks for a great post! I was hoping South America would be cheaper, but sound like Argentina and Chile aren’t. Then again, we’re going to Alaska this summer, and accommodation is definitely going to be expensive there. We’ll be traveling to Patagonia with two kids, so not sure about backpacking. Sounds like for four people, a rental car might actually make sense. I wonder about an RV as an option. Any idea about that? I didn’t see many RVs but you can definitely find camper vans. I rented on with Wicked in the San Pedro de Atacama desert. It also depends on where you want to go. The Carretera Austral is mostly gravel so just be careful. My suggestion: Rent a small SUV ($100,00? a day). It could even be your home and you can store as much food as you need for the entire journey. Find a partner/s, split the bill. Being at the weathers mercy in Patagonia could be no fun even in summer. Distances are huge and you can always crash in your vehicle. You can stop and camp almost anywhere.  Follow the camping rules of no trace and please be very careful with open fires. Way too many forests went up in smoke in the past few years.In Bariloche,: go for Benroth Chocolates up the hill on Calle Beschted . Worth the walk! Or hitchhike! 🙂 Hi! I loved the article, i’m planning on doing a trip in a couple years. I noticed that soon you will be travelling to Uganda! I just returned after spending three months there! Within the city of Kampala is a place called Sanyu babies home where they take in babies left on the streets or in dire conditions and i think you’d love it! The home supports about 40 babies and anyone can go and volunteer their time here. You can show up and just sit and play with the babies, feed them, all sorts. If you talk with the ladies who run the home you can learn about some of the kids stories! It’s a wonderful place to visit if you get the chance, everyone is very welcoming and its a very positive environment Thanks Chloe, I’m never quite sure what to think about short-term volunteering with kids, but I’m glad you made me aware of it and that programs that care for orphans are in place! HI Kristin, I agree Patagonia is a great area for budget travel! We spent two months in Patagonia and spent less than $15 per day each. We did all the big hikes (and some small ones). Our secrets were camping, hitchhiking and cooking ourselves. I see you are currently in Tanzania, enjoy it is a great country! We are busy driving through Namibia. Safe Travels Definitely could have saved by cooking my own food and camping! Hi Kristin, Im thinking about going to patagonia next week. do you think it’ll be worth going and risking thing not being open due to winter? did you hear any info on this when you were there? Thanks, Steph Well it’ll be ‘open’ but a lot of the trails will be impassable or super dangerous. still beautiful! Kristin you are incredible! My boyfriend and I are reading your posts whenever we have time now, so much information to digest! So helpful!I went to Antarctica myself before without knowing a thing about Patagonia, only visited the national park in Ushuaia day before getting onto my cruise, felt like I missed out a lot.  Now I plan to go back to South America again to check it out!  Thanks so much for making this blog! Thanks for the kind words! Have a blast! Patagonia is so amazing. Awesome post! I spent two months in Patagonia this year. We found hitchhiking to be difficult when we were off of the main highway. Not only were there few cars, there were always about 10 backpackers on the side of the road waiting for rides. This was during March, so it was in the shoulder season. But, with the price of bus tickets in Argentina, it’s worth waiting for a while! I found the exact same to be true. I’d never had competition before when hitchhiking! Thank you for all the great info. I will be traveling this Novembe, solo,  for about three weeks. Noticed many did  this for at least two months, is three weeks enough in your opinion? Sure I have itinerary suggestions here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/patagonia-itinerary/ Hi Kristin, great information!I am thinking of taking my partner for his 50th next year, possibly 3 weeks, what month in your opinion is best?ThanksPauline February, March, early April 🙂 Great article Kristin. It is true that neither of Argentina or Chile is cheap!  “Argentina used to be a place where the black market meant tourists could get a lot more bang for their buck, but unfortunately due to recent changes, you’re not rich anymore in Argentina.” Sorry Argentina’s improving economy is such an inconvenience for you. I would like to think that if you are visiting a foreign country you would want its own citizen’s to be able to enjoy it as well. My local friends were complaining that the rising prices were really hard for them, so I’m not sure it’s an all-around good thing.  It’s not an inconvenience by the way, I’m just stating facts. No need to project your feelings onto my words 🙂 Great review thanks Kristin.  We’ll be in the El Chalten area in January and Torres del Paine in February next year.  Can you please give us some idea about food costs so we can work out our budget.  For example, how much is a beer, a steak meal and a meal of empanadas in each of those areas? Hi Julianne, a beer was around $3 for a Patagonia beer or a comparably nice one, wine was similar, empanadas are cheap too at $1.50 each or so. Steak and meat dishes can range anywhere from $15 to $50 depending on how nice the restaurant is. Hope that helps! Thank you, a very helpful and inspiring post! Hi Kristin! Your blog is awesome! I’m travelling to Patagonia next month and your tips, packing list and itineraries have been a huge help! One thing I’d like to ask your opinion on please –  I’ve been emailing a couple of tour companies to arrange a 5 – 10 day trek through Torres del Paine. Based on your experience, would you recommend waiting until I arrive in Puerto Natales (or Punta Arenas) to book a guided trek? Or are the prices the same as booking online beforehand?As a guide, I’m currently looking at $1600 USD for a 5 day W trek, which seems really expensive! Appreciate your feedback! Rita I don’t feel a guide is needed at all. Is there a reason why you want one? I’m travelling solo so I figured I’m better off with a group rather than trekking through Torres del Paine on my own. Do you think a guided trek is unnecessary? There are plenty of other people around but if you feel more comfortable with a guide then go with a group! Kristin, We are arriving in Patagonia mid-May. We plan to take a bus from El Calafate to El Chalten for a day trip as there doesn’t seem to be any hotels open in El Chalten in May. Do you think a car rental is best? We received pricing for tours and transportion – they do not seem like low season prices.  What do you think? I personally took a bus. The main things to do in El Chalten are reachable by foot. Hi Kristen, when trekking the O circuit, can I ask roughly how much your pack weighed at the start? Probably around 40 pounds    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-travel-easter-island-on-a-budget/,Easter Island Insider Tips: How to Plan Your Trip and Save Money,Chile,"Do you dream of traveling to Easter Island? Are you in search of that humbling feeling that overcomes you as you stand and marvel at the giant Moai statues, towering above us mere mortals? When I went there in April of this year, that’s most certainly what I was after. It really is as incredible as I always thought it would be to see the Moai in person. Though nobody knows the story entirely, since almost no original descendants of the Rapa Nui people are left, the story of the Moai is one of incredible human ingenuity and suffering and it’s a profound experience to walk among them and wonder about their stories.  Ready for a walk into the past? Here are the secrets for traveling to Easter Island cheaply and easily: On Easter Island, locally called Rapa Nui, the Moai statues represent a mostly-lost civilization that suffered from some sort of climate change or vermin, causing them to run out of resources. In an effort to appease their ancestors in hopes of returning to prosperity, they carved giant Moai out of volcanic rock and somehow carried them to the edges of the island, all without the benefit of knowing how to work metal. We still don’t know how they did it. The largest one around today is an astounding 33 feet tall weighing over 82 tons! In time as the situation grew more desperate, the people lost faith in these statues and battles ensued, including toppling over the Moai of rival groups. Most have been raised and put back in place but some are still laying facedown in the grass. You can still see the quarry where several statues are partially finished on the island. It almost looks like the Moai decided to have a party and some drunkenly stumbled down the mountain on their way to the sea. These days, the relics remain on an island where almost all of the original inhabitants have gone extinct, including the trees, animals, and original ethnic groups. It’s creepy and beautiful at the same time. Tours to Easter Island aren’t necessary, and will cost you way more in the long run. It’s almost impossible to get lost, and even if you did, the island is only 164 square kilometers so you can’t go too far astray! Here’s how to do it on your own: Flights: There’s only one plane from one airline that goes to and flies back from Rapa Nui daily and it’s operated by LAN departing out of Santiago, Chile. I suggest playing around with different dates on Google Flights then booking directly with LAN once you find a good deal. I booked my flight just two weeks before getting on the plane for $600, flying economy one way and business class back! Typically, a round-trip flight will cost $450 on the very low end and closer to $700 on the high end. Food: Your biggest cost-saver will be bringing your own food to Easter Island. Almost all of the food on the island will be brought over on the very plane you fly over on, so why pay a premium when you can just bring your food yourself for way less? LAN allows you to check up to 25 kilos per person for free when flying to Easter Island, so get an extra bag or box and fill it up with veggies, dry goods, powdered milk, oatmeal, potatoes, wine, and anything else to help you get through the week. By planning out my recipes ahead of time and shopping in Santiago I was able to eat for an average of $4.50 per meal, plus wine. When I did need to supplement my meals, I bought fish from the local fishermen for around $8 per person or bought empanadas at the small shops around town. *Note: You can only do this if you bring the food from within Chile. There are super strict laws in Chile around fruits and vegetables and anything you bring from home will not be allowed in, so be sure to do your shopping in Santiago. Accommodation: You can also save a bunch of money by staying in a cabana owned by a local on the island. They’re easy to find on booking.com (here’s the one I suggest) and Airbnb (plus, here’s $35 off for you!), can often accommodate six or seven people for around $50+ per night, and most importantly, they come with a kitchen so that you can cook all that food you brought along with you. It’s also common practice for the cabana owners to come and pick you up from the airport, which is always nice after a long flight. If you’re traveling solo, there are also hostels and individual rooms on Airbnb, and camping is also an option. Just keep in mind that the cheap stuff books out much farther in advance. Getting around: You really don’t need to take a tour to explore Easter Island. There are plenty of car, scooter, and quad rental places in Hanga Roa (the main town) that you can make use of to take yourself around to the various statues and the beach, on your own time, and in many cases, without other tourists around. Unlike those on bus tours, you’ll be able to spend as long as you want at the various sites. By normal standards, the rentals are pretty expensive at $40 per day for a motorbike and upwards for quad bikes and cars. That said, you can usually haggle on the car rentals and if you really maximize your time with the motorbike, you can see most of the things that are far away from town in a couple of days and rely on a cheaper push bike rental for the rest of your time there. Ask at the people working at the rental place that you end up choosing to show you where the sites are on a map. In lieu of that, check this one out. National Park Tickets: The fees for the national park are steep for foreigners at the equivalent of $60 USD, imposed by CONAF, Chile’s national park services (though there has been some conflict over whether they should have the right to do so, that’s the policy for now). You will only be checked by rangers at two of the sites: the Orongo crater at the Bird Man museum, which I could have lived without, and at the quarry. The quarry is probably the coolest site on the whole island, so as painful as it is, I’d suggest that you cough it up and buy the ticket. You can buy it when you land or at the CONAF office.  There are specific times when tours stop at each of the archaeological sites in order to get them with their best lighting. It’s still a good idea to visit them at those times as well, but also to stop by again during the off times and to stick around after the busses leave. They’re usually there for 10 minutes, max. Ahu Akivi These seven identical statues face sunset during the spring equinox, and their most popular visitation time is during golden hour. when the light shines on them. get there slightly before or stay after, and the busses will mostly be gone. Ahu Tongariki This is the biggest collection of Moai and also features the largest statue on the island. All were toppled over in the past but have been re-erected. During the summer solstice they face the sunset, but the most popular time to see them is for the sunrise since the sun rises between them. If you visit at any other time, almost nobody will be around. It’s popular to visit Rano Raraku, the quarry I keep referencing, right after visiting the Ahu Tongariki in the morning. It’s when they are in their best light. That said, I visited them in the afternoon and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere. This is one of two places where you’ll have to show a receipt for your national park fees, and you’re only allowed in once. Ranu Kau volcano and Orongo  This volcano crater is one of the most famous on the island and you can drive your motorbike right up to it. The best time to visit is when it’s sunny so that you can see the blue sky reflected in the pools of water at the base. It’s also possible to hike up to it from the CONAF station. There’s also the ruins of Orongo and the story of the bird man inside the museum, which also requires that you should your receipt for the national park fees. It’s an interesting story worth reading about. Ahu Tahai Located just next to Hanga Roa, these are the easiest to visit as you can just head over on foot if you’re staying in town. Though beautiful all day, they draw a crowd at sunset. There are plenty of other statues all along the perimeter of the island. some you can drive to and some you can only get to on foot. The above are the most famous, but you can visit the others, often without anyone around, as you drive along the island and pull off periodically to explore. What if you have a few days on Easter Island? I actually had a full eight days there, mostly because the flights got really expensive for any shorter length of time. I did a lot of relaxing, but otherwise, enjoyed the beach and diving as well: SCUBA Dive The reefs off of the island are nice, but not world-class like they are in Indonesia or Borneo. You can, however, get your selfie with this guy. It’s actually an old movie prop, which did make it less cool for me, but still an experience nonetheless. Surf Those who remember the documentary, 180° South, will recall that surfing is a big sport on Easter Island. If you want to give it a try, keep in mind that the coastline is mostly volcanic rock, and the waves break very close to them, so this isn’t ideal for beginners. You’ll also want to bring your own board as rentals are usually just the huge foam boards. Beach Easter Island’s beach is really nice, with white sand and gentle waves. It’s on the opposite side of the island from Hanga Roa, where most visitors stay, so you’ll need transport to get there somehow. If you’re on the island for a while, though, this is a great way to spend a whole day. Those are my best tips on how to travel to Easter island independently. It saves you money, gives you more freedom, and thankfully on Easter Island, it’s pretty easy. Happy travels! Thank you for writing this! It is perfect timing as I was just starting to plan my Easter Island leg of my trip through Chile. Very helpful stuff! Do you think it matters what part of the island you stay in? Are some spots better than others for reaching good photography spots during golden hours? Most of what you will find is in Hanga Roa. It’s where most people live and where most of the accommodation options are. That’s also a good sunset spot and you can walk to a lot of things from there, or bike. Having just gotten back from Easter Island, the only thing I personally disagree about is avoiding tours. Though of course not every individual place needs a tour, having one to talk about the history of each place and the theories made it so much more meaningful. Of course the Moai are cool on their own but learning about the society that built them is just as important to me. We were also lucky enough to be the only people at our guest house that day (low season) so we could stay at each place as long as we wanted and could even add extra places they don’t usually go to for no extra cost. So for saving money or even just people who enjoy exploring independently I think it would still be worth even doing a half day tour to get background that will make the places you do independently more meaningful. After all, if you travel all this way to see Moai it’s definitely worth knowing more about what you’re seeing! Oh also when we were there they were checking tickets at Ahu Akivi as well (though not as strictly as at the other two locations). I heard that this wasn’t really a practice before, but that checking tickets at other sites might become more common, so just something to be aware of! Wow really? Nobody was there when I went in April but regardless it’s just good to have a ticket in order to not miss out on anything I had a book that my guesthouse owner gave me about the Moai and brought it to each spot, so you can definitely still learn about them without needing someone to tell you (that’s how I was able to talk about the history in this post). However tours are also great so that you can ask questions. I just don’t like them! But this post is just a collection of suggestions based on the kind of travel that I like to do and for those interested in a tour, go for it! Hi girls! Thanks for a nice post!I totally agree with Anne, I am from Barcelona, and I have already been in the island 6 times, I felt in love with this place the first time I arrived on 2009 and almost every year I return to visit my family rapanui. So I totally agree Anne about to have a guided tour with local guides (always) they will explain you think that are not on books, and show you places that you can imagine that exist there and that only are known by them… if you decide to visit the island, is much more worthy to pay for a tour. but anyway lot of rapanuis can show you the island, it’s their culture, their ancestors and their home, I can confirm that you will know the island in other way.Iorana!Tomasa Looks pretty awesome.Seems like a steep price to experience, but it also seems like it’s completely worth it. Yeah it’s not cheap but it was a bucket list place for me Great tips. Thanks for sharing! Awesome post, very useful information! You’re super good at figuring out how to do cool affordable trips. I totally thought reaching Easter Island would cost a fortune, but you’ve piqued my interest and now I want to make it work when I take my future Chile trip! It was definitely cool to stop by and worth it once I figured out how to make it cheaper Hi Kristen,  Thank you for the thorough article.  I am most interested in the Cabana you mentioned in the article.I will be traveling with my family.  I am curious did you see any families in the local cabanas, or would I be better off in a hotel.  Did you experience any guest houses?  or am I over-thinking this? Is a guest house the same as a cabana?Thank you in advance for your helpJen. A Cabana is like an apartment or house rental. I think it’s important to have the kitchen so that’s why I’d avoid a hotel, assuming you want to save money. It was definitely low season when I was there so I didn’t see much of anyone else at all!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/coronavirus-cancel-trip/,Coronavirus: Should You Cancel Your Travel Plans?,China,"2/27 Update: Now that the virus has spread, one of the biggest considerations is quarantine when traveling to specific countries. This map can help you see the current situation, as well as the CDC website. Check with your airline and read up on any future travel destinations you have planned as well to see if any Asia travel now could prevent you from visiting in the future.  It’s in the news, it’s infiltrated our minds, and made its way into daily conversation. Many of us are wondering, how worried should I really be about Coronavirus?  Does its existence mean that I should cancel my trip abroad, especially to Asia? I found myself worrying about the same thing a couple of weeks ago. I even considered moving away from the person on the bike next to me in spin class due to her coughing. Who did she think she was, waltzing into class with what might be a deadly virus!? Then I had to reign it back a bit. Was I being crazy? How much of the worry I had about this virus was directly related to the alarmist headlines I was seeing in the news? I’m sure you’re wondering the same thing. How big of a problem is this and does it mean that you shouldn’t travel or try to plan any trips right now?  My aim with this post is not to provide answers, but rather straight facts and analysis based on them from which you can draw your own conclusions. I think that’s largely missing from the media circus around Coronavirus, and before anyone makes any rash decisions, it would be great to have a balanced, logical look at the numbers, right? So let’s dive in: I turned off the news on my phone a week and a half ago. I can’t even articulate how amazing this has been for my psyche. Did you know that alarmist headlines, which are increasingly the norm these days, affect our ability to imagine a more positive outcome? They directly impact the part of our brain that allows for creative thinking and problem-solving. Yikes. Human beings naturally fall prey to our negativity bias. Back in the hunter/gatherer days, being super cautious and assuming the worst was necessary for survival. Often, we are unconsciously acting on this primitive nature despite living in a modern world. Evolution just can’t keep up with how quickly things are modernizing, especially with how quickly information spreads now. I’m sure we’ve all felt the effects of fake news and watched as many elections around the world were thrown by alarmist headlines skewing people’s worldview. According to psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, people estimate the probability of an event by the ease with which such instances come to mind. If we are peppered with negative news, we tend to believe it all to be true. To me that means we need to be the selective bouncer to our minds and brains. What should be allowed in?  In a world where content is constantly competing for our attention, what is more likely to get a click? The media does a poor job of educating people, and an increasingly better job of grabbing our attention by any means necessary. It often glosses over reality and ignores the good things in the world that deserve equal attention. We’d do better to quit reading it altogether.  I’m certainly happier after doing so.  While this may seem like a digression from the point, Coronavirus is just one of a string of media circuses that have come out in the last decade. Do you remember Swine Flu? What about Avian Influenza or SARS? Let’s dive into the real numbers here and how the media reacted: SARS: Just over 8,000 people were infected resulting in 774 deaths. News outlets published articles that were, frankly, racist.  Avian Flu: Avian Flu (H5N1): The mortality rate was high, killing more than half of those infected, however the death toll as of January 2020 is only 455 people (3 deaths in the last 3 years) despite claims that it was the Monster at our Door.  Swine Flu (H1N1pdm09): An estimated 300,000 people died (range: 152,000-575,000) and 300,000 pigs were killed (by Egypt if that was the actual reason since there were no cases there yet at the time and would not have helped) before the virus receded, at which point companies in Europe had poured massive resources into developing vaccines that were no longer urgent (although it is part of the current flu shot). MERS: Mostly affecting those in Saudi Arabia, there are over 800 confirmed deaths as a result of MERS and 17,000 people were quarantined in Seoul after an outbreak that ultimately killed 37 people.  There are more epidemics like Ebola and Zika, many of which prompt racism and panic, but there’s one big thing that everyone tends to ignore about these pandemics. Allow me to pose a question: What I keep coming back to when I think about Coronavirus is how many people die of Influenza every year, and yet it rarely makes any headlines. According to the CDC website, an estimated 45 million people had the flu from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018. Of those, about 61,000 people died. That was in the US alone. At the time of this writing, about 37,600 people have been infected with Coronavirus resulting in nearly 815 deaths and over 2980 recoveries. Many of the deaths are in the elderly or the immunocompromised. Why is Coronavirus so much scarier than seasonal flu? Perhaps it’s a case of the devil we know versus the devil we don’t. Coronavirus is still misunderstood. It has spread faster than SARS, and since we can’t predict the future, we don’t yet know what the ultimate outcome will be. If history is any indication, given the rise in worldwide human population as well as growing bacterial resistance — cough cough, stop taking antibiotics for viruses and stop buying antibacterial hand soap — it’s only a matter of time until a major pandemic wipes out a significant chunk of the human population. Is it going to be the Coronavirus? We don’t know yet. I know that putting down alarmist news headlines while also reminding you that a big pandemic is unavoidable might seem contradictory but again, my only aim here is to provide facts rather than push you in one direction or the other. Now, what does that mean for your planned trip? As you consider canceling your trip due to the Coronavirus, it’s probably worth mentioning that you’re unlikely to get reimbursed by your travel insurance. There are very few travel insurance companies out there that cover pandemics, as well as civil unrest, and war – you know, just the exact things other than a personal tragedy that would make someone rethink a trip. Therefore if you make the personal decision to cancel your trip, the financial burden will likely fall on you. I’m certainly not advising that you make a decision about your personal health based on finances, in fact I’m not suggesting anything at all (just providing information to help you make an informed decision), but it’s interesting that almost nobody talks about whether they should travel or not during flu season, isn’t it? So is there anything that you can do to protect yourself, other than staying home? Of course, if you live in the US, staying home doesn’t mean absolute lack of exposure to Coronavirus with confirmed cases in several US states. The WHO recommends washing hands regularly as a much more effective method than face masks (which I think just make people feel good but do very little against inhaling airborne particles).  Of course, the decision on whether to travel or not during the outbreak is up to each individual person. I haven’t let an outbreak stop me from hopping on a plane yet, but that’s just one girl’s opinion, and that’s not what this article is about, anyway.  Have you canceled a trip or changed your plans due to the virus? Let us know in the comments! It’s good that you bring up humans’ tendency to negativity bias, and media’s love for hyping everything, especially things that scare people and create panic. During this time I’ve tried to avoid reading the news because the coronavirus is everywhere on media and it’s exaggerated all over the place. I’ve seen an interesting difference between Irish news (where I live) and Swedish (where I’m from) news or Italian.. On RTÉ the articles are so sound and fact-based, not written to awake people’s emotions I love that. I should only read Irish news from now on, at least when it comes to daily reading.  We always need to filter everything we read, see it with very critical eyes and try to stay updated with reliable and fact-based sources.  But of course, it’s scary. I paid a little extra with KLM to be able to cancel just in case. And I’m going to Sweden and back! I guess I’m just a bit negative. Interesting that the news in Ireland isn’t alarmist. I appreciate that too! It’s doing what it’s meant to and educating the public. There most certainly are alarmist Irish news sites, but the RTÈ is very simple and informational. I really appreciate that too! I live in Hong Kong and I’m not very concerned about the virus ( it seems a little bit more deadly than the flu). But the problem with travelling during an outbreak is that it could get pretty difficulty. Here in HK museums and tourist attractions are closed. In Vietnam, ha long bay cruises are cancelled and other activities may become unavailable too. For many reasons, this is not the best time to enjoy what some destinations have to offer to the fullest. That’s an important thing to consider. Thanks for bringing it up! Thanks for mentioning this. While I appreciate the blog post, this is what is really giving me pause. I’m all for going off the beaten path, but sometimes people visit tourist destinations in order to visit popular tour sites. If those are closed, you have reconsider your plans drastically.Are the Ventian museums going to refund the skip the line tickets that people had surely purchased?Might you get locked in your hotel like hundreds of tourists in Spain?How much difficulty might one encounter when they attempt to reenter their home country?Even if adventurous world travelers arent afraid of getting sick, you still have reckon with the fact that the rest of the world is. Yep, that’s the issue now, unfortunately. Great points you guys make. things changed a lot since I initially wrote this article! As a healthcare professional, a big thank you for this post!! The news in my country aren’t as alarmist as in the USA, but there’s still a lot of misinformation being spread online.So thank you for taking the time to educate yourself and present your readers with facts, it is much appreciated. So glad you enjoyed the post Martina 🙂 Flu death rate: 0.1%Corona death rate: about 3% Flu complication rate (needing hospital) 1%Corona complication rate: 20 – 25% Corona also spreads twice as easily. It is important not to panic (useless), it is important not to be alarmist. But this is not by any means ‘like the flu’. These are official numbers, but they don’t have enough test kits and China is trying to save face. They arrested the doctor who first raised the alarm on this – not a good look. So the infection rate is much higher – the death rate too. Even if you just take the official numbers, it has killed more people than SARS or MERS in a much shorter time span – it is much more infectious. Lower death rate does not matter if the numbers infected are much higher. Once infected it stays for 2-3 weeks. Of too many people are infected and hospitals are full up, the people that make up that really high hospitalisation rate are going to start dying. China has shut down it’s industrial heartlands, huge hit the economy. In Naning each family must select one person to go out for supplies twice a week. If someone is out without proper premission or without a mask they are arrested and taken to quantine camps. There are videos on the internet of this. China is dousing whole cities to disinfect the virus. Wuhan, Chengdu and many other cities are on lock down. There are videos coming out of China of overflowing hospitals. Crematoriums have run out of cars to transport all the dead bodies and have stopped offering funeral services, instead cremating 24/7. Whether to cancel your trip or not depends on where you are going, your age and health, many factors. But if you really think that China would hamstring it’s economy, extend the school break, extend the work break, nail people’s doors shut if they are suspected of being infected – only for them to find out the next day when they try to open the door – if you think they’d do all that for ‘ the flu’. I don’t really know what to say.Only that positivity bias exists too. Hmm, not sure where I said it was ‘like the flu’ You’re both right. 🙂  The coronavirus is clearly much deadlier and more dangerous – if you catch it. But that “if you catch it” part is the trick. Flu is so much more common, that it’s the bigger threat to you – at least for now. And I think that’s the point Kristin was trying to make in the article by comparing the two. You’re more likely to die from the flu than coronavirus at the moment, and thinking about how little you pay attention to the flu may help temper your panic if you have it. Keep updated about the infection rates wherever you want to travel (the “email alerts from the Foreign Office” mentioned in a post below sounds like a great idea), and then decide what risk you are willing to take, keeping in mind how you feel about the flu, and that may help you gain perspective. CFR for coronavirus is now tentatively 2-3% compared to flu at ~.1%. So the estimate is twenty times higher than flu. But that is not carved in stone. There is a lot they still do not know. There have only been 5 deaths outside of China. All of them are of Asian descent. Three were in their 80s. The man in Taiwan was 61. The man who died in Philippines, where I am, was 44 and he is reported to have had multiple other lung infections. They all had other health conditions that placed them at higher risk. That is out of 780 who have been determined to be infected outside of China. oh and…60,000 people will die of flu this month (globally) This is very well written! As someone who works in a Pharmacy and has been hearing from the CDC weekly through company emails this is spot on! Good job ar including all the necessary info and the facts!!! Thanks Kayla! I’m UK based, travelling to Asia via UAE on 20th February for 16 days.  When we first started hearing about the outbreak I signed up to email alerts for both regions direct from our Foreign Office.  Simple. – as informed as I need to be without all of the alarmist nonsense.   I had my flu jab several months ago because I live with elderly parents, one of whom is extremely vulnerable.  Will I cancel my holiday? Not blooming likely!  Will I take the precautions recommended by FO? Of course.  If in 26 days time on my return the advice from FO is different, I will adjust accordingly. That’s a good way to receive info! Thanks for this post! It’s refreshing to read something that’s not alarmist…US new is wearing me out! me too! Nicely written & refreshing perspective. Time for compassion over criticism and facts over fear (WHO). Be aware & be careful but also considerate of what many people (we are all the same in some ways) are going through x I love this article. People like the ‘big scare’ and want to sustain their anxiety, because it feels familiar and validates their negative experience of life. Thank you I thought I was alone in thinking this!  As for travel I plan on going to Malaysia (and yes I have read almost all of your Malaysian posts:) Keep on sharing your views – there’s people like me who find solace in knowing someone sees things differently!!!! <3 Glad you liked the post Kim! Have fun 🙂 I have a trip to Thailand with a stop over in Shanghai China both directions.  Little nervous,  but my daughter and I plan on still going at the end of March. Is it possible to re-route? The only thing about China specifically is many airlines have stopped flying those routes. Stay home! Thanks for the thoughtful post. It brought out good conversations. It brings perspective and rational thinking about the situation. Lots of fear and concern which is understandable, COVID-19 is spreading and can kill, but can’t let this fear and a lack of perspective keep people from traveling to places and feeling pretty safe or protected.Most important, beyond traveling or not, is that we can’t let the same fear, concern and even panic result in profiling anyone of Chinese descent (even those 2nd or 3rd generation in their home country) and bringing out longstanding prejudice.  Instead this should bring us together to contain this illness and help everyone stricken to recover fully. This issue of racism/prejudice is a big concern of mine (have friends who I worry about treatment by others) and am glad you brought it up, Kristin. We need to vigilant about that. You have all the bases covered here! The cases in Europe have been caused by people traveling to Italy.  Had they not travelled those people, and who know how many they have infected, would not have coronavirus.  We have to stop this spreading by immobilising people.  Pretty soon it will go and we can travel again.  Money can be earned again but you can’t get your life back. Respect your viewpoint and bring up a point that was hankering me for a while about how long this disease could be around. Thanks!Not sure a worldwide travel ban would work anymore or ever. Would it be just international or domestic now? Millions were traveling all over the place before it was realized this was a problem, not all people report, and some governments lie. Hindsight is 20/20.  Not sure this will simply go away. We still have the swine flu, SARS (very few cases, but not zero), etc. to this day. So the best thing to do for a possible long haul is to take precautions and be mindful of others. If this was just a one month or two month thing that would disappear I would agree with you, but what do you do if this becomes part of reality from now on? Stop traveling for years? And so many people were likely infected before all the quarantining started so are we just slowing the inevitable (don’t like this prospect, but CDC says 40-70% will likely be exposed eventually, even before Italy outbreak came out)? It didn’t start in Italy. Can say they weren’t careful enough (travel ban was slow in coming), but some of it was bad luck. Should the focus be more on making sure there are enough hospital beds, bulk up strong medical systems, develop medicines to relieve symptoms (eventually a vaccine), educating people on how to deal with it and get medical attention right away, protect the elderly and immune compromised the best we can (e.g., don’t visit them if have been exposed to ANY illness)? How about travel with caution instead of stopping altogether? Take the advice of the CDC/health departments of your country regarding avoiding certain areas?  When coming home from international trips to self-quarantine or keep a distance (I did that anyhow, when young always came back with stomach bugs)?  When I travel on a plane these days, even before this I would keep a distance from my family for several days since I have vulnerable family members. The biggest concern now for traveling it seems is not being able to come back home or being stuck in quarantine for a long time. I pray though that you are correct and I am totally wrong and that this illness does subside or proves to be less deadly or contagious (e.g., the numbers being reported are close to reality versus thousands of asymptotic carriers roaming around unnoticed – although having many getting no symptoms is a mixed blessing), but like you and others have said, prepare for the worst in a way (stock up on non-perishables for 2 weeks at home, stay home if not feeling well for any reason, have an emergency plan – should have had the latter already), but at the same time be calm, and in the meanwhile, continue to go on with your life as much as you can, but with this in mind, and the possibilities of quarantines; plus use common sense. If you are in the vulnerable categories, I would guess that you would exercise whatever additional precautions are required or recommended by your doctors or public health officials? If that includes restricting travel, then I guess I agree with your statement in that regard. While I make some recommendations, it is just my educated opinion really and I post many as questions for thought really as there are as many questions as answers. Hope I am not way off on this and sensitive to those affected. In the end I don’t think a worldwide travel ban is necessary.  However, it is up to each individual to do what is comfortable with him or her regarding travel decisions or anything else related to this and certainly life is more precious vs. money. Life is priceless and has to be enjoyed each minute.Do keep this is mind though regarding money/economy: If there is widespread panic and the world’s economies went into depression, it would certainly, I think, disrupt healthcare and lead to health issues and even more deaths (e.g, 10,000 suicides alone linked to Great Recession plus many deaths likely from losing healthcare), so everything is interconnected. So money can be earned again but unfortunately money is needed for healthcare (way too much in the US!), to keep the food on the table (including a two week supply of supplies, not cheap!), keep the electricity, gas, and water running etc. so we don’t want an overreaction.Last thing, I promise: Maybe when this does eventually wane instead of blaming travel we can look at ways to limit the original cause (animal to human transmission and mutation), invest more of our money in our public health institutes to find innovative ways to fight viruses/diseases beyond the cat and mouse vaccine game like the flu, invest more to improve the quality of healthcare (and quality of life) around the world (including heart disease and stroke prevention), increase cooperation, honesty and trust among humanity, and make people and countries feel comfortable about reporting such things without being stigmatized. Sorry if it is just a pipe dream!Thanks Collette for your thoughts and caring to respond to me. Sorry, I mean Colette! I have a trip to Bali and Singapore planned for mid-March. For now I am just keeping an eye on things. I’m not worried about getting the virus as much as getting into a quarantine situation. And here we are 02/22 booked and paid to travel to northern Italy in 4 weeks time. Yet as of today February 22nd Italy suddenly has the highest number of cases in Europe with 2 deaths. They’ve already put 12 towns in northern Italy into quarantine and suspended many events through out including the upcoming carnival. This is an area we were traveling to including other parts such as Venice and Tuscany and Rome. What will the coming weeks bring? Maybe that’s it it’s over and we can travel freely thru Italy. But of the last few weeks indeed days are any indication then our dream of a month in Italy may just stay just that…..a dream. I saw that too. I also was questioned at the border coming back in from Canada since I’ve been to Asia recently. It’s definitely becoming more of a thing though I’m not personally worried about getting ill, quarantine is definitely worth considering. If it doesn’t subside don’t go. Put yourself in the position that you or your family had contracted it, holiday wouldn’t be much fun and you would pay anything to stop it happening.  Just don’t go and put yourself in that position.  But then it is your money and your dream so your decision. We have a trip planned for the end of May visiting relatives in Bulgaria. Has anyone read information regarding the approximate time of the outbreak being over with? I’m travelling with my 3 kids and my elderly mother and I am very worried that we can be exposed to the virus while at airports and train stations. Do you all think that with the warming temps, the virus will stop spreading? Thanks Unfortunately that’s just for time to tell. We don’t know yet what things will look like in warmer temperatures or as it progresses. I live in Hong Kong too. My company has had a work from home policy since CNY in Jan as do most of our clients. I went to scuba dive in Indonesia over CNY no issues (wore mask on the plane and in the airport). Last week I went to ski in Japan for a week – immigration was lengthier and required more info than usual- but had a brilliant week. I returned to HK on Sunday just in time for my company to issue a policy update where Japan is added to the list of mandatory 14 day self -quarantine before returning to an office and physical interaction with any clients. I have no regrets about my trips – what I’m highlighting is currently depending on where you live and where you are going – this has impacts. My current biggest impact is I’m booked on Alex in wanderland’s Israel retreat at the end of May. Currently Israel is not allowing anyone in from a list of countries – of which being in HK the preceding 14 days is included. So I’m crossing all fingers and toes that Israel lifts this restriction before May so that I can still go on the trip 🙂 I’ve also cancelled my idea of going to China over Easter (luckily hadn’t paid any money yet). There are too many countries who won’t let you in after mainland travel, including hK who will put you in a government quarantine which could mean staying in a quarantine camp (doesn’t sound pleasant at all!) that is how my travel has been impacted by corona. I’m not thinking of India for Easter otherwise Bali That’s my biggest issue now – quarantine and being barred from going on future trips because of where I’ve already been. I am also hoping that these travel bans lift soon because THAT’s the main issue for me now. Whilst I agree with what you have written, it doesn’t hurt to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. As you mentioned, the elderly and immune compromised will be at greater risk. There are many many of these people on this planet of ours and I doubt they are going t take any of this lightly. I’m not suggesting anyone take it lightly!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/huanglong-national-park-china/,"The Hidden Huanglong National Park, China",China,"Look up any list of unbelievable places you never knew existed and you’ll be surprised just how many of these insta-worthy places can actually be found in China! On our trip, we were fortunate enough to be offered a job teaching English and it’s been one of our most amazing experiences to date. One of the best things about integrating as a local is that your travel experience can be enriched through local knowledge and sites off the beaten path. Acting on this knowledge and utilizing this closely guarded travel tip has led us to some pretty unimaginable locations we would only dare to dream of previously before we ventured far and wide into the World. Coinciding with taking some time off from our teaching roles in May, the location this time would take us all the way to the Sichuan Province in the North East, tiptoeing across the Tibetan border. Flying into Jiuzhaigou airport, the third highest airport in China, we were immediately greeted by the mountains that smothered the landscape of the Sichuan Province. The deep valleys and birds eye mountain views only preparing us for what was to come in this rural and rugged land. Neighboring Tibet, Jiuzhaigou is instantly recognizable by its vast array of multicolored prayer flags that have been strewn across the hillsides, each colour representing a different element and each baring individual thought and devotion.  Jiuzhaigou is also known throughout the World for its national park, a popular tourist spot amongst Chinese travellers due to its beauty, crystal clear lakes and its barrage of forest. It is in fact its neighbor, Huanglong National Park that is the hidden gem of the province and largely overshadowed by its big brother. A mere 40 minutes drive away from the touristic town of Jiuzhaigou, many of whom stay in the town where the National Park is only a few minutes walk away Huanglong is often disappointingly dismissed by travellers. We were surprised how many locals attempted to discourage us from making the journey to Huanglong in order to keep the tourism within the local town; however, the park is definitely not to be missed.  Although its not as easily accessible as the Jiuzhaigou National Park, getting to Huanglong is relatively straightforward and inexpensive. There are regular buses that make the trip from Jiuzhaigou town everyday departing around 9am and returning for 4pm. These buses are very cheap, however, the mountainous terrain doubles the journey time, meaning that you only have a few hours to explore. We opted to take a private taxi that was arranged for us by our guest house. It cost us around 400RMB to hire the driver for the day, but it was worth every penny. He collected us at 8am sharp and we didn’t set back to Jiuzhaigou until 5pm. As we wound our way through the mountains, our driver stopped frequently to allow us to marvel at the surroundings and of course, pose for some obligatory pictures!! We were amazed at the prayer flags that had been set by the locals, the different colors brightening the landscape and acting as a reminder that we were venturing along the Tibetan border.  We arrived at the park after 9am and paid just 210RMB for the pleasure of entering the grounds. Unlike the Jiuzhaigou National Park that sees thousands of visitors each day, ourselves and another family were the only visitors. Wooden decking maps out the walkways to the different sections of the natural pools. Although getting around is not strenuous and those looking for a breather will undoubtedly be spoilt for opportunities to catch a breath while admiring each cascading pool, there is also a cable car that transports visitors for 80RMB.  We headed through the gates where we were greeted by the 5km stretch of ice cold limestone pools that stretched as far as the eye could see. We had never seen anything like it. At 3500m above sea level, each pool had been uniquely formed from the rainwater flow from the mountains above, which acted as the perfect backdrop, and complimented the landscape to a tee. One of the most surreal places we have visited, it’s with no doubt that this well kept secret is worthy of a “Wonder Of The World” title. Laying our eyes on landscapes such as that of Huanglong National Park confirms to us why we love to travel. The unimaginable natural beauty, the serenity of the atmosphere and the bluer than blue icy pools have helped us to create memories that will last a lifetime. One thing that we have learnt from our travels around China is to expect the unexpected. The world is a beautiful place and sometimes the most beautiful places are those that are kept the most secret of all. From karst landscapes, dazzling skylines and unusual landforms, China has some amazing places that we never knew existed.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/where-to-hike-in-hong-kong/,Where to Hike in Hong Kong,China," Hong Kong is one of the most famed cities in the world for its skyline, culture, and food. The island drapes the banks of the South China Sea which flows freely between Hong Kong island and Kowloon with the bright lights of the city serenading tourists as they take in the panoramic cityscape for as wide as the eye can see. It will come as no surprise that the urban landscape is popular during every season of the year. Sensational shopping, a stylish restaurant and bar scene and some of Asia’s best hiking routes cultivates in a perfect blend of East meets West.  Yes, you heard us correctly! For all you hiking junkies looking for a surprising yet compelling fix, Hong Kong and the surrounding islands are the perfect location to offer up your next hit. We were particularly attracted to Lantau Island having heard from our Chinese teaching colleagues that it houses the famous Big Buddha statue and is a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. We were told to check out the Lantau Peak Trail in particular (the second highest peak in Hong Kong) and after only 1 hour of trekking, we were greeted by this sign to the right hand side of the track and our curiosity lead us to take a major deviation off the beaten path. We were later informed that this trail is unofficially titled ‘The Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail” due to its pointed peaks and valleys.  Aptly named, this trail takes you on a twisty, jagged journey on the tight crags lining the precipice of one of the tightly formed mountains. But be warned, this crossing is not for the faint hearted and coming from two adventure seeking souls who have previously taken on the Worlds deadliest trail in China, this must be saying something! We don’t know how we get ourselves into these situations, honestly! For those hikers that like their trails rigorous, rough and relentless and all for the love of the accomplishment from completing the expedition, then this ones for you. The first 500m see’s you scrambling over rocks and boulders, so it is advisable to bring a pair of gloves, if only we knew beforehand! As you pass along the ridge, the views to behind of Shek Pit reservoir are ones to be savoured. The lush green valley below deepens the higher you climb and the narrow crags of the rock face make for dazzling views along either side of the mountainside, making for one of the most overwhelming hiking sensations we’ve ever experienced.  As you scale the ridge further, Lantau’s prize asset will come into view. While most tourists have jumped off their tour bus crammed into the viewpoint square to admire the 34m high Tian Tan Buddha statue, on the trail you are all but a solitary figure peering over the valley, taking in the panorama from above. It really is something to be able to view such a highly populated attraction from the serenity of the mountainside.  As you venture steeper, you will pass one of the trails most difficult endeavors, ‘A Slim Chance Of Survival’, again rather suitably named! This section can be recognized as the trodden path turns into a cliff face with two paths meeting either side. Push through this part of the trail and you will be rewarded with a less strenuous 60 degree climb before rejoining the Lantau Trail at ‘Tsim Chai Au’, standing some 810m high. At this point, you can either turn right and scale Lantau Peak ascending a further 120m, or choose to descend to the left to where you will reach Ngong Ping, the Big Buddha viewpoint and the cable cars to Tung Chung.  Having completed the trail, we were still looking to add to the day’s adventures. Walking past the tourists that swarmed the Big Buddha, we headed for the main road. Still way above sea level, we marveled at the waves as they lapped at the shore in the distance. We continued down the winding roads towards our next stop, Tai O. A tiny fishing village located on the west side of the island, Tai O remains untouched by the western world, providing an insight into authentic Hong Kong. The quaint village is one of the last traditional Chinese fishing villages in Hong Kong and it stands proudly on stilts above the South China Sea. Throughout the day, you’ll notice the tide drifting in and out beneath the seemingly make shift homes.  As you stroll through the streets, you’ll first be met by the pungent smell of fish as it hangs to dry outside of the shops, it’s also renowned for its shrimp paste, although we weren’t brave enough to try it for ourselves  Many of the locals offer boat rides from the harbor for around 20HKD, allowing you to witness an active fishing port as well as admiring the picturesque village from the water. If you’re lucky, you may also catch a glimpse of one of the rare pink dolphins that reside in Tai O’s waters, although we must admit, we were pretty unfortunate! If you fancy being a little more active, you can also rent a kayak and paddle through the blue waters. How To Get To Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail From Hong Kong take the MTR to Tung Chung Station. Take bus number 11 or 23 and get off at Shek Pik police station next to the reservoir. Walk back the way you have just come for 500m until you see the country park. Go through the metal barrier and follow the path until you cross the bridge about 150m after the gates. Head up the steps and you’re on the Lantau Peak Trail. Continue walking for an hour and after 3.5km (the distance covered is signposted) you’ll come to the Shek Pik reservoir viewpoint. On your right you will see a red sign telling walkers that there is no entry, this is in fact your starting point and the gateway to Dogs Tooth Ridge Trail.  At the end of the trail if you wish to visit Tai O village, you can walk, although this does take a while (and we stupidly made this mistake so you don’t have to), or you can get the bus from outside the Big Buddha statue that will take you straight there! Lantau Island offers a much needed breather from the luminous delights of the urban landscape and who would of thought that a hiking haven exists outside of the concrete jungle! While the trek is difficult and strenuous at times, the sight and surroundings are unrivalled to any other trail in the area and offers a seriously adrenaline fuelled expedition for those looking for an alternative adventurous trail.

Its surprising but Hong Kong is really great for hiking and they have some great spots that you can trek with views over the city too! The picture with the fog is one of our favourites too 🙂 xx It’s this and Victoria Peak that are really my favorites! The former, I think, is a lot ‘greener’, just due to the fact that it’s covered by trees, and though it’s definitely easier, it’s kinda in the heart of HK. Then there are a crap ton of mountains, even when you get into the less-compact-residential areas, many of which are open to hiking! Hiking HK is definitely worth it. I really want to go there in Hong Kong to see these beautiful places and try their different culinary excellence. I am a food lover and I am sure I will enjoy the food in Hong Kong.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-hike-yangshuo/,How to Find The Hidden Views Of Yangshuo,China," On your right hand side, you’ll see the start of the path. You’ve made it! That is an amazing view! I love how detailed you are in how to get there- super helpful! Also, the fact that the hike is not that long makes it even better 😛 Hey Brianna! The view really was one to savour and gave such a different perspective of the town from up there. If you follow our directions it really is as easy as it sounds! And yes, always a plus to know the hike isn’t actually torture! Even more reason to go see! How did you even find this little hike to begin with?? That’s awesome you have such detailed directions, cause that looks like a view I would love to see if I make my way to China one day! Hey ljana,  As usual we couldn’t resist wandering a but further than the tourist trail and we found ourselves in the residential streets of Yangshuo and found the start of the trail. We are so glad we persevered and found such an amazing view! You should definitely check it out if you visit. The view is particularly stunning as the sun sets. Wow! This is a great finding. I love that view!! Really was worth getting away from the main streets which is what lead us to the start of the path. The view was the result of a major case of curiosity! What an amazing view! Thanks for mapping it out, maybe we’ll get there someday. 😉 Thank you so much for sharing the hiking route with us. We were following your directions today and made it to the top with a spectacular view!! We would never have found the entrance to the trail without your detailed description.  Best,Laura Yay!! Lol thanks for the info. Just did the hike today. Amazing views. Wahoo! Thanks for this idiotproof guide. Tried and tested yesterday! sweet!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-books-for-traveling-in-asia/,The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia,China,"Reading is where I get the majority of my enjoyment these days. Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships. This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads. This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:    First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers by Loung Ung This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today.  It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading. It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.  Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute by Bua Boonmee First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is incredibly eye-opening. I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the Thai sex industry have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.  Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam by Andrew X. Pham This book was a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me. I personally really loved visiting Vietnam. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.  Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal by Conor Grennan Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal. Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family. Sold by Patricia McCormick Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world  in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change. (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)  What Makes You Not a Buddhist by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse The title of this book really is misleading.  It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger. I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a 10-day silent meditation in Thailand. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding. This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.  I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone! A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack. It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn. — I read all of my books on a Kindle because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books. Given I’m usually reading 2-3 at a time, I need them in electronic format. Plus, I can keep highlights and clippings of the books for later reference – which I do make use of. I am always looking to add to this list, so if you know of a great read, let me know! Lastly, these are affiliate links, which means if you make a purchase via the link, I get a very small percentage of the sale price. It’s not much but it does help me maintain this website. Now that I think about it, if you have someone special in your life that is traveling soon, one of the best gifts would be these books loaded on a Kindle. Just a thought! Happy travels.   I love this because I always try to read a book about the place I’m traveling to/in. I also appreciate that you highlighted books written by people who actually live or are from those countries. I think both  perspectives (insider vs outsider) are good, but I always tend to lean to the home country authors. Last, I read Catfish and Mandala about 10 years ago and I still remember how good it was! Which is at lot considering I often can’t remember books I read last year:) I like the first-hand narrative style of people from the countries as well. Sometimes it’s an outsider who wrote it as in the cases with the Nepal books, but the others gave me a better insight, I felt. Hi,I was going through the comments, and saw your reply asking for the affiliate link of the book Nothing to Envy. I will take this opportunity to send the link to youHere’s the link:Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea I loved your website and articles. You are doing a great job! Thanks and thanks! “The Red Market” by Scott Carney.By no means is this an uplifting book either but it does show you a dark world hidden within some countries like India, Philippines, & China.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061936463 It’s important to understand all aspects, I think. Not just the good parts. Thanks for the recommendation! Ah, amazing! I was just thinking one of my aims for my trip next year should be to read at least one book about each country I visit. This is a great selection to get me started. Wish I had some recommendations for you, I plan to have many by the end of my trip! Great then I look forward to your eventual recommendations! I know a must-read for Myanmar- From the Land of Green Ghosts http://www.amazon.com/From-Land-Green-Ghosts-Burmese/dp/0060505230 Awesome, thank you! Thank you, Kristin for your great list of book. Next week I will go to Myanmar and I was glad find book about this country in comment to this post. Now I read “From the Land of Green Ghosts” and expect very interesting travel. I just love the commenters on this blog! They’re so helpful. Anything on China? I’m heading there in a few days. I’ve been reading China in Ten Words by Yu Hua, which has been a fairly easy read and talks about the author’s upbringing during the Cultural Revolution, among other things. I’m definitely going to check out What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Thanks! I’ve read a lot of textbooks about China, especially modern Chinese politics (it was an area of study for me at University) but not as many memoirs. A good friend of mine loves My Several Worlds by Pearl S. Buck. There’s a novel called To Live by Yu Hua that you might find very interesting. It’s about a formerly rich family’s struggle as Mao rises to power. There actually are a lot of memoirs about China, too many of them. The most popular ones are Peter Hessler’s books, works by Xinran, Wild Swans, Wild Grass, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. I personally recommend Ancestral Leaves by Joseph W. Esherick, which chronicles his wife’s family through most of Modern Chinese history. As a historian, he knows his facts. Many of them focus on the turbulence of the Mao Era or the strains on society caused by the neck-breaking  pace of development. Pearl S. Buck, writes from the Republican era. Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a good place to start for contemporary Chinese literature. He works tend to be a bit political and focus on Chinese society. Soul Mountain, also by a Chinese Nobel laureate for literature, Gao Xingjian, is in contrast a much more personal journey and doesn’t touch much on the social upheavals of the era. The Republican era was a golden era for Chinese arts and literature. Writers from that era, such as Lu Xun, Xiao Hong, Ba jin, Qian Zhongshu, and Lao Shu, are still deeply revered in modern Chinese society. Thanks so much for the suggestions, Paul! It’s clear to me now that I should have been reading a lot more books on China all along. It’s the country that fascinates me the most. Will definitely add some of these to my list of books to read and hopefully grow this post to include some of these. Oh, totally love this post. I’m always looking for books or movies that have the places I want to see in them. Great idea. 🙂 I absolutely adore The Lover for Vietnam. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Adapted from a book as well which I suppose I should have included here as I’ve read that one too but forgot about it until now! I’ve just started ‘Anil’s Ghost’ by Michael Ondaatje which touches on Sri Lanka during their civil war. So far I really love it – perhaps I am slightly biases since I was there in September and have a huge love for the country, but I would say it’s worth reading! I do as well since I was there about a year ago. Thanks for letting me know because I’d love to learn more about that beautiful island. Great list Kristen! I haven’t read Miss Bangkok, Sold, or What Makes You Not  Buddhist, but the others are great and really do have a lasting imrpession, especially when you read them in the country they’re set in. 🙂Reading books about different countries and their history, and other travellers’ account of their adventures is one of my favourite parts of travel!! You’ve read all the others? Nice! I guess great minds think alike. Out of those I’d recommend What Makes You Not Buddhist next, but that is my favorite book so I’m biased 🙂 For fiction, the Bangkok 8 series is interesting and entertaining. Certainly not an accurate representation of Thailand in general, but the author does highlight several finer points of Thai Buddhist practices and cultures that are fascinating and interesting to read about if you’ve spent some time there. I really enjoy books about Buddhism so I might like that one a lot. Ahhh thank you for the reminder that I have been meaning to read “First They Killed My Father” for three years now since first visiting Cambodia! Added it to the list. Great, great read. I just read a great book set in India, by Kiran Desai, called Hullabaloo In The Guava Orchard. A really easy, funny read, with engaging characters and great descriptive prose. Of course for fiction, there’s always Memoirs Of A Geisha, too, which I LOVE. One I really recommend is called Nothing To Envy, by Barbara Demick. There are accounts of six defectors who escaped North Korea during the massive famine that killed millions in the 90’s. Such a good book about a country that we don’t know that much about. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha as well! I read it in high school.  THANK YOU for the Nothing to Envy suggestion. I think I’ll read that next because N. Korea really fascinates me. If you have an affiliate link with amazon send it over 🙂 What a great list of books. Thanks! I think I’d start with the What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Its a great one to start with One of my absolute favorite books has always been Shantaram. I recommend it to everyone! Its a beautiful autobiography (some ppl do challenge this) of a convict from Australia who escaped prison and ran off to India. He really writes beautifully about living in the country and his adventures there.  And then of course if you want a lighter take on India, there’s always Holy Cow that helps balance off the two experiences =) I did read Shantaram and while I felt the guy was a good writer I just couldn’t get past his god complex. It bothered me. It did help me get a better feel for India (I guess?) but I didn’t love it enough for it to make the list. It was a compelling read, though. I give it a 6 out of 10. There are some great books here! Some of my favourites are A Fine Balance (India), Wild Swans (China), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan) and Ghostwritten (set in many locations, but the Mongolia story is my favourite). Maybe I should write my own post! Thanks for the recommendations! Looks like I need to do some China reading. Thanks for this list! I’m living in bangkok at the moment and really wanted some reading inspiration! What makes you not a Buddhist is honestly one of the most amazing books I’ve read, I’m going to spread the word it’s very rare to find something so grounded in fact and truth yet so magical at the same time. Keep doing what you’re doing – I love your blog! Xx Yay! I’m glad you liked the book! It really did change my life for the better. Oh, this brings back memories. I always used to try to read a book set in another country before I got there/while I was travelling around. I’m not quite sure when I got out of the habit. I’d like to do it again, though. Thanks for the inspiration! Always such a nice way to understand and appreciate a country’s history 🙂 I love to read about places that I’ve been too. I read a LOT of China books because it helps me grasp the country a bit more. You should check out Peter Hessler’s books – he’s an awesome writer. I’m really curious about the Buddhism book, it would be nice to learn a bit more. Awesome thank you. I think you’re the second to comment recommending Holy Cow so I’ll look that one up. The other sounds incredible as well. Thanks for the great list, I am excited to check these out. I always try to read books when traveling in a country – I feel like it gives so much great context and cultural understanding that you don’t always get just by interacting with locals. Here are a few that I found useful – for Cambodia – Report from the Stricken Land; for China – easily the best travel companion is China Road by Rob Gifford (also available as an excellent audio book); and for India – Inspite of the Gods – the rise of Modern India. All of these were written by journalists who covered these countries for decades and have plenty of anecdotes, historical knowledge and well rounded understanding of a range of subjects pertinent to these countries. Those are great suggestions! A lot on this list are written by locals but it would be great to get a journalist’s perspective as well. Thank you for the incredible list its helpful.. Great suggestions! I loved Catfish and Mandala! Although its not as deep and insightful… No touch monkey was a great lighthearted traveler’s book for southeast asia (and other parts of the world)… definitely recommend for a light read 🙂 Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely agree with the title at least! Thanks for the recommendation for: What Makes You Not a BuddhistGreat description and awesome read. Just finished the book this avo! Awesome I’m so glad you liked it! I was excited to see that a lot of people ordered that one. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone read it 🙂 I read “When Broken Glass Floats” while in Phnom Penh which is a similar memoir to First They Killed My Father. I had planned to read them both, but after the first one, I didn’t think I could handle reading about that tragic history again. The book reduced me to tears more than a few times, and like you say, made me appreciate the smiles and hospitality around the country so much more. The other books you’ve listed look great as well, Miss Bangkok looks powerful, and Bkk is one of my favourite cities ever – might have to read that one on my next plane ride there. Thanks! I cried too reading First They Killed My Father. I agree it might be tough to read two such memoirs back to back. I started reading one about a child soldier in Sierra Leone and wondered to myself why I read such tough books but then realized, it helps you appreciate the current situation much more and the need for love in this world more than ever. Hi Kristin, Did you use a travel guide in south east Asia? Awesome website by the way, inspiring and useful! X iris Nope. I never do. I get my ideas by talking to locals. Orwell’s first novel, Burmese Days, paints Colonial Burma in a satirical light and offers decent insight into old traditions such as chewing betel. It’s worth reading just to see Orwell’s nearly century old take on present day Myanmar as well as his stunning insights into the bureaucratic nonsense that came along with it. Thank you for the recommendation! Hi there, I really enjoyed reading your past updates and most recent post 🙂 I was recommended your blog by transient20s. I have just started on WordPress since I am just beginning my travels – not only to keep my own recording of the journey, but also to read other people’s recommendations and insights. Some of the stuff I have read so far is great and I would love if you had any other recommended bloggers etc for me to follow? I am 23 and my first post lists the places I will be visiting. Thank you! Rebecca x How kind of them to recommend me. Yes for sure! These are my faves: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-blogs/ I’ve always considered “The Beach” a must read for anyone visiting Asia, but I love your list. Will definitely try to read at least one of those books this year! I haven’t actually read it but based on the movie, can definitely see why. I was trying to think of things that are less based on fiction and more based on the culture of the countries, but should read that one as well. If you are travelling India I absolutely recommend “The God of Small Things” for some beautiful magic realism and accurate “images” of local kids. And of course I have to recommend the famous “the white tiger” also full of indian typical images and very very entertaining reading. Both Indian writers Would love to read them regardless! I love having a peek into a culture I’m not yet familiar with Yep, Catfish and Mandala is a good one. I read it long before I ever wen to SE Asia, but remember it as a compelling read. So compelling and well-written. I love reading people who are such great writers as they encourage me to improve. I loved Little Princes! I recently did a Buddhist temple stay here in Korea and loved my time there. I’ll definitely have to check out “What makes you not a Buddhist” as I really want to learn more about the religion.Thanks for the recommendation!Some of my favourites are Escape from camp 14, a book about one of the few people to have escaped from North Korea’s prisoner camps. A shocking but interesting read (although it came out recently that he had lied about a few things in the book)Into Thin Air is also a great read! I am so fascinated by North Korea so I’m definitely going to give that a read. Thank you for the suggestion! Are there book about Malaysia and How long can I use these book? I haven’t read one about Malaysia yet but when I do I’m happy to post about it! These are mostly memoirs and relevant any time. Thanks for the awesome list! I am definitely going to check them out, especially the one about Buddhism. When I’m in Thailand later this year I am going to check out a meditation retreat in a temple, so I should probably learn more about Buddhism first. 😛 That’s a really good idea and I was very glad I’d read that book prior to going simply to have the basics down when the monks referenced the Truths.  Is it this one you’re going to? Was a very profound experience for me: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/monastery-thailand/I have some tips to help you prep here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/suan-mokkh/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chillest-places-asia/,The 8 Chillest Places in Asia,China,"When you imagine the most peaceful place you’ve ever been, what comes to mind? I’ve been to places where, whether it’s because of a hippie vibe, a genuine feeling of peace, or just the amazing people around me (usually all three), it just feels chill, and I feel like I could stay there forever. I came to realize over time that these are the places I like the most. They’re usually small communities, very focused on the preservation and appreciation of nature, and the general feeling is one of calm. Here are the best of what I’ve discovered so far: Even the name, Ella, sounds all magical and beautiful. In Ella, plenty of bars and restaurants have lounge lofts with bean bags, coffee stops, and your typical corner roti man serving up meals for under a dollar. The train ride to or from this beautiful town is breathtaking as well (get the spot in the doorway!). Ella itself is full of waterfalls, wonderful hiking, and is bordered by tea plantations on both sides. I’ve said it before and will say it again: it’s some sort of unspoken rule that anywhere with tea plantations will and must be beautiful. Yubeng is located in the far west of China, right up against Tibet in Yunnan province. It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a sacred area and all along the trail to Yubeng prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it. I talk about Pai all the time. In life, in this blog, in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day. I could visit the Land Split, swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon. The thought has often crossed my mind to take up a longer term residence there at some point. Speaking of hippie paradises, Otres Beach in Cambodia might be the winner, at least when I was there a little over two years ago. Most visitors who spend a while there have the same routine: wake up, swim, have some muesli and green tea, buy a mixed bag of small and sweet banana, mango and pineapple from the fruit lady, have a few Anchor beers, swim, consider BBQ or a bonfire, rinse, repeat. Why not? It’s paradise incarnate with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water. Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared. It’s easy to laze away in Don Det, reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world. I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali. Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street. Dali is relaxed, it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it. Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous. Discovered by accident when I was entranced by the look of Tonsai on my way to Railay (I asked the boat man to take me back to Tonsai once I’d seen it, please and thank you), I’ve returned and just love the chill vibe and beautiful surroundings. Tonsai is also an active place, full of kayakers, divers, rock climbers, fire dancers ,and slack-line walkers. It’s the perfect place to pick up a new skill, or to just laze around by the beach and read books. This was my favorite part of Vietnam because the locals flashed peace signs at me as I rode by on my motorbike, families watched fascinated and waved from their porches, and and old lady sat on my bike with me, stroked my face, and then rested for a while as we just sat there in relaxed silence. It was all quite strange and amazing. There’s really only one road through the town and not a whole lot of noise or business around. This makes for a really peaceful, agricultural, and naturally beautiful place. I definitely felt calm and in my natural element while at Phong Nha. — Those are my personal favorites, but there are an infinite number of chill places to find, no doubt, and what is chill is usually a bit undiscovered, so the chillness level does change often. Regardless, when I look back on my travels, these are the places I tended to enjoy the most and to find the most like-minded people. Coincidentally they are all naturally beautiful. What would you add to the list? I’m always on the hunt for the next peaceful, quiet, mellow destination.   Hi Kristin,First thanks for the list: after 7 years, I will be back in Southeast Asia in a few days for 4 months, and 2 of the places you list are actually on my list (never been there before): Phong Nha Ke Bang & Otres Beach. I was actually scared Otres Beach would be awfully touristy!In a completely different way, the last place I found really relaxing and inviting to slow down in Asia was Turtuk, in the Nubra Valley in Ladakh.CheersGilles It’s possible it has become more touristy since I was last there – in fact I’m sure it is. If you really want something more remote you can head to Rabbit island off of Kep in Cambodia. They didn’t actually have running water or even electricity when I was last there, so I’m guessing things may have upgraded slightly since then. Would love to hear your thoughts after you go to Otres! Thanks Kristin!I will let you know and of course write about it.I am concerned about the masses especially since I will be there over Xmas.CheersGilles Please add the name of each country. The name of each country is listed right next to the name of the city. Ella is in Sri Lanka, Pai is in Thailand, etc. Hoi An is very pretty. I’ve heard great things about Khao Sok! Otres Beach was definitely a highlight of my Asia trip. I met some awesome people there and we enjoyed low key days on the beautiful beach and then BBQ and (50 cent) beers after the sun set. Perfect. I also really liked Don Det and Pai so it seems like we have similar tastes. I’ll have to check out the rest the next time I’m in Asia. I think the beach BBQ I had on Otres was the best I’ve ever had. The meat was so good and we ate it all with our hands. I just love eating with my hands, to be perfectly honest. I would also add Chitwan in Nepal and also Battambang in Cambodia. Unbelievable laid back and peaceful for a small city! Thanks! I should check those out as I haven’t been to either one. “It just feels chill” – Ok, you couldn’t have said it better. Great suggestions and i love the photos (hanging out in Pai is my favourite). Haha, it’s a feeling, you know? Awesome! If you hit any of these I think you’ll be pleased with the vibes. These place are all really nice, but if you reaaaally want to chill out I’d say head to Central Asia! Like Khorog in Tajikistan, or Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. So laid back! So many people have suggested that lately and I’ve heard great things. They’re on the list now. Aahhh I am ALL about the chill places! Def adding these to my list for my RTW next year. Thank you! 🙂 Nothing better than a great chill place! It’s now my mission to visit as many of these places as I can on my trip to Asia next year. Thanks for sharing them! That’s awesome! Let me know how it goes please! Dali is the only place I really want to visit in China…met a couple who owns a hotel there and it just sounds magical There are so many other amazing places in China worth visiting as well, especially around Dali. Let me know if you ever make it out there! Khao Sok in Thailand was incredible.. I had to return a few months later! I will go back as well. I agree with Don det, so relaxed. Great post, gives me some ideas for the future Thanks for letting me know about Khao Sok. I want to check it out! Hi you should try Easter island its Amazing i sat at the higest point on the island, then it hit me there is No one higher than me for 3500km wow .. That’s very cool! Her Kristin,This is a real cool post. I liked it so much I reposted on my blogs facebook page 🙂 I thought I would have been to more but have only been to 3 places on this list! I think Tonsai Beach was my favourite chillest place thus far! A couple of cool chill places in India would be McLeod Ganj (gorgeous tibetan town in the foot of the Himalayas), Palolem Beach in Goa ($3 private beachfront cananas – yes please!) and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (go and stay in a castle for a few days eating amazing foods while watching the sun set from the roof of the castle). Have you been to any of these? Awesome, thank you! Thanks so much for giving me India tips! I am really looking forward to the time when I take off for an extended trip through there. Yes, Ella does sound very pretty and serene… And Pai? We’ve not heard of that before in Thailand. Another chill spot is Gili Air (one of the Gili islands off Lombok, Indonesia) – but don’t go to neighboring Gili T if you’re looking for “chill” as that’s quite a party island! We loved Koh Lanta in Thailand – found it very restful. But we hear a bridge is being built to connect it to Krabi, so rumour has it that the island may not stay so peaceful for long… I went to Gili T for a week right at the end of my first 10 months in SEA and have to say I really enjoyed it! I know it’s a party place but better for a solo traveler. I think Gili Air would have been awesome with a partner but my friend came back and said solo it was a little depressing.  You haven’t heard of Pai?! I’m obsessed with Pai! Go forth and visit! Thanks Kristin for exploring some best places of Asia through this post. Thanks for reading 🙂 Great post! I would love to check out Don Det, Laos. It seems like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. You’re website is pretty amazing. Hope my blog can be half as good as yours one day. That’s really kind of you, David! I would say you could be right assuming Don Det is like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. It’s still its own thing and its own place but both are worth checking out. Both are beautiful. Hi Kristin,I am headed to Southeast Asia in a few months but will only be able to stay for a little over a month. I am starting in Thailand and ending in Bali with a final night in Singapore. I am hoping to be efficient and get to see parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia as well. Any suggestions on how to make the most of your time while backpacking and ensure you get to see everything on your list? (Not your list specifically, just a list in general :-)) Any advice would be awesome!Thanks,Jordan You’re a bit limited with that timeframe and I’m sure you don’t want to burn yourself out with rapid movement, so I’d suggest seeing Angkor Wat in Cambodia, checking out an island such as Perhentian or Tioman in Malaysia, and exploring Hanoi and the surrounding areas in Vietnam, as those were the highlights for me and I bet you’d be pretty happy with those spots. So glad to hear it’s still good because I would like to return in May 🙂 Gah! I miss Pai so much and it was by far my favorite place in Thailand to visit. The hammocks, the sunsets, the night market, and the freakin’ food! I never made it to Tonsai but I’ll have to hit that next time I’m in Thailand. I feel like we are very alike in places we love to chill, so when I do finally get to Sri Lanka and China and the like, I’ll make it a point to check these out! we probably do have similar taste! Pai is always a wonderful place to be. I love your posts! And since I read the articles about Pai I just want to go there like immediately 🙂 in 2 weeks it is gonna be so far 🙂 Could you please share, where I can find this chill terrace from your Pai picture?  Wish you lots of fun on your further trips!! Thanks Maria! The photo is at the Container. OTRES BEACH brings back some serious ‘chill’ memories. Its amazing how its right down then way from the ‘main’ beach but its literally deserted.   Great choice! Glad to hear it’s still like that because I plan to return after 2.5 years away in May! Hi Kristin!I really enjoy your post, I ran into your blog for I will embark on my first solo trip in a couple months. I’ll be heading to Pai and I just love the picture you posted for Pai. Do you mind telling me the place. The one with the beautiful scenery and hanging chairs. Thanks It’s called the Container 🙂 HelloWhere in Pai is the photo with the swinging chairs taken? I’d love to go!K It’s called the Container, near Coffee in Love Hi, I will be travelling to southeast Asia in a couple weeks. Where are the hanging egg shaped seats in Pai? Thanks The Container Hello, is a great article. I hope sometimes i will visit Asia because is such a great place and i like their food Always wanted to visit Asia. And your post makes me want to make it happen more. Thank you! c”,) Indeed, Pai and the Land Split, are quite the Chill places! The snacks and beverages on those hammocks had me feeling like I was just floating on a cloud. I can still taste that yummy tamarind…mmmMMM. Hi Kristin! I’ll be back to Asia next year, and this is absolutely gold to include in my plans, thank you! I know you focus mainly in Southeast Asia, but if you ever decide to change destination, you could try Costa Rica 🙂 Puerto Viejo and Montezuma, even if are touristic places, have that chill vibe that make you question if you should leave everything to just live there! Thanks for the great post! I went through Costa Rica once for a week when I was in my early 20s and hit Belize the year after that for the same length of time. I’d love to move slowly through Central America the way I did through Southeast Asia. I’ve heard it’s a great place for slow travel as well Great post and I agree with otres being the best! I lived there for a while but do make sure you choose otres 2 not 1. kampot (a couple of hours) away is also amazing! Found some new gems from this for the next travels though. Great article. Thanks 🙂 There are 2 now? I figured it had started to grow…    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-is-traveling-in-china-like/,"China: The Awesome, the Annoying, and the Downright Scary",China,"“She charged us to wrap our bowls in plastic? But I don’t even want plastic around my bowl,” I said to Lynn after paying my portion of our lunch bill. “I know, but it costs them money to clean the bowl for us,” she explained. “Yeah but, that’s sort of an occupational hazard that comes along with owning a restaurant, don’t you think? You have to provide clean bowls.  Are you saying that if I brought my own bowl and chopsticks, I wouldn’t pay a bowl cleaning fee?” I retorted, coming off a little more annoyed than I meant to. “Yes, and I don’t know what to tell you, this is China, thats just how it is.” Lynn repeated this to me a few times over the next few days when I’d say things like, “what there’s no running water here?” or “Why is there never any toilet paper anywhere, but there’s always too much extra food leftover, bowls wrapped in plastic, and free tea?” This kind of confusion came to define my time in China, which was a bemusing, delicious, beautiful, challenging, and overall incredible two months of traveling. China is an anomaly for a lot of people.  It seems that Western tourists who visit usually come away with one of two impressions: either they love the raw travel experience or they hate the difficulty of it. Traveling in China is truly traveling – not just laid back tourism.  It can be disorienting, incredibly confusing, and completely different from anything most travelers previously have or will ever encounter again. Personally, I was thrilled with the opportunity to practice the Mandarin I had learned in Taiwan (albeit 6 years earlier with no practice in-between) and found myself loving some things and simply unable to grasp others. While this list is by no means exhaustive, and of course only one girl’s opinion, this list is what really stuck out to me as new and different in China: The Awesome Generosity The Chinese people I met were some of the kindest, most generous people I’ve ever encountered.  Generosity is ingrained in their culture and is especially evident at meal times. A typical meal in China is eaten family style, meaning that everyone has his/her own bowl of rice, and the rest of the dishes are communal and placed in the middle of the table, allowing everyone to try each dish that’s ordered. It’s also quite common to serve everyone else at the table tea (which usually comes free with the meal) and rice before serving oneself.  This courtesy extends to refills as well. What is perhaps the most surprising is how people argue over who is paying the bill – not because nobody wants to pay, but because everyone wants to pay! I’ve seen people almost get into playful fights shoving money at each other.  I have never been treated to more meals than in China.  I truly felt like a guest there. Helpfulness Chinese people were also often generous with their time, kindness, and patience, often going completely out of their way to help me. More than once someone has taken it upon him or herself to walk me to my hostel, a bus stop, to give me a free ride, and ask me where I’m going in an attempt to help me if I appear lost. I’ll always remember the hotel that let me stay in the room overnight without paying when I couldn’t get money out of any of the functioning ATMs.  I won’t forget Patchu who wandered for an hour to get me on a bus to Moxi, either.  These are just a few of the countless examples of people helping me out when they could. Physical Touch “I don’t think American girls do this,” my friend Stephanie said as she looped her arm through mine while we walked along the sidewalk in Chengdu.  “We don’t but we should,” I replied.  In China, friends of all ages from young to the very old, and of both genders, hold hands, link arms, and show affection in ways that we seem scared of in Western culture.   It’s really nice to walk along arm and arm with a friend, especially on a cold day. Hostels The hostels in China must be amongst the best in the world.  What you get for the money is just incredible.  Most run only $3-$6 dollars for a bed with a heated blanket, clean sheets, a nice bathroom with hot water, lovely grounds, and a good location. Beautiful Scenery Whatever background you come from and set of beliefs you subscribe to, however you believe the world was created, I think most would agree that a little more time was spent on China. The Annoying Pushing China is damn crowded.  This means people push and shove when trying to get onto a train, into an elevator, onto the metro, and especially onto a full bus.  There is no sense of “you were here first, please go ahead,” or, “I see you have been waiting, it is sensical that you order your food before I do.” At first I was annoyed, but then I realized if they wanted to push and shove, at about a head taller than everyone else in the crowd, the pushing game is one I would most definitely win.  Elbows up, suckers.  Spitting Everywhere The spitting. Oooh the spitting! It happens anytime, anywhere.  Busses are even equipped with buckets for people to spit into. The peace and silence of the most tranquil evenings has been ruined by the sound of someone hocking up a loogie. False Advertising From the chocolate-less “choco” cereal bar to the countless bottles of “soda” water that were without bubbles, I was disappointed by the packaging more than once in China.  My friend in Chengdu watched and laughed hysterically as four different times I said, “This! This will be the one! It says soda water!” (it even said it in Chinese, mind you) only to open the bottle, take a sip, and hang my head in defeat at the flat, sweet drink. Talking about the Waiguoren Wai guo ren literally translates to “person from an outside country,” and happens to be what every foreigner in China gets labeled.  Where I’m from, it’s incredibly rude to call someone a foreigner, but I am not from a mostly homogeneous society where it’s very clear from outside appearances who is and is not a citizen.  Therefore, I try not to mind the label. What I do mind is when people talk about me thinking I can’t understand.  A few times in Kunming, I was silently sitting on the bus, minding my own business, when a local boarded, pointed right at me and laughed, “ting bu dong!” (which means “can’t understand”).  At first I’d reply that, oh yes, I could understand.  It wasn’t as gratifying as I wanted it to be, so I simply gave up when I didn’t have the energy to reply. I’m sure I get talked about all the time in other countries I visit as well.  It’s just that elsewhere, I don’t speak any of the local language and I can’t understand. Table Manners the slurping, chewing with the mouth open, and worst of all, speaking with ones mouth full, are all completely acceptable in China. It drives me bat sh*t crazy! I recall someone asking me a question right after I had shoveled food in my mouth and watching his bewildered expression when I held up a finger to signify, “one minute, my mouth is full,” before replying. This is one of those areas where there’s a big cultural difference that I just couldn’t get used to, though I’m sure there were numerous things I was doing that they found rude or strange that are completely normal to me as well. No Water Sometimes in the towns along Tibet, there was simply no running water.  I was in these places to trek, so that meant I was sweating every day. By day two without showering I was pretty upset, feeling dirty and entirely glad there was nobody around who I was trying to impress. By the third day I stopped caring, and by the fourth day I didn’t even miss showering anymore. I was used to being dirty. Who needs a shower anyways? Amateurs that’s who. Downright Scary Gutter Oil Gutter oil is essentially waste oil collected from sewer drains, grease traps, and slaughterhouse waste and is repackaged and sold for about 2/3 of the price of new cooking oil.  In fact, it is estimated that one out of every ten restaurants in China uses gutter oil. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that this stuff is toxic.  It has even been linked to stomach and liver cancer when consumed over long periods of time.  When eating in China I ask to see the oil if it’s not already on display.  The fresh stuff will look like oil should while the dirty stuff looks grey an disgusting. Extreme Waste (packaging and food) There’s a lot of waste, especially surrounding food.  The amount of good food that goes uneaten during meal times is enough to feed an extra person or two.  It makes me feel very guilty when I’m the guest at a meal and am in no position to criticize the generosity, but am horrified by being party to so much waste. The US might be famous for portion sizes, but it has nothing on China.  Doggie bags are also unheard of. Additionally, there is far too much packaging. For example, a roll of mentos has three layers: a plastic outside, another layer of plastic inside, and a layer of foil. Oreos also have an extra tray in each roll to keep them solid. Most shareable snacks are wrapped in individual wrappers inside of the large bag.  it’s too much. Squatters Most bathrooms are only equipped with squatting toilets, or a simple cut in the tile.  The partitions between stalls are sometimes knee-high, and there are no doors.  In short, there is no privacy. Don’t even think about expecting toilet paper or a place to wash your hands. It’s not a big deal until you come to a town with no running water.  Imagine an overfilled squatter.  Yeah, pretty grizzly. Extreme Pollution The pollution is so bad in cities like Beijing that it sometimes bars planes from being able to land.  That’s pretty intense! During the three weeks I spent in Chengdu I saw the blue sky twice and rarely saw the sun.  It’s truly unfortunate because the city is a great place and one I could otherwise see myself spending more time in. The culprit is all of the mass expansion.  In any given place in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces where I traveled, there was constant construction everywhere.  What’s strange is half of the buildings I saw didn’t seem to be in use. Taking Children Outside to Defecate Is that dog crap you’re about to step in?  No, sir, that is human child feces, which somehow makes it even worse. I still can’t understand why I saw parents bringing their children outside to poop on the sidewalk. Why? You have a toilet in your house!  This waiguoren still felt honored to experience a culture I’ve learned about and wanted to see with my own eyes for years.  The good absolutely outweighs the annoying and scary, and I will most definitely be returning, squatting toilets, table manners, and all! Have you been to China or other countries where you have trouble understanding the culture? —  I LOVE this article!!!! We travelled through China for a little over a month and then  lived there for a year. You hit the nail in the head with everything 🙂 thanks for explaining China in such an honest way. And you’re right, the good far outweighs the bad!  If u want, have a look at these lists of ourshttp://www.goatsontheroad.com/10-things-well-miss-about-china/http://www.goatsontheroad.com/things-we-dont-miss-about-china/ Haha, some of your points had me laughing. I don’t doubt that speaking Chinese was a massive game changer for me and led to things that most tourists don’t have the ability to experience. I’m hoping through my detailed guides that can change. I’ll also be making a video with some common dialogue to help out anyone who wishes to travel there. I can’t wait to visit here in September.  Just bought my one way ticket to Beijing!  It’s going to be insanely challenging but I’m looking forward to it.  Now I just need to get my butt into gear and learn some Mandarin.  Great article! Wow so much I didn’t know about China! I am headed to India and Nepal this fall so I imagine I will run into a lot of similar things!! I’m in Nepal now and don’t feel there are a lot of similarities apart from the spitting. They’re very different cultures and both quite amazing in their own right. Thanks for your honesty! I didn’t know that the hostel in China could be so good, who would have ever thought that? I’ve never been to China but I don’t think I could deal with the excessive spitting and the noise they make while eating, that might just drive me a little crazy! I had no idea the hostels would be so excellent, either! I was really impressed. Sounds like quite the experience and one that you won’t be forgetting anytime soon!  My travelling buddy really wants to visit China after we explore Southeast Asia and explore the possibility of teaching there…it looks like a very interesting/different/incredible place. I headed there after about a year spent traveling around Southeast Asia and found it so exhilarating in comparison. It’s a lot more raw and challenging and it’s quite wonderful. You never really know what you might run into or see and that makes it so interesting to me. Love this post – all too often travel bloggers only talk about the beautiful, glossy parts of a destination. My first trip outside the west was to Shanghai and I still remember being completely confused, frustrated but exhilarated and entranced from the culture shock. Then I was hooked so I went to India which was even more challenging but life changing and totally worth it. For me, this is why I travel – to experience something completely different from our own culture, warts and all! If it was all easy it wouldn’t be nearly as rewarding! I am so interested in India! I’m with you – traveling in China and India is truly traveling and that’s the whole point of this thing for me. I love that you showed three different sides. All I can picture when I think about China is the ‘annoying’ category…it’s not very high on my travel list. Maybe somewhere far away from the cities! (And, um, kids pooping outside when there is a toilet inside? Did you ever get any clarification on this? Whaaa?) I love the rural areas of China but I loved Chengdu as well, which is a pretty big city. They both have a lot to offer. Yup, this sums up China pretty well!  I will NEVER get used to the table manners, the spitting (and blowing snot rockets) in public, or the kids pooping on the street, though… I’m with you. Some things I just can’t get used to. I do miss yelling for the boss when in a restaurant, though. It was so efficient! I certainly learnt a lot reading this post Kristin. While I knew that things were a little different in China I didn’t really realise just how much. I suppose they probably think that things we do and our way of life is odd too. Despite some of those not so nice things, I believe they add to making the travel experience unique. Definitely agree. They make China what it is – real traveling in a very different culture with lots to teach us foreigners. I trust the street food more because you can see them pouring the oil from the fresh containers into the pans. It’s all out there for you to see. In a restaurant is where you wouldn’t notice it. Ha! Great post, you made me laugh at times and then totally grossed me out with the Gutter oil and shitting on the sidewalk. My mom (who spends half the year in Chiang Mai, Thailand) regularly sends me links to Thai newspaper stories, many of which chastise the increasing number of Chinese tourists. There was a famous photo in one of a Chinese woman squatting and doing a number 2 in one of Chiang Mai’s canals. There’s a real backlash in Thailand against the Chinese who they consider rude and dirty.Nice to read about some of their better qualities though!Frank (bbqboy) Chinese tourists get a bad reputation around the world but they truly do  have some amazing qualities and I think, like any group of people, everyone is different and the group often gets blamed for the bad eggs. Absolutely love this post! I’ve been living in Hong Kong for a few years and only been to the mainland a few times, but I definitely get where you are coming from. You hear stories about this stuff like children defecating outside and think it can’t be real (or at least common)! It’s a nation that intrigues me. I just wrote a post about why Chinese Tourists are getting such a bad rap. Cheers! Hong Kong’s great, but it truly is nothing like mainland China! I saw the defecation. It’s real! Real gross. You know, I hated most of these things about China, but after so many months there, I learned to love them. I found it so strange, but also weirdly liberating, to drunkenly walk home holding hands with a new male friend (Chinese, of course). Granted, he grabbed my hand and wouldn’t let go of it, but it felt freeing because I didn’t actually have to be “scared” of anything! It’s totally normal there! And don’t even get me started on my first experience in a public restroom! I’m glad you’ve grown to love China as much as I do! It is really nice holding hands with friends! I saw old ladies holding hands as well and thought it was the cutest thing. They seemed to cuddle even more in Nepal!  I definitely love China. The spitting is what drives us mad, on night trains, and even in dorms. We had one guy in Chengdu who every half hour would wake up everyone by his hocking then spit it onto the wall beside him. Gross. Can manage it outside but inside??!! We’ve found the women here usually lovely but the men, especially in dorms, can be very ignorant and disgusting. Amazing beautiful country, the scenery is incredible, makes up for lack of manners ha ha That’s excessive. I think the spitting is from all the cigarette smoking. I find both men and women can be very nice but there are always bad eggs. Potty training in the streets — nice! I also heard that Chinese like to clap their hands..a lot. Something to do with acupressure points, I presume..Have you noticed this? There’s an exercise involving that. Might be some merit to it! Some great tips. But gutter oil? Are you for real? Yikes 🙁 Did you also have a palava trying to get the visa? (We are going in Aug/Sept after the trans siberian from Russia). Gutter oil is for real, sadly, yes. I didn’t have an issue getting a visa nor extending it but it wasn’t cheap. Oh yeah, this was my life for two years. Though in Shanghai the locals were a lot less friendly and helpful than they are out west. I used the same tailor the whole time I lived there and every time I walked in her shop she would call out “ting bu dong.” All I could do was smile and chuckle or else try to find a new tailor. I found living there to be equally fascinating and frustrating. How rude! I guess that’s just how it is, though, huh? Glad you could still enjoy your time and laugh it off. That’s all you can do sometimes! Interesting article, It’s always fun to read WAI GOU REN’s article about traveling in China, most things you’ve talked are common and true. I am from southeast of China, and one thing I may have different opinion, the name ‘WAI GOU REN’, in our culture, use this word is nothing offensive, China is big, and very diverse, people like use geographic name to label people, If I were traveling in ChenDu, the people there may label me as FUJIAN REN(because I am from Fujian Province), I don’t feel offensive at all, same rule applied, my ChenDu friends came to my hometown and visited me, my mom always call him: the SiCuan Boy/Girl. So don’t feel bad on that name. if you tell they you are from America, they may call you ‘MeiGou Ren’.  The education has changed entire Chinese society, splitting and outdoor defecating was done by everybody there(not only the kids), but now, most young generation doesn’t do that. People always need education, then they will know what is right and what is wrong.  I am living in New Jersey, and go back to China every year,  if you like, you can come to my hometown(FuJian) to experience different China, different food, weather, and crowd. You can always ask me what is Chinese thinking about things. I’d like to share. Thanks for your comment, Ming! I know Wai guo ren is not meant to be offensive, it’s just that in American culture (as I’m sure you know since you’re in Jersey), it is an offensive word. I knew it wasn’t meant that way when it was said about me, though. It just takes some getting used to. I’m Asian American, who’s now living in Asia for a short while.  Your blog’s awesome, good job! I’d like to add to your interesting commentary and the subsequent dialogue there. Perhaps it might be different in SoCal (as I’ve heard), although Americans may generally be less forthright in labeling a minority a foreigner outright, there’s no shortage of expressions directed to minority Americans and minority foreigners in the US, that communicate to us that the white American majority decides that we are condemned to be perpetually outsiders, based on race.  I’ve lost count on the number of times people assumed that I couldn’t speak English, that I wasn’t American, and I’ve even had guys who passed mildly offensive remarks while hitting on me, as absurd as that sounds. When I told somebody that I was divorced and my ex was white, that person even asked me if my ex “was much older and Asian women like older white men”, I remember feeling so shocked that I paused before telling him that actually my ex is younger than I am. I don’t know if it was because I was raised a lily-part region of America (the Midwest) and in one of the whitest states there (Missouri) that exacerbated things..maybe it isn’t so bad in other regions? My experience has told me otherwise. Northeast. South. Midwest. They’re all the same. I think California and Washington are the only places in the US that are notable exceptions.  Make no mistake. Racism directed at minorities in American is expressed differently than in Asia, or Europe, or Australia, because every place is unique. The racism that Americans wreaks on minorities, in particular Latinos and Asian Americans isn’t quite the kind of traditional racism Americans are familiar with (ie the racism experienced by Black Americans). Neither is it the same passing racism white people think they “endured” when traveling or teaching in Asia. It is far more insidious, masked as cruel or subliminal jokes, or simply just seeks to make Americans of other races feel like foreigners. And maybe that is intentional.  I used to think that only white Americans do that. But I’ve also come across white Europeans doing that. Of course, there are good and bad people in all races. But watching any white person complain about racism and accusing Asians of being allegedly “more racist” than anybody else they know or “more racist than what we can imagine in our civilized western world” always makes me chuckle. Nobody has the racism market cornered, but white people should be the last group to say they are slouches in this area. Hi Cheryl,I understand where you’re coming from, but unfortunately your comment here is actually inherently racist. I also never said that slurs are not passed in the United States. I know that they are. I just said that I was called a foreigner quite a bit, and that I realize in China it isn’t meant to be a slur as it would be in the US. That doesn’t mean I naively believe all white Americans refrain from using slurs. Even though I was not part of the ethnic majority where I grew up (because I am from Southern California and it is not majority-white), I am lucky that I wasn’t made to feel like an outsider where I grew up. I can imagine that must be very tough. Please don’t insert meaning or words into my post where I didn’t put them, though. I am not comparing China and the US, and I never called anyone racist in this post. I’m Chengdu ren (you went to my hometown) now in So Cal, love your post, and admire your courage to travel abroad alone. Being a Chinese some of your words really touched me. I’m glad to read that you love the post. I loved Chengdu! I loved this post! Like you, i spent several months living in Taipei, though it was almost thirty years ago. I studying Mandarin at the time as part of a master’s degree in East Asian history.Taiwan was similar in may ways to what you describe. Things like the wrapped bowl happened all the time.After six months there my visa ran out and I needed to get back to the US to finish my degree, but I spent a month in Hong Kong and the PRC before I went home. Travelling alone in China at that time was not as easy as it is now. Hitchhiking by gringos was very much frowned upon, if not actually illegal. While the list of cities and towns to which I could travel was fairly long, much of the country was legally accessable. Even in a big city like Xian or Beijing there were only a few hotels and hostels which non-Chinese (a term which included people from Hong Kong and overseas Chinese) could stay in.I did travel by boat, bus and train from Guangzhou to Xian to Beijing and made some friends, mostly Chinese, along the way. My Chinese was good enough bybthat point that I could carry on simple conversations, though nearly anyone who could speak any English at all wanted to try to use that instead. Generally people were very friendly and generous, even in a big city like Beijing. The manager of the hotel I stayed in there would come sit down at my table every day to chat while I ate a meal. Then there was sort of odd young woman whom I met in the trainstation somwhere who wanted to have a very serious conversation with me about the wise and great leadership of Chairman Mao.By the time I got to China I had gotten used to the more annoying things you talk about (the spitting, table manners, etc) but one thing I really found hard to deal with was the fear of drafts people seemed to have while riding the train. I was there in July and it was pretty darn hot. In spite of that, people keptall the windows on the train shut. When I would open one people all around me would give me the stink eye. Another was the litter. The ground all over places like the Forbidden City, the grottoes around Luoyang,the wall around Xian was covered with cigarette butts, food wrappers, popsicle sticks, etc. Taiwan was like that as well. Wow, I wish I could have seen it 30 years ago. I also lived in Taiwan and find it almost nothing like China. Trash is definitely still a problem in China, unfortunately. I didn’t know about drafts. That might be why the man behind me didn’t like the window open on the bus, but he was smoking…on a bus, so, Im sorry Pal, window is getting opened. Well, imagine those big broad avenues in Beijing with almost zero motorized vehicles on them. I remember seeing a cart pulled by a camel in either Xian or Beijing; I can’t remember which now. Beijing was actually eerily quiet for such a  large city. I had spent quite a bit of time in Bangkok a couple years before and contrast between the two, which were about the same size then, was pretty marked. Stumpled upon your blog through Twitter and I can so relate to this post!I have been living in China for 4 years now and there are things (like your last point) that I won’t be able to get used to. Ever. I still find myself missing China a lot! Amazing! Reminds me exactly of the month I spent in China.  I would love to go back and explore more!  Despite the toilets… and people picking their ears with their fingernails… The toilets were easily the scariest I’ve ever encountered. I don’t think they can even be called toilets. That’s really saying a lot considering the places I’ve been! What a great post.I can understand how you could either love it or hate it. A bit like India really. So i’ve heard! please also realize that they were nice to you because you are a wai guo ren and wanted to leave you with a good impression, they aren’t actually like that genuinely and towards each other if you are not family, friend or close relation. don’t look too much into the kindness/generosity, it ain’t real I actually have a somewhat different experience about china. altho i LOVE hong kong, i just cant fall in love with china with all the craziness and nonsense. that said, i think china is a country worth visiting.  i love hong kong. its a fusion of east and west. i understand why it could a bit too much for some people, but i just love it. theres more americans than i thought! growing up in illinois/indiana, i didnt get to make many friends born to an immigrant family (im a 2nd gen chinese american). it was hard sometimes cuz no one understood the culture tension i had with my parents. but there, i made friends with so many asian americans who love hong kong/cantonese culture and also identify with my american heritage/value! hong kong is just THE place and i definitely want to live there for at least a couple years.  i then crossed the border to mainland china. my first stop was shenzhen and then i went to guangzhou where my family is from. I like them both. to my surprise, people didnt order more than we could eat and they packed there leftover home. i didnt see no one defecating on the streets either. not many spitters either (more in beijing. becuz of the pollution there?). i was okay with squatters tho (cuz japan also has some squatters (not a lot). they call it Japanese-style toilet. toilets we see in america are called western-style toilet) shanghai was pretty nice too. but i hate how racist they could be. i learned some surviving mandarin. i tried to ask for directions in chinese and got yelled at for no cause! i then explained in english that i was raised in america and couldnt speak chinese. he smiled (out of nowhere) and reached to my hand. I was like, dudeeee, wtf?? he took me to where i wanted to go. i had no idea wtf just went down there. i was later told i was treated better cuz he realized im a foreigner. ( couple days later, it was on the news that a japanese guy lost his bike which was immediately found by shanghai’s finest. some of my chinese friends told me that was only becuz he was japanese) i also dont like the hatred some chinese had against japan i saw in nanjing, a city south of shanghai. cuz i have been to japan three times and thats one of my 2 fav countries in asia (another one is thailand).  beijing was just too much. i loved the traditional chinese castles. but the pollution and spitting!? to top it off: deep fried insects. ewwwww. but i cant complain too much about beijing either cuz thats where i met my roommates/good friends i now live with in boston! before i went to china, i had a 7 day layover in japan. i met a new yorker at a bar in tokyo who had spent 5 years in japan and warned me to expect some craziness, surprise and culture shock in china, especially i was going from japan.  people say manhattan real estate is like check-in at an italian airport: theres no rules. i say living in china is like watching a japanese game show: i never know what is going on. but people in china enjoy more freedom than i thought. people could still find there way to western media or fb. people were nice to me, which is great but thats just becuz i m a chinese american from america: i felt kinda bad for other chinese, including my parents, who were mistreated by the country. maybe i didnt stay long enough. i do want go visit rural areas in china/southeast asia. i would like to do business in china but to live there? nahhh. The rural areas are where you’ll see more people using the sidewalk as a toilet. Definitely found that quite strange, but I’m not judging, just observing. I have heard and in these comments have been told that the way I was treated was because I’m a foreigner but I traveled with Chinese locals and they were treated the same as I was, so I think you get out what you put in, that’s what I always say. I came across your blog a while ago when I was thinking about traveling south east asia, and now i return with a massive plan to travel asia and am so glad you came across china! speaking to an aunty who visit the place, her having chinese in her, she found it the most difficult country to travel through. i just wanted to know if it really is as expensive and if the language barrier really is a massive issue? i really want to go through all the beautiful places like Guilin and Xian and Hangzhou, but how difficult is it to travel through China with little to no chinese language skills! The thing is, I do speak Mandarin so it wasn’t nearly as hard for me. Because of this, people would take me under their wing or tell me secret places to visit, or invite me to meals, and that wouldn’t have happened without my ability to speak. Definitely learn at least some. Pleasantries and numbers are the most important. I was thinking of making a video with survival Mandarin to help anyone looking to travel there, because it is difficult otherwise. Would that be something that you’d like? The places you mention are more firmly on the tourist trail, though, and people travel there all the time. It just won’t be as easy as Southeast Asia, but honestly that’s part of the reason why I loved it so much. That’s an useful post. I’m preparing for a trip to China, and keep telling myself that it is not so different from India. But gutter oil is something new. I’m sure it’ll be plenty different but if you’ve successfully navigated India then you’ll do just fine in China. I lived in China for nearly a decade, and my appraisal of the country, people, and language is unremittingly negative. Until the Chinese begin to behave in a way that does not run counter to every civilised norm in countries such as Vietnam, Nicaragua, or Russia, then they shall have a deservedly poor reputation. Note I do not compare them to Norway, Canada or Denmark – that would be a cruel joke. It’s too bad you left with such a negative viewpoint after living there for so long. I found there were two kinds of travelers in China: Those who fought against the differences and resented them, and those who embraced the new culture and tried to learn and be a part of it. I don’t think of the Chinese as rude because in that culture the things that are rude are different than in other cultures. That’s ok – the same is true for American behaviors abroad. I found other things, such as the hospitality and generosity, to make up for what I initially found to be rude.  I also really enjoy the language, love to practice it, and think it’s so sensical. Like building sentences with building blocks. It’s fascinating. China hand, do the Chinese a favour and never go back, you close minded tool. China is a take it or leave it country. Its global stature and economic dominance means that It doesn’t NEED western tourism dollars like the SE Asian countries do, and therefore marches entirely to its own beat. One day soon enough, a rich Chinese family will displace you from whatever comfy, western neighborhood you live in and then we’ll see who gets the last laugh. Nathan Chang – shut up you brain dead fool.  PS you stink of shit and have obviously never used toilet paper. Hahaha, I loved the “elbows” remark.  I’m 6’1″, so I discovered that for myself as well. With my arms crossed at my lower chest, they are level with everyone’s faces.  When I’m the first one off the subway (in the middle like I’m supposed to), I can hear all the people trying to push me back exclaiming “aiyaaaa” as they ram their own faces into my elbows. They are supposed to wait and enter from the sides after everyone exits from the center. I would also recommend to everyone to learn to speak and read as much Mandarin as you can, it’s not that difficult, and it only gets easier.It’s great fun to preemptively strike against the people who would otherwise be saying obnoxious things about you, by talking loudly in Mandarin about THEM, first.I’m not even that great, I can’t read novels without heavy use of a dictionary yet. I’m probably at the same level as you and I agree it’s not that hard. I don’t know why it has that reputation because the language is quite simple and doesn’t even require conjugation. I love that. I guess it’s the tones which I’ve noticed some foreigners never manage to master, but it’s all about listening over and over (and over) I absolutely loved reading your take on Chinese culture. We experienced many of the same things during our travels two years ago. This is so wonderful what you’re doing and I’m extremely jealous of you! Aw thanks Kelley. I found overall that I really appreciated the culture and the hospitality, despite the sometimes frustrating and confusing parts 🙂 yes…chinese ingenuity….now some scavengers in india also picked up this technique and making biryani with gutter oil…its downright scary to say the least… —the slurping, chewing with the mouth open, and worst of all, speaking with ones mouth full— I am not sure if this is Chinese culture, but i tend to think this is a bad habit–peasant like behavior.  I am the 4th generation of overseas Chinese, and I remember my late Grandpa would give me a scold if i did that when i was young. As overseas Chinese, we did not go through the PRC cultural revolution that destroyed most of our cultures and replaced them with the peasant like ones. Mind you, we are not rich or somewhat high class, we are small shop-owner and Grandpa can read Chinese characters but not highly educated or like that. Our family meals is pretty much like what you described, but when we have guest among us, we would have extra spoon or chopsticks for all to use instead of our own.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/siguniangshan-four-sisters-mountain/,Siguniang Shan: Magnificent Mountains You’ve Probably Never Heard Of,China,"Sichuan province in China has been full of amazing treks that I had otherwise never heard of nor would have ever known existed. It was all divulged to me when, at a youth hostel in a town between Chengdu and Lugu Lake, an enthusiastic hostel employee sat with me and told me every place she thought I should visit after I spoke a few words of Mandarin to her and she realized she’d be able to communicate with me.  Showing me photos of each place on China’s version of Google, she then invited me to join her for the employee dinner, which was delicious and a great introduction to food in Sichuan province. One of the areas she told me I must see is Siguniang Shan (Four Sisters Mountain) East of Chengdu in Sichuan province’s Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.  Yet another sacred hiking place a bit like Yubeng, it was poised to be a trek that most foreigners aren’t aware of and haven’t had the opportunity to see. After blindly following a very wrong set of information online on how to get there, I went to the incorrect bus station (the Western bus station) where the ticket sales lady gaped at me like I was completely insane, or incredibly stupid, or perhaps both.  An outside observer told me I needed to get to the ChaDianzi station, which was a good 15 minutes away by taxi.  I ended up finally making it at the last minute right as the bus was about to make the 8-hour journey.  Most of the drive was bumpy and through some of the ugliest, most polluted mining towns I’ve ever seen. Then, just as we crossed over the mountain, the sky became blue and the vistas so impressive that almost everyone in the bus crowded around the windows as the bus navigated the winding roads, clamoring for a photo opportunity. After de-bussing (after the driver yelled “kuai yi dian!” (hurry up!) at us to get our bags and let him be on his way, I looked around the tiny town without much clue where to stay.  I wandered until finding a particularly outgoing woman who ushered me into her guesthouse.  At only $5 per night for my own room, it sounded pretty good to me.  Even better, on a daily basis she took it upon herself to find hiking buddies for me so that I wouldn’t be alone, in addition to cooking some of the best lamb I’ve ever had the pleasure of tasting. Between she and the kind Tibetan woman who warmly chatted with me each morning about my day’s plans as I bought water and snacks, I felt right at home. There are three valleys in the Siguniang Shan area, two of which give the hiker a great view of the peaks of the four sisters mountains. I chose to hike Haizi gou (海子沟), a valley known for having beautiful lakes and a great view of the mountains.  Unfortunately, I never made it to the lakes as my hiking partners liked to take frequent and long breaks, but it was nice to have some company and I enjoyed the 10 or so km we made it in all the same. The other I chose to hike was Shuangqiao Valley (双桥沟), which requires a minibus or public bus from Rilong town the 5 or so km to the entrance. This valley is a bit different as a bus runs through it, so it is possible to hop on and off the bus without ever having to walk.  There is also the option to walk along the 30km mostly-flat boardwalk from the far end back to the entrance, or a portion of it, which is what I elected to do. My guesthouse owner, ever the kind and sharp woman, found another guest with a motorbike who was also planning to go that day, so he took me along for free.  It was perfect, we ended up walking the entire boardwalk back and it gave me the opportunity to practice my Mandarin. Do it Yourself: Never tire of mountain views – thanks for sharing these with us! Im planning to hike Mt.Shiguniang in this Late March , can you give me any loval guide contact or any guest house owner contact then i can discuss and talking about my Climbing.Thanks Wow, those mountains look unbelievable! Fantastic photography Kristin! Thanks so much! Absolutely stunning! And it looks like you had a lot of fun. I have such an obsession with snow being that I come from somewhere that it never snows or even gets cold enough for it to be possible. Same, I am not used to snow so it was new to me to be hiking in it! Nikon D3000 for the ones you see here. A big part of making the photos come out well is also in the processing. I use lightroom and think it’s probably the most user friendly out there for what it can do Great post!You got some amazing shots of the mountains. Love the one where your floating lol tippy! Stunning! So glad you made it there 🙂 Me too! Did you hike here as well? Beautiful! I thought I had seen a lot of China when I was there, but your posts are showing me the error of my ways. This is definite inspiration for a return trip! Do you know how to get here from Lijiang? Lijiang is really far away. I think you’ll need to get to Chengdu first. hi,  Would you recommend a guide if we planned to summit one of the mountains? One of the four sisters? Yes, I think that would probably be wise. Hi KristinWe are planning to visit Siguniang Shan in a few weeks. How many days needed at least to see all most stunning places? How can we go here from Chengdu? Thank you for any adviceGitta Hi Gitta,In the “do it yourself” portion of the post at the bottom, the very first point is how to get there from Chengdu by bus. I was there for 2 nights and saw one whole valley and half of the other, but if you want to see the whole of all of them then you’d need to plan for overnights in two of the valleys, so it just depends on how much time you can devote to it. I discuss a bit more about that in the do it yourself portion as well. Do you know how much a guide is per night? We are bringing all our own backpacking gear. Actually, I’m hoping to develop a 7 night adventure and take friends on it in the future. I’m thinking 4-5 locations, and perhaps a summit hike. Hike up a day and camp two nights in each location, giving us a rest day to go explore without packs.  So my question is, do you believe it is huge enough to explore for an entire 7 nights? I imagine doing a couple nights in Changping and then 3-4 nights in Haizi.  Another big question is people. We really want to avoid seeing other people or man made structures. Do you feel it is touristy there at all? Not very touristy. The people you’ll encounter should mostly be locals. I have no idea about the guide as it isn’t something I have looked into. The guys at Zhilam Hostel (http://zhilamhostel.com) are very helpful in that regard, though. Though this isn’t really their area of jurisdiction, they can probably still help with guides there, or with suggestions in other areas. They’re Americans who own a hostel in the area and even speak Tibetan. Their guide, Patchu, is awesome. Hope that helps. My friend & I intend to visit Mt Siguniang in Marvh 2016, Can you advise where to stay in Rilong t& he nearest hostel available near ChaDianshi station in Chengdu.Do you have a planned itinerary to follow?What to pack along for beginners to the mountain? I Just showed up and walked down the street until a woman waved me over in Rilong. There’s plenty of space and that’s the time of year that I went. Bring a good jacket for the snow and the itinerary is at the bottom of the post. I didnt stay near ChaDianzi I was in an apartment with a friend and just took the MRT over. It’s easy there’s a stop right there. Hi – I’m interested to trek Dafeng and Erfeng. Do you know if I can DIY like in nepal? Thanks! Hm, haven’t heard of those so I’m not the person to ask, sorry! Hello!  The scenery there is amazing! I am thinking of exploring this area in May-June this year! May I ask how long did you take to complete the entire trek (how many days did you take)?Did you choose to hike the valleys only or you added in a peak as well? Hope to hear from you soon! I just did the valleys and spent one day in each. Hi – I’d just like to say, fantastic information and well constructed post! The photos you took are incredible! Were you there in September?  Thanks! I was there at the beginning of April 🙂 hi great pics! how long would you recommend staying there for? 2 or 3 nights? and how easy is it to arrange staying at a separate guesthouse if you do a 2 day hike. thanks I just showed up and booked in person, which I think is probably the best (and maybe only?) method. I’d give it at least 3 nights if you want to see all of the valleys. Even longer if you want to make it to the end of each one. Hi Kristin, Did you inquire about the cost of riding a horse or mule for a day going up Changping or Haizi?  Were the horses walking significantly faster than what you could walk to cover more area? I did not inquire. I was so broke back then I was hitchhiking to get around so it wasn’t even on my mind. The group I was with stopped super often to smoke so I know that I could have gone up significantly faster on my own and at least made it to the first lake. Horses will always be faster though. Are there banks / ATMs in Rilong, or should we bring all necessary money with us? Bring money as there weren’t when I was there. Wow! Thank you so much for this blog. I’ve been searching for “decent” and real-time blogs on Google about Changping and Shuangqiao valleys. and I have to say, this is by far the most in-depth guide. I’ll be travelling to Chengdu this September and plan to visit placed such as: Changping (overnight, Shuangqiao, Danba(Jiaju Village), Tagong, Xinduqiao, Hailuogou, and Kangding. I’m not sure if I can make it for just 6-7 days, though. Thinking of hiring a car with driver to save time, considering the “waiting game” of buses and mini-vans, but it costs an arm and a leg. :/  Anyway, I would love to hear from you and learn from your trip. Cheers! Consider getting in touch with these guys:  They’re an American couple who has owned a hostel in Kangding for quite some time and they can help with organization, or at least passing along some advice: https://zhilamhostel.com/ I stayed with them and thought it was a lovely place.  Have fun! I’ve got more at http://www.bemytravelmuse.com/china-guide as well Thanks for this post! It really inspired us to consider visiting Siguniang Shan. I was wondering if you could comment on the difference between the hiking/conditions in Siguniang Shan and Yading. We only have time to go to one (in early/mid-April–around when you went to them, I think), and we’re having trouble deciding. We enjoy long hikes but don’t have the gear for overnight treks or super challenging conditions (heavy snow/below freezing weather). Also, did you find either one to be more stunning than the other or were they just different? Thanks! Thanks for this post! It really inspired us to consider visiting Siguniang Shan.

You can find huts to sleep in overnight or you can just do day hikes in both places. Nice one – not many blogs about Siigunianghsan great blog. did you need a “tibet entry permit” to visit this area? Not at the time that I went but it’s always subject to police discretion at the time. Dear Kristin, Great blog.  May I know from which valley did you take the last photo “Mountains never stop being beautiful”? I’m hoping to be there this September. Shuangqiao Valley (双桥沟) Dear Kristin, Great blog.  Can you tell me from which valley did you take the photo “The mountains never stop being beautiful”? Thanks. Shuangqiao Valley (双桥沟) Thank you 🙂 (Sorry for the multiple posts) Hello,Im considering btw Changping and shuaingqiao valley. Can you give me some advice? Thank you very much!Trang Um, advice is in the post! If you can be more specific perhaps I can help. I believe a bus would ferry tourists to an entry gate, at drop-off, each tourist get to walk the pathway into the valleys and lakes at their own pace to soak in the scenic sights. I wish to ask you, if you could kindly share with me:1) How long the walking distance to and fro (kms please!)?2) Is it a steep winding and tedious, perilous walkways up the valleys?3) At altitude of 3000m+, oxygen level would be low, do the pathways provide rest stops?4) For a 56 years old man like myself, though I had walked up some Bhutanese mountains, I not sure how tough this one would be? I hope you able to shed some lights, so as I am physically and mentally well prepared, and not spoil my son – who is my traveling pal – enthusiasm and adventurous spirit, in case every 3 steps of the way, I have to take in 3 minutes of oxygen, then the journey would be arduous and long…. Appreciate your valuable pointers! Hi Kenneth, it depends on which valley you do. The wooden walkway I referenced is flat, but the others are steeper. None that I did were particularly difficult, and the one with the bus can pick you up partway if you don’t feel like finishing. Hi Kristin,I know this post is from some time ago but in your memory how was the drive from Chengdu. I’ve read that it can be pretty hairy. Thoughts? They were doing construction at the time so it must be different now. It’s winding mountain roads that can be snowy depending on time of year but it was also beautiful.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hitchhiking-in-sichuan-china/,Hitchhiking in China (Part 4): The Bone Bracelet Gift,China,"<— Part 3 Patchu is a hiking guide who took it upon himself to see to it that I made it to Moxi and back from Kangding, near the Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan province of China, all in one piece. Once he realized I could speak a bit of Mandarin, also a second language for him, he immediately took me under his wing and made it his pet project to get me to Moxi to see the red rocks, something I had expressed I had traveled all 12 hours from Emei Shan to see.  It was an additional 4 hours by car to get there, and everyone I asked said my only option would be to hire a private car for over $100.  I simply couldn’t swing it. Through the morning snow, Patchu walked the twenty minutes into Kangding town with me and told me that he would help me take a local bus in order to get there – an area I had been warned might be off limits to tourists at the moment given the ever-tenuous relations between Tibet and the Chinese government. It took about an hour, but we finally found a mini bus bound for Moxi. He repeatedly verified with the driver the plan to take me to Moxi and pick me up the next morning to return me to Kangding for only $18 — the local price — which is exactly how it ended up. Patchu is part of the Tibetan minority, a group of people I have come to really enjoy spending time with.  Not only do I find that they tend to be incredibly happy and friendly, but I also find them to be quite a handsome people.  They have shiny, thick black hair – the women often growing theirs to their knees, or tying it up in a braided crown of bright, red threads. They tend to be tall, with tanned skin, rose-red cheeks, and eyes that look like the rising sun.  Eyes that, even if the rest of the face is solemn, are perpetually smiling. So, when I returned to Kangding and told Patchu that I couldn’t stand another long bus ride, he gave me a benevolent smile and told me which intersection to wait at to go to thumb a ride back to Chengdu. The next morning I stood out in the cold for about 10 minutes.  Various cars passed by, some only going part way, some laughing and shrugging, indicating, “I’m sorry! My car is full!” Then an SUV pulled up with two young men inside bound for Chengdu.  I realized immediately that, just as the last time I had hitchhiked alone, I was going to have to think and work hard to make conversation flow during this long ride.  The driver asked me questions like whether I like singing and if California is flat or mountainous.  For the most part we were able to communicate relatively well, but I sure did miss Ya Ting who had been with me the majority of the previous times. The driver took every curve with incredible white knuckle-inducing speed, as if he knew the roads like the back of his hand. He didn’t, though. It had been his first time in Kanding, which didn’t exactly make me feel more at ease.  By the time we’d made it through the twists and turns of the mountains my gluteal muscles were sore from overuse trying to remain in my seat, as opposed to flailing like a rag doll across the back seat bench. Every now and then when a traffic jam impeded our progress, we’d chew on the spicy, gamey, but tender and lean yak meat jerky they’d bought a year’s supply of.  When traffic cleared up, it was back to break-neck speed down winding and broken roads. The real surprise of the trip came when they took me to lunch to try a famous Ya-An fish in a town along the way.  The driver hand selected the perfect fish, ordered entirely too many other dishes, and asked the waitress to make a bracelet for me out of the “double edged sword” bone in the fish’s head. Whoa, seriously? It is officially the oddest but also the most unique jewelry item I’ve received to date.  It’s also potentially lethal as it’s incredibly sharp, shaped like a sword, and dangles around some major veins on my wrist.  I’m keeping this one as a look-at-but-don’t-touch souvenir. Potentially the coolest souvenir, ever, that is. All in all, I’ve traveled over 1,805 kilometers (1,122 miles), half of that distance completely solo, in 13 different cars in China solely on the kindness of strangers.  I didn’t do it for any reason other than thrill of the adventure and opportunity to delve deeper into local culture than otherwise possible.  Though I have since hung my hitchhiking hat and opted for busses, it’s an experience I’ll always treasure and remember as some of the wildest times of my travels in China. Thank you for joining me on the journey. You seriously rock! No YOU rock! Thanks 🙂 That is one wicked(ly dangerous) souvenir! Very cool, love the red rocks to, very mystical looking! It was so cold there too! Sounds like an amazing experience and awesome souvenir!  The red rocks are really pretty as well 🙂 I thought they were a bit overrated but it was a cool experience That is one hell of a cool bracelet. Thanks for sharing your China hitchhiking experience. To me, I think it captures the spirit of adventure and travel. Thanks Kenneth, it was definitely an adventure I’ll never forget. Another great adventure! Good to know you are ok and not lost somewhere in those mountains 🙂 That’s so brave and cool of you to hitchhike such a long distance, especially alone. It’s fun to read about your adventures! Best of luck with your upcoming trips! Thanks so much Erica! Very intrepid of you! Do you have a picture of this fascinating bracelet to share please? I have it at home, I’ll take one next time I’m there!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mount-emei-china/,Mount Emei: Sacred Spaces in Sichuan,China,"There I was in Emei Shan (Mount Emei), yet another sacred place, following Yubeng and Lugu hu, two visually dissimilar places that had a similar significance as a sacred place for Buddhism in southern China. Emei shan is one of four sacred Buddhist mountains in Sichuan province.  Located a few hours’ bus ride away from the big city of Chengdu, it’s a small town with a big meaning for those of the Buddhist faith, as well as a UNESCO Word Heritage Site.  For me, it was another mountain to climb. Due to its significance and popularity, the Emei shan hike has been paved with stairs, as is common with many big Chinese attractions.  One can even skip the hike altogether and take a bus all the way to the top and a combination of cable cars and busses back down to the bottom.  That seemed silly to me, so I elected to use my feet, having heard that the lower portion of the hike is even more beautiful than what can be seen at the top. I don’t agree with that statement, though.  Not even a little bit.  Not at all. I’m sure the layered mountains and beautiful trees are a stunning sight, if that is, you can actually see them.  Sadly, the pollution, I assume from Chengdu, is so bad that I could barely make out what I was seeing: I started at Wainian temple which is a 20-minute bus ride from Baoguo. It’s a good place to start as it cuts out the lower first 20 or so kilometers and still leaves you with a steep 30 kilometer hike to the summit, which makes it doable in one day. The trail is pretty easy to figure out, passing through several temples along the way up the seemingly never-ending stairs I don’t know if it’s because I’ve had so many hikes since then, or if that hike truly was one of the most brutal, grueling hikes possible, but at fewer than 20 kilometers I still feel that Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo is the toughest hike I’ve done, and it took me even longer than Emei shan which was a full 10 km longer. A couple of enthusiastic snack vendors towards the top invited me to sit and have a rest while telling me all about how great the weather was that day.  Really? Even with all this smog?   Given, I had read previous accounts of getting to the top and being unable to see a thing due to too much fog, made worse by the annoying monkeys, neither of which I encountered. Which is good, because I don’t like fog and I really don’t like monkeys! I guess I got lucky, because after climbing the last few icy stairs (losing my footing more than once, grateful there was a railing to cling onto), I finally ascended above the smog line and was rewarded with this at the 3099 meters (10,167 feet) high summit: I was lucky and ended up meeting a fellow American (and a Calfornian at that!) along the way who I was able to share a room with that night, given the hotels at the top charge a minimum of 300 RMB (USD $50) per room!  I wanted to see the famed sunrise, though, and it seemed there was no choice but to pay it. In the end I was glad I did, because although the monasteries 10 kilometers lower charged much less, I would have never seen this: Do it Yourself: Oh wow! What a perfect looking place. And you pictures Kristin as stunning. Thanks for sharing. Thanks Jen! At first I was like, this sucks, I’m just hiking through pollution.  You’re right, though, in the end it made for a stunning sunset! Wait a second, have you interacted with them before? They’re rabid, biting, stealing, rabies-infested creatures! I used to think they were awesome until I dealt with them in person, and one almost bit me simply because I was walking by. Whoa! The photo of the Elephant and the sunset is simpley breath-taking!!! Thank you 🙂 Spectacular! We only had time for one day trip when we were visiting Chengdu (there to see the pandas) and chose the Leshan Buddha over Emei Shan. But I look forward to making this hike the next time we’re in the area! Wow. Breathtakingly beautiful. Must be bloody difficult to leave a place like that Absolutely stunning. I saw this place on idiot abroad, hilarious having HIM climb that. Sucks about the smog and pollution, I’ve heard that effects a lot of places people visit in China close to big cities. Amazing. Definitely finding that video and watching it. Thanks for the heads up. Emei shan, one of the sacred Buddhist mountains in Sichuan province China is stunningly beautiful . Your grandiose photos have been able to capture its magnificence. You did mention some pollution in Chengdu City? Funny it doesn’t show in the photos. Amazing views and thanks for the gorgeous photos. We did a hike to the double-decker living root bridges (made from rubber tree roots) in Meghalaya recently. 3.5 km of stairs going up, thought that was bad enough!  The bridges themselves and the views were beautiful though. Good luck with the Annapurna trek! Very cool! I’d love to try that out. I would never venture on that staircase if it weren’t for your photo of the view at the top! I would love to be there. It’s the endless stair master! I´d say the only way to make a trip to this sacred place a beautiful experience is by walking all the way up there. Personally, I don’t see a point in having yourself driven up to the summit and share it with thousands of tourists. The scenery up at the mountain top — I´m speechles.. stunning pictures! I don’t see the point of bussing up either but most people seem to choose that option! Wow. I forgot how it looks like up there! Haven’t been there since 2007. i remember that the steps were rather slippery. Some of my friends and I slid some stairs and fell. Great pictures! The snow made them super slippery! So amazing views! My sichuan tour has been delayed but still looking for some useful tips around It’s just the fog Brown, soupy fog? Looks so amazing! I am planning to do this at the beginning on September, how long did it take you to get to the top? I’m finding it difficult to get information about it. I walked 30km of stairs so it took all day. Hi Kristin,When did you take this trip? You’re talking about icy stairs and I want to do this hike in the beginning of december, so I wanna know whether I’ll be neading a pair of those crampons or not. 🙂Thank you! It was in March but you might have snow in December. They sell crampons along the way just in case. Your photos are so breathtaking!! Will visit end of May 2017. Thanks for sharing. Awesome have fun! LMK if these tips are still good! Without a doubt the most brutal hike I’ve ever done.Soooooooo many stairs. Word. So. Many. Stairs.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-cities-to-visit-in-germany/,The 15 Best Cities to Visit in Germany,Germany,"I will always have love for my home away from home of nearly five years – Germany. From the cooler than cool streets of Berlin to the beautiful castles in Baden-Württemberg, Germany has so many cities worth visiting, a trip to Germany alone is more than worth it.  The following are 15 of the best cities to visit in Germany, with some major cities and smaller towns sprinkled in for the perfect variety:  As someone who lived in Berlin for over 4 years, naturally this takes the first spot on my list not because it’s the most charming nor beautiful city in Germany – far from it – but because of its soul. Berlin is enigmatic, has a colorful counterculture history, and is full of artists and street art.  Berlin has things that no other city can offer, like Teufelsberg, a crazy spy dome-turned art paradise, and Tempelhofer Feld, the largest inner city open space in the world, and nightlife that can keep you going all week long. Read more about what to do in Berlin, where to stay, and how to love it in the winter, too.  On the border of Berlin, Potsdam feels like a page out of a storybook. A large part of the town hosts a sprawling UNESCO World Heritage Site which is home to Schloss Sanssouci castle, which is often referred to as the Versailles of Germany. Kings and kaisers lived in Potsdam until the 20th century, so the whole town is brimming with German history. Three of the five original city gates still stand and are worth checking out not only for their sheer age but for their architecture, and two historic market squares still exist.  Interestingly, Potsdam has some unique neighborhoods that reflect history which isn’t German: the streets in the Dutch Quarters are lined with 18th-century Dutch-style brick houses, while the wooden houses of Russia Town make you feel like you’ve temporarily stepped out of Germany. Potsdam is sure to make a charming trip, whether for just a day or for a long weekend! Baden-Württemberg is my favorite state in Germany for castles, waterfalls, the famous Black Forest, and delicious food. Stuttgart is the perfect jumping off point for a magical road trip through all of the aforementioned, and is perfect at any time of year.  For car lovers, this region is home to Porsche and Mercedes, and for those who want a more charming feel than one can get from, say, Berlin, Stuttgart is a lovely spot to base yourself for your Germany adventures. You can read more about the best day trips from Stuttgart here, and the best regional Christmas markets, too! The second largest city in Germany, Hamburg is situated on the Elbe River in northern Germany and has its own unique modern-meets-classic style. At the same time, it is reminiscent of Paris, London, Venice, and Amsterdam: small islands splitting the river, tall clock towers rising above the rooftops, hundreds of canals, and rows of skinny brick houses on the water seem to pay homage to these other famous European cities.  Start by exploring HafenCity, a new urban part of Hamburg which includes Speicherstadt — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — and the modern Elbphilharmonie concert hall with its 360-degree viewing platform at the top. Check out the street art in the Schanze and Karolinenviertel neighborhoods, or stroll through the Sunday morning fish market by the Elbe. You can even explore the city from the water by renting a kayak, canoe, or stand-up paddle board!  Bad Schandau is a charming town on the outskirts of Saxon Switzerland, a national park that is not really near Switzerland, but shares a border with the Czech Republic. The park is characterized by sharp sandstone rock formations, carved by the Elbe River. There are several day hikes, a few multi-day hikes, and some rock climbing routes as well. The famous Bastei Bridge is another sight worth seeing in the park, and Bad Schandau is the perfect place to base yourself while you explore. Read more about Saxon Switzerland here.   Lübeck, a quaint town of red brick and tiny winding alleyways in northern Germany, is over 850 years old! The first thing you’ll see in the city is Holstentor, or the gate to the city with two huge cylindrical towers. (It almost looks like a mini castle!) Walk around and explore the UNESCO World Heritage Old Town, visit the Marienkirche (church which was built somewhere between 1250 and 1350), and wander through the St. Annen-Museum to view some of Germany’s most prized artwork. Climb the tower at St. Peter’s Church for awesome views of the whole city, like in the photo above. Finally, eat some marzipan! The sugary almond treat was created here, and they have countless shops full of it and even a museum. All in all, Lübeck is sure to deliver on quintessential German charm.  The city of Rostock sits on northern Germany’s Warnow River. Home to the oldest and largest university in northern Europe, Rostock is recognizable by its colorful gabled houses and brick Gothic architecture.  While there, explore St. Mary’s Church, which dates back to the 14th century; be sure to take a look at its intricate astronomical clock and elaborate stained glass windows. After, stroll the city’s main street, the Kropeliner Strasse; check out the Dutch paintings at the history museum; and see the Baroque-style town hall built in 1270, which is pink! Kick back and take in the sights by taking a tram through town, or hop on a river cruise to see the old harbor and small neighboring villages. Finish your sightseeing with a German beer and bratwurst!  Less than 50 miles from Rostock, the historic town of Stralsund on northern Germany’s Baltic Coast is a UNESCO World Heritage Site thanks to its medieval origins. (The town dates back to the mid-13th century!) Like nearby Lübeck and Rostock, Stralsund is known for Gothic red brick architecture; the seven-spired town hall and elaborate St. Mary’s Church are two of the best examples.  The old-world flare in Stralsund is unbeatable, and a visitor could easily spend an afternoon exploring the waterfront and strolling the streets lined with colorful shuttered houses. If you notice a building that does not fit in with its surroundings (its curved white facade screams modernity amongst a sea of weathered Gothic brick), it’s the Ozeaneum, a huge aquarium of Baltic fish! Another quirky Stralsund attraction is the playing card factory — playing cards have been manufactured here since the mid-18th century. Before you leave, climb to the top of St. Mary’s steeple for views across the city and sea.  Germany’s largest island, Rügen Island, sits off the country’s northeastern coast. Here, you’ll find Binz, an old fishing town turned seaside resort. White villas are scattered all around the island, but their Victorian flair is what makes Binz different from your normal beach town.  In some ways, Binz resembles Coronado Island in San Diego, especially thanks to its massive beachfront hotel pictured above. While in Binz, stroll the oceanfront Strandpromenade, lounge in a beach chair on the white sand, shop around downtown, and grab a bite to eat at a table outside one of the restaurants. Walk along the pier at sunset, and then do it all over again the next day!  Nuremberg, a name which you likely recognize from the Nuremberg Trials, the post-World War II military prosecutions sentencing Nazi leaders for their war crimes and crimes against humanity, is located in Germany’s Bavaria. Today, Nuremberg is a charming fairytale-like city which is home to the Kaiserburg castle. Visitors can take advantage of its Sinwell Tower for views of the whole city.  The Germanisches Nationalmuseum (Germanic National Museum) contains more than 20,000 exhibits on the culture of the German-speaking world, while the St. Sebaldus and St. Lorenz Churches, which date back to the 13th century, are worth marveling at. Something you won’t see anywhere else is Nuremberg’s over 60-foot Gothic fountain from the 14th century, Schöner Brunnen. Nuremberg even has its own special kind of bratwurst (Nürnberger Bratwurst) that is only produced in the city! The capital of the German state of Bavaria, historic Munich, contrasts the modernity of Berlin and is best known for — you guessed it — Oktoberfest. As the home of this world-famous beer festival, Munich is full of biergartens, including the famous Hofbräuhaus dating back to the 16th century.  The city also displays intricate architecture of all different styles: the Neo-Gothic town hall at Marienplatz (Munich’s central square) is famous for its elaborate Glockenspiel clock, complete with dancing characters which pop out every so often, while the two Gothic towers of the Frauenkirche (a church) are visible high over Munich’s rooftops. Other things to explore in the city include the lush English Garden (a city park which is even larger than NYC’s Central Park), St. Peter’s Church where you can climb to the top of the tower for amazing views of the city, and the sprawling Nymphenburg Palace – the summer estate of the old Bavarian monarchs.  The Bavarian Alps stretch for more than 200 miles along the German-Austrian border. The towering mountains are breathtaking and the many mountain towns nestled among them look like something out of a picture book. Zugspitze, Germany’s highest mountain peak, reaches a height of nearly 10,000 feet.  One of the best mountain towns to visit is Garmisch-Partenkirchen, which actually used to be two towns that united to host the 1936 Winter Olympics. Today, it is a hub for both skiing in the Alps and a charming taste of old Bavaria. While there, visit Eibsee Lake, which sits about 5 miles south of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The scenery of the gorgeous blue water against the massive mountains is unbeatable. In the region, picturesque Füssen lies near two castles, Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau; beautiful Lake Walchensee remains largely un-touristed; and Berchtesgaden is home to a national park and a mountaintop restaurant with panoramic views (which, interestingly, was built as a birthday gift to Hitler in 1939).  With any of these, you can’t go wrong! Like Munich, many towns have beer halls where locals eat, drink, and socialize, which makes up an important part of Bavarian culture. No matter which town you choose as your home base, be sure take a cable car up one of the mountains for jaw-dropping views of the whole region.  Lake Constance in the south of Germany is split between the regions of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, with countless picturesque towns scattered along its shores. One of these towns, Lindau, sits on the eastern Bavarian side of the lake and is made up of both an island in the lake and a mainland.  As a whole, Lindau is a great spot for outdoor adventure and water sports, as well as history and German culture. Medieval cobblestone streets, elaborate lakefront villas, charming gabled buildings, and stunning views of the mountains across the lake are sure to make Lindau a crowd-pleaser. Historic sights include the colorful Thieves Tower, frescoes at the Church of St. Peter, the 12th-century Mangturm Tower, and the grand Old Town Hall.  To me, this is Germany’s most charming town, with architecture of the ‘olden days’ and a town square that looks straight out of a fairytale book. I love it so much, I’ve returned in each season to see it.  This university town also plays host to one of the best Christmas markets in Germany, the chocolART festival where you can get chocolate in nearly every imaginable form for 5 days each. Read more here.  In western Germany, Cologne is considered a cultural hub with high Gothic architecture and Rhine river setting. It’s Germany’s fourth most populous city and boasts one of the country’s most beautiful cathedrals, the Kölner Dom.  For those seeking the medieval architecture that parts of Europe are so well known for, Cologne delivers. Unlike much of Germany, which was hastily rebuilt following the Second World War, Cologne retained much of its architecture. This is also a great city for those who love shopping, and if you’re a festival lover, the Cologne Carnival is one of the largest street fairs in Europe. Though there are many other lovely German cities, like Heidelberg, Leipzig, Dresden, Freiburg, and countless others, the ones on this list each have something unique about them that I think you’ll love.  I hope you come to enjoy Germany as much as I do!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-best-things-to-do-in-berlin-in-the-summer/,The Best Things to Do in Berlin in the Summer,Germany,"Berlin undergoes one of the biggest transformations of any city I know as the seasons change. In the winter it feels like Gotham City to me, always dark and a little bit gloomy, but in the summertime it blooms like a flower. The parks are full of people sunning themselves and picnicking, the energy starts buzzing like a swarm of happy bumblebees, and there’s nowhere better to be than outside. I based myself in Berlin for nearly 5 years, always sure to give myself a good chunk of summer in the city. The following are some better-known options along with some very local suggestions for the best things to do in the summer in Berlin:  I used to live directly on one of the canals in Berlin precisely because my favorite summertime activity was sitting on the edge, my legs dangling over while the swans swam by, eating cherries and listening as my friends strummed guitar. There are several canals running through the city, but the biggest grassy area is near Admiralbrücke in Kreuzberg. You’ll find a mix of locals and tourists there speaking all kinds of languages while they drink beverages from the nearby Späti (corner store). It’s a free activity that I love. (FYI, the photo above is from Bethaniendamm, a different bridge in the city that isn’t a great hangout spot, but I must’ve been in the moment so much each time at Admiralbrücke, because I don’t have any photos from there!) One of the things that makes Berlin so Berlin is the fierce protection of public space. Tempelhof is a former airport that stopped running flights in 2008, and though a series of apartment buildings were slated to go in, the locals pushed back so hard that they won and now it’s one of the largest public parks in Europe. It’s open year-round, but summertime is when you’ll see people using the public space as a garden, for windsurfing along the tarmac, and barbecuing. You can also take tours through the old airport and find that it’s largely unchanged. It’s kind of creepy and interesting at the same time. You can read more here. More of a local suggestion, this used to be my favorite hangout spot in the summer – but you’ve got to know where to go to find it. It’s located on the top of the Neukölln Arcaden, and you’ll need to take the elevator to the 5th floor and out to your left up the parking lot ramp to get to it. If you start seeing funky decorations you’re on the right track. There’s almost always live music, tons of art that is ever-changing, a funky garden, and even a sandbox. It’s the perfect daytime hangout when the weather is nice, and don’t forget to stay for sunset for an amazing view over the city. Entrance is €3-6 (depends on the act that night, and the garden area is free) and the drinks are reasonable. Badeschiff is a floating swimming pool on the river Spree that is touristy but also can be fun. Berlin can get boiling hot at times, and there’s a dearth of AC units and places to cool off, so sometimes the only thing you can do is go for a swim. If you’re not keen to leave the city for a nearby lake, then Badeschiff is a nice option. Entrance is 5.50€ and it’s located right on the Spree. Berlin is the best city in the world for a street art walking tour because there is such a rich counterculture history that is so beautifully illustrated by the art. It’s a great way to get a lay of the land while also learning about the unique story of the city. To me, nothing can give you a better sense of what Berlin is all about. You have a wide range of options for the walking tours. Some are free and others cost money, but it all evens out because the free ones expect a donation and €15 is appropriate, which is about the same price as a paid one. This is the one that I did and I thought it was so great, I suggest it to everyone who visits. Teufelsberg, or Devil’s Mountain, is another one of my favorites and a spot that I suggest to absolutely everyone who visits Berlin. It is the hands-down coolest place for street art enthusiasts. A former spy station, now this urban space plays host to the most famous and talented street artists in the world. Their work is thought-provoking, skilled, and there is so much of it that you can spend hours there. Ownership keeps changing hands but usually you do have to pay entrance and take a tour to see it. You can read more here. This spa and sauna is one of my favorite things to do in Berlin, both in the winter and in the summer. Now that I have moved out, I really miss it! Vabali is a naked coed spa. You’re not even allowed to wear a bathing suit! At first I found this scary, but now I think it’s very healthy to be in an environment where everyone is naked and it’s not at all sexual. I find it very freeing. It’s also quite a classy place with five different swimming pools and 10 different saunas of varying temperatures. This is the perfect rainy summer Berlin activity – and it does rain a lot. Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg, which is brimming with lakes. Most of them you would need a car to get to, which you can rent off of Europaplatz if you’re keen, or you can get to Krumme Lanke and Wiesser See by public transportation. The former is not very touristy and it has nice, clear water and a nude beach option, which is pretty common in Eastern Germany. The latter is a bit more touristy and accessible and has a five euro entrance fee as well as sunbeds, boat rentals, and food available. However there are literally hundreds of lakes to choose from in the area and my best suggestion is to ask a local, if you know any, what their favorite is. Otherwise, take a drive until you find one that you like! The city of Berlin is surrounded by forests and is actually located in quite a rural part of Germany. It doesn’t take long until you’re out of the city and surrounded by greenery. One of the most beautiful places for some nature is Spreewald, where you can rent a canoe or kayak and take yourself through the rural backwaters of Germany’s former East. How far you go is up to you, but make sure that you remember the way back! You can read more about how to get there here. A much-beloved Sunday activity, the Bearpit Karaoke at Mauerpark, the biggest flea market in the city, is one of the most supportive and lively spots in the city. The flea market itself is a bit touristy and overpriced, but the karaoke is free and if the weather is fine, it’s an awesome summertime activity. If you love pop-up restaurants and want a local feel, head to Bite Club, which takes place on the Spree on Fridays. There’s often music, artisanal burgers, beverages of course, and a lot of fusion foods available. Find info here. I could dedicate an entire blog post just to the nightlife in Berlin, but these are a few of my favorites: Club der Visionäre: Just a stone’s throw from my old apartment, this floating bar on the Spree is a great place for sundowners. Berghain: This infamous club that you almost have to pretend you don’t want to get into, even though you do, is rumored to be the toughest to get into in the world. My tips are to wear black, dress down, and go at around eight in the morning on Sunday and dance all day. I find it so much more fun that way, and there’s almost no queue! Kater Blau: Check the DJ Lineup because when the music is good this place is a somewhat small and intimate but thumping party. I’ll never forget dancing to Acid Pauli for two hours straight in the middle of the dance floor, with such a nice vibe around me. I was buzzing by the end despite being totally sober. Ecstatic Dance: Unfortunately, all of the aforementioned places are very smoky and most people there are drinking and/or drugging. However if you would like to be surrounded by a different vibe, I highly recommend Ecstatic Dance on Thursday nights and Sunday mornings. It’s a sober and silent dance party where you’re encouraged to dance however you want and whatever you feel. I find it’s very playful and my favorite kind of nightlife these days. Ecstatic Dance events are all over the world but Berlin’s is something special. Find the lineup here. Finally, you’ll notice that in the summertime, many of the Spätis put out tables and chairs and people use it as a makeshift bar and hangout spot. If a soccer game is on, they’ll often put out a TV as well for people to watch. I haven’t seen this in other cities around the world and consider it a true Berlin experience. This list is full of all of the things that make Berlin so special and unique. Berlin does also have museums, a cathedral, and a lot of the usual things that you will find in Europe (you can read more about those here, along with great places to eat), but if you really want to get a true taste, the things on this list will give you a real Berlin experience. Enjoy your time in Berlin, there’s nowhere in the world like it! Great post! I’d love to go back to Berlin again one day! beautiful article thanks for sharing. Hey Kristin, great timing on this article. Your writing made it sound like you don’t live in Berlin anymore, is that true? If so, where are you based now? Yes I moved away! I am still floating around figuring that out 🙂 Hey Kristin, thanks for replying. You’re such a wanderer, I love it! Did you sell your apartment too (the one from the video)? I’m missing on this list Clärchens Ballhaus, not-so-hidden gem 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-german-christmas-markets/,14 of the Best German Christmas Markets,Germany,"During the first two years of my travels, I’d been largely Christmas-free. I was in Thailand the first year for the holidays and following that, in the Philippines, but in a slightly remote area without any organized celebrations. That was just fine with me, as I had started to get a bit jaded about the buy-buy-buy nature of the holidays and had started to be more team Grinch than team Santa. Then I moved to Germany. Something about the cultural experience with the delicious food and beautiful lights totally flipped my approach to Christmas, and I feel in love again. I’ve traveled all around Germany’s Christmas markets from small towns to big ones, from medieval-style markets to modern ones selling modern wares. Somewhere between the kinderpunsch and gingerbread, I started to love Christmas again. At this point, I’ve been to about 30 markets, and these are the best ones: Bad Wimpfen is almost too cute for words. The town itself is adorable with the exposed beam buildings and quaint decorations reminiscent of the olden days, and the market makes it light up even more. As you wander up and up through the cobblestone streets, meandering down into courtyards, it seems like the entire old town is in on this Christmas market. They had live music, handmade wares in decorated stands against the backdrop of the old church and decorated buildings, and lots of sweets for sale. Though still popular, this was slightly less crowded than some of the other markets. This one is my personal favorite (so far). How to get there: It’s a 2-minute walk from Bad Wimpfen train stationWhen: Friday – Sunday from November 30 – December 16 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free You guys, Tübingen’s Christmas market is all about chocolate! The chocolART Christmas market is Europe’s largest chocolate market and boy does it deliver! Stands sell chocolate in every form imaginable – hot chocolate, spicy chocolate, vegan chocolate (yay!), chocolate cake, chocolate spread, chocolate covered fruit, and chocolate booze. If it exists in chocolate form, you can find it at chocolART. This is a popular market, so I highly recommend getting there early and staying until the lights come on at night in the town square, projecting designs onto each of the adorable buildings. I adore this little town at any time of year but at Christmas it becomes a chocolate delight! How to get there: It’s a 10-minute walk from Tübingen HbfWhen: December 3 – December 8 (specific opening hours here) Cost: Free There are so many reasons to visit Heidelberg – the castle, the Philosopher’s Way, the adorable old town, and even the university.  In the winter time, they’ve even got several Christmas markets! My favorite is in Heidelberg’s old town, which is already famous for how picturesque it is, so just imagine it covered in lights! I recommend getting there while it is still light out and hiking up to the castle for sunset and then walking down into the market. This one goes for several blocks and has different pockets to explore. At night, the buildings have colorful lights projected onto them as well. How to get there: Take the train or no 33 bus from Heidelberg hbf to Heidelberg-Altstadt stationWhen:November 26 – December 22 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free Hattingen is the first Christmas market I ever visited. It was also the smallest, but what I loved about it was the traditions kept alive throughout the town. Each hour, a woman dressed as Frau Holle shakes out a pillow case which is meant to symbolize snow falling. It did result in a bunch of feathers stuck in the cracks of the cobblestone sidewalk, but the kids around town sure loved it! What I found particularly appealing was the friendliness of the locals, including the operator of the merry-go-round who humored me and my giant Hungarian friend by letting us take a ride around. It was also my first taste of Gluhwein (mulled wine) which was served in a little boot. How could that not leave a lasting impression? How to get there: Take the train to Hattingen train stationWhen: Thursday – Sunday from November 26 – December 23 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free Essen’s light display is what I’ll remember most about the Christmas market. Compared to others, there was much more room to walk around and enjoy the sights without constantly bumping into someone else or pushing through narrow walkways. Though it took place in an outdoor shopping mall, which took away from the magic a bit, it’s a trade-off for me because it’s a bit less crowded and claustrophobic. I also highly recommend checking out the Zeche Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex nearby. It’s a converted coal mine that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It doesn’t sound exciting but it’s quite interesting to take a look inside, and they have an ice skating rink for Christmas! You can read more about that on the best things to do in Germany in the winter.  How to get there: Take the train to Essen main railway stationWhen: Thursday – Sunday from November 15 – December 23 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free This market was quirky and quite different from all the rest. In what was the smallest town visited on this trip, this particular market has a medieval theme – and they keep to it! Everything from juggling performers, harpsichord players and fortune tellers were about, all dressed to the theme. It felt a bit like a Christmas-themed renaissance fair, with whole pigs roasting over spit-fires, mulled wine served in clay mugs, and hollowed out cow horns and flower garlands for sale. As a kid, I would have loved this place to pieces, and as an adult, I still had a profound appreciation for it. Apparently at night, the market is decorated with candles. Out of all the markets, this one keeps to the medieval theme the most. How to get there: It’s a 5-minute walk from Siegburg train stationWhen: Thursday – Sunday from November 23 – December 22 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free Given it’s a big city with lots of famous markets, prepare for crowds in Cologne. That said, the biggest and best Christmas tree I saw, framed by the beautiful Kölner Dom (Cologne Cathedral), made for such an impressive sight that this one sticks out in my mind the most. Plenty of markets are within walking distance of each other in Cologne, making it an easy place to do some Christmas market hopping. Some are chocolate themed, some are elf-themed, and some are a bit more modern, selling practical Christmas gifts and beautiful ornaments, though you can expect to pay a price premium on such things. How to get there: Cologne Cathedral – Roncalliplatz next to Cologne Cathedral; Cologne’s Old Town – Between the Heumarkt and the Alter Market in the old town; The Angel’s Market – In the Neumarkt close to the city centreWhen: November 24 – December 23 (check the specific dates and opening hours of each of the markets here)Cost: Free Famous for gingerbread, Aachen is one of my favorite Christmas markets, not to mention towns in general. The market is famous for having the best gingerbread in all of Germany – at least that’s what they say. I thought it was full of really good food, too.  What really blew me away was the cathedral in town, covered in golden mosaics and impossibly high and intricate stained glass windows. It took my breath away and made me dizzy from constantly looking up, jaw gaping open from the beauty above me. I also absolutely loved the cathedral. Definitely take a look inside if you’ll be visiting the Aachen Christmas market. The mosaic ceiling is gorgeous, and the stained glass windows are impressive as well. This is a market I’d bring my family back to. It was lovely. How to get there: Take the train to Aachen train stationWhen: Daily from 11AM – 9PM from November 23 – December 23Cost: Free Nestled in the Black Forest, this Christmas market is located underneath a gorgeous archway bridge that lights up in rainbow colors, changing every 10 minutes or so. There’s a brook running behind the market as well, decorated with a nativity scene. This one is small and intimate, and also popular, but super magical. The booths at this market have some of the more unique items for sale that I’ve seen, including sculptures, a conversation with St. Nicholas, and Christmas wraps in tortillas. I didn’t expect that at what appeared to be such a traditional market from first impressions. Be sure to climb up the hill above the market to get the view pictured above, and watch as the train runs by every 10 minutes or so. How to get there: Take the free buses from Himmelreich or Hinterzarten stationWhen: Friday – Sunday from November 30 – December 23 (specific opening hours here)Cost:3€ on Fridays or 4€ on Saturdays and Sundays I truly feel that, amid stiff competition, Hohenzollern is the fairest castle in all the land. It’s beautiful from afar, and you should see it (here’s how) but it’s beautiful up close at Christmas time as well when they host the King’s market. The castle is closed for the market on the inside, so plan on spending the entirety of your market experience in the courtyard, which reminds me a bit of Hogwarts. You’ll see stalls with roasted chestnuts, handmade items like carved wooden St. Nick dolls and teddy bears, and ornaments. This is a market that kids will love thanks to the bubble man and a dressed up Saint Nicholas with elves. Though it’s the most expensive one on the list, this market is worth checking out, especially since it’s one of the only ones that takes place in a castle! How to get there: Self drive, or take the shuttle bus from Hechingen train stationWhen: Thursday – Saturday from November 29 – December 8 (specific opening hours here)Cost: 10€ This is by far the largest medieval market I’ve ever been to! If you’re like me when I was a kid, obsessed with princesses, going to Medieval Times for my birthday, and loving the Renaissance fair, you’ll love the sheer size and variety of this one. They had an entire area with old-school games like archery and axe throwing, and food and drink that was inspired by the times as well, including vegan bread and curry (okay maybe the curry was a bit out of place). These are the perfect markets to buy handmade wooden items, or leather and fur if you’re into it. The medieval market in Esslingen must be one of the biggest ones in Germany. It’s certainly the largest medieval Christmas market I’ve ever been to, and I loved the variety. Getting there: It’s a 5-minute walk up Berliner Str from Esslingen train stationWhen: November 27 – December 21 (specific opening hours here)Cost: Free If you love beautiful Christmas lights then you’ll love the baroque market in Ludwigsburg, just 20 minutes north of Stuttgart. The town lights up with golden wings and in the main market square, four golden angels fly over the Christmas market facing in each direction. This was one of the most beautiful markets I visited and it’s quite convenient to reach as well. There’s a merry-go-round for kids, lots of stalls with lights, knits, ornaments, and of course mulled wine and food. It’s only about 15 minutes from Stuttgart, so be sure to stop by. Getting there: It’s a 10-minutes walk from Ludwigsburg station. Golden wings will light your wayWhen: November 27 – December 23 (More info here)Cost: Free This little town is probably not on the radar of very many (if any?) tourists. It’s a tiny market but what struck me was how incredibly proud the locals are of their heritage. It’s a former mining town with a little tour of the mines put on by local volunteers. What made it stand out for me was the procession called the Mettenschicht – a name given to the last shift worked before Christmas. Town locals dressed up in olden-style clothing and marched up a tall, spinning, circular structure that stood at the end of the Miner’s wintermarkt. Then they proceeded to the old church and closed with a speech and feast. I also couldn’t believe how sweet the locals were. They were incredibly welcoming, offering us free drinks! If you went here without speaking with the locals and/or attending the ceremony, you might wonder why I listed this one, but thanks to how willing they were to involve foreigners, I was touched and this one really stands out. How to get there: Drive. Here’s the exact locationWhen: 3PM – 7PM from December 15 – December 16Cost: Free Located at the Schlossplatz stop on the U-bahn, Stuttgart’s main Christmas market is known for all of its dazzling lights. There’s a giant Christmas tree, an ice skating rink, blocks of stalls with lightup stars, ginger bread, and food and drink, and even a light up Porsche and Mercedes. Cost: FreeGetting there: Schlossplatz is the closest station.When: Daily from November 28 – December 23 (specific opening hours here) What are some of your favorite Christmas markets around the world, or in Germany? Let me know in the comments! Let’s hit up some markets when you’re back in town!! I’m only here for today then leaving to California! Will mostly miss them this year 🙁 This post makes me feel bad. I live in Germany and have never heard of Düppenweiler nor have I ever thought about exploring other christmas markets other than those of my hometown. Speaking of Hamburg, we have a “naughty” market right on the Reeperbahn, the “Santa Pauli christmas market”. It comes with a lot if “adult” stuff (a strip tent for instance…) but is definitely worth checking out simply because it’s both traditional and new. It’s my favorite and a good starting point for nightlife adventures.Great post and photos as always! 🙂 OMG i have to check that out! And don’t feel bad. I grew up in California but I’ve never been to the Grand Canyon. We tend to explore the ends of the earth before our own backyards, don’t we? I just came back from Hamburg last weekend and it was awesome ! Christmas markets everywhere ! Delicious things to eat everywhere ! And the city is really cool too. I think Germany is the boss when it comes to Christmas market ! Hamburg is pretty cool! I do want to check out the xmas fair in Budapest too. The lights display in Essen is so pretty! In fact, everything is so gorgeous. Be it the ornaments or Christmas tree, colorful markets or roads with garlands, everything looks magical. And when pigs fly! Haha! So cute! Keep posting such captivating pictures! Will do! And agreed, it’s so pretty you can almost appreciate the cold 😉 I love Tubingen! I bet I’d love that market too. Thanks for telling me about it! I’ve been to Oslo Christmas Market and it was so amazing. I felt Christmas atmosphere right away ;). I’ve never been to any of German ones, but I see that I definately should go!  Hugs <3 They’re awesome! So much good food and of course mulled wine. Yeah the food and drink is definitely overpriced but it’s so fun to go for a night or two. I never experienced Christmas markets before last year so it was pretty cool for me! Germany looks so magical during Christmas time!I also wanted to add that I LOVE the new layout of your site! Thank you so much! Redesigned it based on feedback from the reader survey and just really wanted to make it more user-friendly and I’m glad to see that it’s working! Living in Europe opened up the entire Christmas market extravaganza to me a couple years back. Germany is obviously amazing, but I also enjoyed Vienna (holy hell, gorgeous), and London’s markets at least try their best to compete. I love some of the smaller cities you’ve featured – it really is a community effort in many places, which I’m sure you felt! Yes it’s so cool when you can tell the community comes together to put on the Christmas market and really takes pride in guests coming to visit. I haven’t seen Christmas markets in any other countries but I’ve heard great things. German Christmas markets definitely are the best! I love the glimpses of some of the smaller ones – you’re right that I haven’t heard of many of them! I went to the markets in Cologne this year and really loved them! I didn’t venture back out at night, though, which I kind of regret now after seeing that photo of the cathedral market all lit up at night! Wow! I love them at night but they do get very crowded – that one in particular! Ah, Mulled wine! Love it. Germany looks like a pretty fun place to celebrate Christmas in! And those blue mosaics…wow. I just went to seven Christmas markets myself, and the only one that overlapped with yours was Cologne, which definitely had the most attractive ones. Aachen looks amazing! I’d also recommend Heidelberg and Stuttgart. I’m a bit biased but I honestly think Cologne’s Christmas markets are second to none – the LGBT Christmas Market on the famous Schaafenstrasse was the best yet this last year. Definitely worth checking out. Excellent article & YouTube video. Is there a way to find out if any markets are open Christmas Eve? Website perhaps? The longest running market in your post is 12/23. Traveling from the states & hoping I can make it in time to experience a German Christmas market! I’m guessing they close by then because that’s a pretty significant day in Germany that’s meant to be shared with family.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-christmas-markets-near-stuttgart-germany/,"The Best Christmas Markets Near Stuttgart, Germany",Germany,"I admit, prior to making Germany my adopted home, I was pretty over Christmas. It felt to me like I was always indirectly buying myself a bunch of things that would live in the bottom of my closet for no reason. Then I went to a Christmas market and my cold, Grinch heart grew by three sizes. I saw dazzling lights, I saw steaming cups of joy (mulled wine back then, now I love the kiddie punch), I saw mountains of chocolate and handmade wares. I was delighted! I was charmed. Christmas markets are not the kitschy fake Christmas cheer I feared they would be. They serve great food, each has its own unique theme, and they are a true cultural experience. Believe me, I would be the first one to dismiss them otherwise, but I love them! In particular, I love the fairytale feel of the ones in Baden-Württemberg, home to the Black Forest, picturesque little towns, and the most amazing castles in Germany.  After much exploration, these are my favorite Christmas markets down south in Germany, each reachable by day trip from Stuttgart: I’ve probably been to about 30 Christmas markets now, and Bad Wimpfen has to be my favorite. The town itself is adorable with the exposed beam buildings and quaint decorations reminiscent of the olden days. As you wander up and up through the cobblestone streets, meandering down into courtyards, it seems like the entire old town is in on this Christmas market. It felt like it kept going and going, with new pockets to explore full of beautiful lights, delicious food, live music from a brass band, and lots of handmade ornaments and cookie cutters for sale, among other things. Though still popular, this was slightly less crowded than some of the other markets. I highly recommend this one. Cost: FreeGetting there: Located about an hour and 20 minutes north of Stuttgart, take the S-bahn until Bad Wimpfen and walk for 2 minutes to get to the market.When: Most weekends from the end of November until the middle of December. Check the tourism board website here. Brace yourselves and don your stretchiest pair of pants because Tübingen’s Christmas market is all about chocolate! The chocolART Christmas market has chocolate in every form imaginable – hot chocolate, spicy chocolate, vegan chocolate (yay!), chocolate cake, chocolate spread, chocolate covered fruit, and chocolate booze. If you can imagine it, you can find it at chocolART. This is a popular market, so I highly recommend getting there early and staying until the lights come on at night in the town square, projecting designs onto each of the adorable buildings. I adore this little town at any time of year but at Christmas it really comes alive! Cost: FreeGetting there: Take the train to Tübingen Hbf then walk about 10 minutes across the bridge and to your left to get to the market.When: Typically the week leading into the second weekend of December. More info here. There are so many reasons to visit Heidelberg – the castle, the Philosopher’s Way, and in the wintertime, the Christmas markets! Heidelberg’s old town is already famous for how picturesque it is, so just imagine it covered in lights! I recommend getting there while it is still light out and hiking up to the castle for sunset and then walking down into the market. Be sure to check out the ice rink, the building is lit up at night, and prepare to hang onto the little mug from this market – it’s adorable. Cost: FreeGetting there: If you arrive at the Heidelberg Hbf, take the number 33 bus to Altstadt. Depending on how you get there, you can also get off at the altstadt stop on the S-bahn train.When: Usually every day from the end of November until December 22. More here. Nestled in the Black Forest, this Christmas market is located underneath a gorgeous archway bridge, which lights up from blue to purple, pink, red, gold, and green. As if that wasn’t magical enough, a brook runs behind the market that is also lit up for Christmas. The booths at this market have modern artwares for sale as well as some inventive foods, like a ‘Christmas wrap’ with cheese and salsa wrapped in a tortilla. Or the dessert version which is hazelnut chocolate wrapped in a tortilla. It sounds wrong but it’s a popular booth! Be sure to climb up the hill above the market to get the view pictured above, and watch as the train runs by every 10 minutes or so. Cost: 3€ on Fridays or 4€ on Saturdays and Sundays.Getting there: Take the train to Himmelreich or Hinterzarten. From there the market provides free buses that seemed to be running constantly.When: Friday, Saturday and Sunday almost every weekend in December. Click here to look at the website, which is in German but dates are universal. It’s no big secret if you’ve seen my other writing that this is my favorite castle. I truly feel it’s the fairest in all the land. It’s beautiful from afar, and you should see it (here’s how) but it’s beautiful up close at Christmas time as well when they host the King’s market. The market takes place almost entirely outside, so don’t plan on spending much time in the castle. Instead plan on stalls with roasted chestnuts, cute handmade items like carved wooden St. Nick dolls and teddy bears, and a market that kids will love thanks to the bubble man and a dressed up Saint Nicholas with elves. Though it’s the most expensive one on the list, this market is worth checking out, especially since it’s one of the only ones that takes place in a castle! Cost: 10€Getting there: I have only ever driven a car to Hohenzollern since it seems the only way I’m aware of to get to the viewpoint. However there are shuttle buses running from the Hechingen train station for the Christmas market.When: The first and second weekends of December. More info here. When I was a kid, I was obsessed with princesses, went to Medieval Times for my birthday, and loved the Renaissance fair. So when I found out that they had medieval markets in Germany I was like wow, they really checked all the boxes with this one! I love these markets because they often keep to the theme pretty well, with old-school games like archery and axe throwing and food and drink that is inspired by the times as well. These are the perfect markets to buy handmade wooden items, or leather if you’re into it. The medieval market in Esslingen must be one of the biggest ones in Germany. It’s certainly the largest medieval Christmas market I’ve ever been to, and I love the variety. Cost: FreeGetting there: Get off at the Esslingen Hbf and walk up Berliner Str. for about five minutes and you’ll start to see the market.When: From the end of November until Dec 21. More info here. If you love dazzling lights then you’ll love the baroque market in Ludwigsburg, just 20 minutes north of Stuttgart. The town lights up with golden wings guiding your way from the station to the main market square, where four golden angels fly over the Christmas market. This was one of the most beautiful markets I visited thanks to all of the golden lights. There’s a merry-go-round for kids, lots of stalls with lights, knits, ornaments, and of course mulled wine and food. This one is worth stopping by on your way home from Bad Wimpfen, or as the destination itself. Cost: FreeGetting there: Take the S-bahn to Ludwigsburg Hbf and walk for about 10 minutes to the market square. Golden wings will light your way.When: Daily from the end of November until December 23. More info here.  We can’t talk about Stuttgart Christmas markets without talking about the big one in Stuttgart itself! Located at the Schlossplatz stop on the U-bahn, Stuttgart’s main Christmas market is known for all of its dazzling lights. There’s a giant Christmas tree, an ice skating rink, blocks of stalls with lightup stars, gingerbread, and food and drink, and even a light up Porsche and Mercedes. Cost: FreeGetting there: Schlossplatz is the closest station.When: Daily from the end of November to the end of December. More info here. While there are hundreds of Christmas markets to choose from, these are a few of my favorites, particularly in amazing Baden-Württemberg, which has the best Christmas markets in Germany, IMHO. I’m sad to be leaving this wonderful country (you can read more about that here) but am so glad that I got a chance to explore these markets before taking off. This will always be my favorite place to celebrate Christmas. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Tourismus Baden-Württemberg. All thoughts on these amazing markets and how much I love Baden-Württemberg are as always, my own.  Great info ,good thanks .

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-pack-carry-on-luggage-in-winter/,How to Pack Carry-On Only in the Winter (And Still Look Fabulous),Germany,"Imagine this: You score an amazing deal on a flight to a snowy destination. You can almost imagine the snowflakes falling on your tongue and the hot chocolate warming your hands. To be honest, part of the fun is figuring out which cute winter coats and scarves are going to accompany you on the trip, until the crushing realization that that great deal isn’t so great anymore after all of the checked bag fees, time waiting at baggage claim, and the annoyance of dragging suitcases over cobblestone. Don’t give up your winter wonderland dreams just yet, you can still look fab and pack carry on only luggage in the winter. I’ve got the full system here.  It’s all possible with one simple tactic: layering. What’s in my bag:  All of these things can fit into a carry on sized backpack, even though at first it might not seem like it. This is how I do it: I typically wear my snow boots, winter coat, and biggest scarf on the flight. I can almost always stuff the coat into the overhead bin, or use it on the freezing cold flight as a blanket or pillow. It’s usually been much better to have it with me than to have it packed for this reason. When it comes to jackets, I suggest bringing the one that most suits the weather you’re likely to encounter. If I know I’m going to be in temperatures well below freezing, I tend to bring along my puffy red jacket. It has kept me warm in -30 F previously.  However on my recent trip to the Christmas markets, the temperatures were mostly just around freezing or above, so I stuck to my more stylish wool coat and layered sweaters underneath. The same goes for leggings. If I know it’s going to be particularly cold, I wear ski underwear with a snow pants shell over, but if I can get away with layering more stylish pairs of leggings or even yoga pants, I do that instead. Here’s a video that walks you through the process in more detail:  As you can see from the video, the biggest key is to have a packing cube, which allows you to roll and stuff your clothing in side by side. I’ve been using the same one for years now and swear by it. I even devoted an entire post to why I love it so much here. While everyone else struggles with heavy bags, I love the ease of walking around with my light bag, skipping baggage claim, having no worries that my bag might get lost by the airline, and easily taking public transportation rather than missing the fun of people-watching in a cab. It’s just about creatively layering and alternating, washing clothing regularly, and being choosey about what you bring and what you leave at home. As you can see, it’s still possible to travel carry-on only in the winter. Give it a try, and let me know in the comments how it works out for you! I hope this helped you to travel lighter. Happy travels! READ NEXT: Love this! I never thought carry-on only would be possible in the winter… Then again, I’m in love with gigantic wool sweaters, which don’t exactly condense that easily. Great tips though, will keep this in mind for my winter journeys! 😀 That video was so helpful. I’m heading out on a 4 month trip to Europe and really didn’t want to take anything other than my carry on bag. Time to invest in packing cubes tho!! Packing cubes are the real secret! Hi there! I’m from Chicago by way of Manila, and I’ve been reading this blog for a while. Really cool entries! I recently went backpacking across Europe for 2 weeks with just carry on. Went to Spain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, with just a travel backpack containing a week’s worth of clothes, a camera, and a laptop this past December. I also spent 2 weeks in Denmark, Norway and Sweden in the winter of 2013, also with just a travel backpack. It’s so much easier to get around, less space to occupy in public transit and less worry about losing luggage. Having a parka or any other jacket with extra pockets helps too. Learning how to do laundry in France and Norway were really trippy experiences. Berlin is amazing in the wintertime! Went there in 2012 and had a blast! The Tiergarten looks more otherwordly when it’s covered in snow. Cheers! Completely agree and awesome that you’ve tried it too and it worked out! Quite the opposite. Most charge you to check a bag. It would only be a waste of money if you paid for baggage and then didn’t check any. Incredible! I’m the worst at packing. Too much gear! Maybe I’ll start wearing leggings 😛 They’re so slimming! I hate it too which is why I like it simplified. If I have fewer things the chances of losing something are smaller 🙂 I love the idea of traveling carry-on only, but most airlines have a limit for the amount of bags that you’re allowed to bring as well as their size, right? Or maybe that’s just my point of view as a European who is used to low-cost airlines such as Ryanair 🙂 I wouldn’t mess with Ryan Air but every other airline has been fine with the 35L. I just have that one and a smaller bag that I keep my wallet, passport, and cameras in. My 35L has been fine on Ryanair! I don’t overpack it (have been traveling with just 3 outfits for the last month) and it fits weight and size requirements for them. Hi Kathleen:  Ryanair’s new policy as of November is if you are a non-priority flyer then you can only bring a tiny carry-on (really a “personal item”) which appears to be <25L. You are fine if priority customer but out of luck for a 35L if not. Don't know if you are a priority customer or what that requires, I will check that out. In an odd twist, they say this is a good thing because they allow larger personal items (?) which is not saying much and that checked bags are a little cheaper. For carry-on folks who fly non-priority that isn't very helpful :). They say it will reduce delays, not familiar with the planes they use, but other airlines seem to deal with it and allow 35L carry-on, hmm….:) Your awesome!Any cubes better than others? I use Eagle Creek and it has served me well for two years despite much overstuffing 🙂 This is very useful – thank you 🙂 I usually also pack an extra duffel, in case I do have luggage allowance or decide that I want to purchase check in luggage for those times I pick up good souvenirs, like wine from France ) Definitely a good idea if you’re not on an open-ended journey and know you’ll be returning home after a few weeks or months. Loving the new site. It’s awesome….it’s more emersive. Thanks that’s what I was hoping 🙂 I’ve never tried packing a carry-on with winter clothes…I have always been intimidated but you have given me courage! I was too but turns out it’s doable and i’m so glad that it is. Do you still travel with your packsafe? I didn’t have one when I was in Thailand, but I had an apartment in a non touristy part of town. I sure do. Still so useful. I have even more of their products now. Definitely swear by them. Hi Kristin, One month with that carry on? wow. I’m going to Europe for a week plus only (can i fit any stuffs into one carry on trolley luggage). What is i wish to but some souvenirs? May i know where to buy the compression bag (for bags and shoes) that you have in the video? I think i need to find ways to get some plastic compression bag to stuck my bulky sweater/ clothing .. I use these: http://amzn.to/1H1X2nA so cheap and SO useful!  I actually did a carry on for a full year in Southeast Asia, and again when I went to Africa for 3.5 months this year. It’s doable, but not if you want big souvenirs. You might have to mail those home. Haha, I love the video. I thought it was hilarious.  My first backpacking trip of three month around Europe started in august and ended in November. I went through three different climates (Spain and Italy were extremely hot, but Germany and Poland were cold by the time I got there). This meant I had to pack layers. Lots of layers. I used tank tops as skirt bottoms in the heat, and layered everything I had for Poland and Germany.  My problem is that I tend to be very attracted to hand-made items. I buy art from a lot of the countries I travel to. So… That’s where my packing becomes a problem.  Not only that, but my skin is so extremely sensitive that I have to use certain shampoos and conditioners and laundry detergents. If I don’t use the right stuff I break out in hives all over and it’s very itchy and uncomfortable. So, packing those things typically requires more than 3 oz. because it’s harder to find those products in certain places while traveling. You can usually find shampoo and conditioner of course, but finding stuff that won’t cause me hives. … curses… but, I’ve been working on packing lighter for the obvious benefits, so maybe i’ll jjust have to suffice with the 3oz bottles. I mean I do love the convenience but I can’t always do carry-on only. Lately I have brought a lot more gear and tech with me so it just needs more space. Great post! Finally a travel list for the winter. I will be heading to India for a month in a few days and will use this as a rough guide. Thank you!! No problem! I have just started reading your blog and I love it! Very inspiring and getting me very excited for my 2017 trip to SE Asia and beyond. How do you go about packing when you will be gone for an extended period of time, covering multiple climates? Also, I saw some of your pictures of winter mountain trekking where you are all decked out in ski jacket, snow pants, etc. Do you just rent that gear as needed? Thank you for all your helpful tips and advice! Recently you might have seen me in skiing attire in Austria and that’s a lot of clothing that’s just sensible for that particular sport so I had to kindly ask a friend to take a bunch of it and keep it at his place for me until I can pick it up. In SEA it’s mostly one climate type – hot and humid – so one small bag is totally cool. I rented or borrowed jackets on the rare occasion that I needed one. Otherwise I bought cheap and ditched things after that I didn’t need. Hey Kristin, Great post. How much did your backpack weigh since most airlines have a 7kg limit for carry ons? 🙂 A lot more, but I haven’t often been asked to weigh it. That’s always a possibility, though. This is absolutely amazing and helpful! I will be travelling to cold countries in a bit and thinking of downsizing my luggage. You made it look very possible now! Thank you Kristin for the post! Carry-on is the best! I’m trying to decide which coats to bring for my first time visiting the Christmas markets in Europe this December – it is so tough! I’ll be in Venice, Rome, Vienna, and Budapest, so there will be a range of temperatures (anticipating 50F and dry or rainy down to 0F and snowy). Finding the right boots is challenging too. Good thing I have a few months to prepare! I am hoping layers under my Karbon Trillium jacket will suffice. I don’t want to lug my big parka (Calvin Klein 600-wt down with fur-trimmed hood) for only the last week of the trip (but even more than that, I don’t want to freeze!). I’m resigned to bringing my 32″ suitcase (I brought it last time I went to Europe, and I was grateful for the space!). It’s all about the layering! Definitely prioritize comfort, though. It’s no fun being cold! I wanted a strong backpack, and this fits the bill. It’s sturdy, doesn’t rip easily, and definitely a great quality tactical backpack. It fits a lot of stuff, it doesn’t feel bloated, or too heavy. It’s a solid solution. Thank you for such an informative article. How many kilograms was your packed bag? I’m not entirely sure. Over the carry on limit but I usually don’t have an issue with it getting weighed. Hi Kristin, I’m going backpacking (for the first time!) starting in the South Caucuses and making my way West through Europe. I’m looking at getting the Aircontact 50L + 10 SL, by Deuter. Thanks to your tips I feel confident that I can pack light, so I’d really like to be able to go carry-on only and save myself the money and hassle of checking a bag. Because I’m so new to this I’m having a hard time gauging whether I can make that Deuter bag work as a carry-on. I know each airline has different rules, but if I don’t pack that 50L to the brim and compress the excess fabric at the top, do you think that it could qualify as a carry on? I think that it may wind up being bigger than I need for this 2 month trip, but I’m reluctant to downsize because that extra space may come in handy for future/longer term trips.  Any advice you can give would be much appreciated! Sadly that’s going to be too big. 35L is going to be the max, maaaayyybe 40, but most European airlines are pretty strict, and you’d have to go even smaller if you end up flying Ryan Air. LOVE this travel guide packing list. Will definitely bookmark, and I’m going to check out some of the products / clothes you suggested. What did you use for the product preview grid? Loved the ease of clicking through the products. Most flights from the US to Europe do include a free checked bag (well, on major carriers at least; cheap airlines like Wow probably not). But being easily able to carry your luggage around is worth having a few less wardrobe choices for a week or two! I have basically never regretted packing carry-on only, but I have regretted having a giant suitcase to carry over cobblestone streets and centuries old stone stairs. I spent a week outside at German Christmas markets last year, carry-on only. The key for me was good wool layers-toasty warm and wool doesn’t get smelly like synthetic do, so you can re-wear items (and thus pack fewer things! With more room for souveniers!) I think I brought 3 pairs of mid weight wool leggings, 3 wool tees or thin turtlenecks, and 3 big cozy sweaters for 7 or 8 days. Hey Sarah: Yes, most airlines, even some discount ones  offer 1 free checked bag for flights to Europe from the U.S (domestic not so much).. For more details on the policies for a whole bunch of airlines regarding fees and size restrictions, you can look at the cheapair.com site and click on help and it will have a FAQ on baggage fees. For just info on fees on the first bag, you can google farecompare and baggage fees and click on the farecompare and get a comprehensive listing of airline rates from the U.S.  Yes, WOW and Ryanair charge for first checked bag, international or not.  That being said, even if free, many people like keeping their bag(s) near them and avoid the potential hassle of lost bags, and long waits at the carousel. I prefer carry-on only and I pack the minimum but sometimes I do admit going with checking a bag if it is free so I don’t have to schlep it around the airport worrying about it (even if it is light weight, it is a pain if have to go to the bathroom or there is a delay). It depends on the airline and where I am flying to though! And after a long flight the last thing I want to do is wait at the baggage claim carousel! There is no right answer here, just some good advice from people like yourself. Actually the checked bags on US carriers are not free.  If you book an economy ticket, you are paying ~$90 more than the Basic economy ticket to get a “free” checked bag, be able to select your seat, and to make changes to your itinerary if needed.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/visit-germany-in-the-winter/,15 Magical Reasons to Visit Germany in the Winter,Germany,"“It was magical, this snow globe world” – Sarah Addison Allen When I told local Berliners years ago that it was going to be my first winter in Germany (and really, in life), they reacted by saying things like, “It’s so horrible! It’s SO cold!” “You’re going to hate it! It’s so dark and your nose is going to freeze off!” “Haha, that’s going to be funny. Your first winter and you chose Berlin?! Silly girl.” They had me terrified, and yes, it is pretty dark here. However if you think of it like a Batman comic book then it becomes kind of cool and edgy. A post shared by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jan 3, 2015 at 6:35am PST And fairly magical, too. Yes, it’s also pretty cold, but what I’ve come to realize is the cold isn’t so bad. With the right clothing and layering, it’s just fine. Besides, if I had left, I would have missed all of this amazing, delicious, incredibleness that is the German winter. Here are 15 reasons why you’ll want to visit Germany in the winter, too: The first major snow of the season in Berlin was magical. The skies turned blue, the kids grabbed their sleds, and good vibes were felt all around. There is so much to do in Berlin, regardless of the season and the weather, that I’ve made it my home for the past five years. This quirky and gritty city is like an onion with endless layers. Though the autumn and the summer are the more popular months to visit, here’s a list of amazing things to do in the winter in Berlin.  I didn’t know how I’d feel about Christmas markets, because I’m usually team Grinch, but they turned out to be really festive, fun, and quite delicious as well. What I love the most about the Christmas markets in Germany is how well the traditions are kept alive. For instance, it was lovely to see a woman dressed as Frau Holle shaking out a pillow case which is meant to symbolize snow falling at the Hattingen Christmas Market, and meeting locals dressed proudly (and rightfully so!) in olden-style clothing at the end of the Miner’s Wintermarkt, as part of the procession called the Mettenschicht at Düppenweiler. Germany’s Christmas markets are not only festive and fun, but also a great way to take a closer look at the locals’ cultures and traditions. Plus, they have excellent food and beverages. They also vary quite a bit region by region. In Cologne, there’s a more traditional market with a gorgeous light display on the Kolner Dom, In Berlin, there’s a Japanese Christmas market every other year, and in Hohenzollern castle outside of Stuttgart, there’s even a chocolate market. For a full listing of Germany’s best Christmas markets, check this post out!  Aachen Christmas market is my absolute favorite. Starting from November 23 – December 23 every year, the market welcomes visitors with beautiful lights and irresistible gingerbread aroma. The Aachen bakeries are famed for their gingerbread and marzipan bread that are exported to all over the world. However, at the Christmas market, they are freshly baked and taste even better! You know they take their gingerbread seriously when there’s literally a 6m tall gingerbread man mascot at the market. Delicious mulled wine, a warm, perfectly-spiced, amaretto drink that’s highly addictive, is also sold at the market. Additionally, the cathedral in Aachen is intricate and gorgeous. As a fan of architecture, and art history, I was amazed. Book your accommodation in Aachen here! Having associated the Black Forest with terms like ‘magical, mystical’, and delicious (the cake, I mean!) my whole life, I was still blown away by just how much of a winter wonderland the Black Forest can be. I enjoyed walking through the forest and admiring the snow-covered pine trees, but if you are looking for something more on the adventurous side, the Black Forest offers various slopes and rinks for skiing, snowboarding, as well as hiking. I highly recommend driving along the Panoramic route, assuming the roads are safe to drive and you feel comfortable, and stopping in the small towns along the way. Sasbachwalden is a favorite of mine. They’re particularly well known for their wine and cake. Book your accommodation in Black Forest here! Germany does Christmas right. Pictured here is the Christmas market at the Cologne Cathedral. Most major cities in Germany will have beautiful Christmas lights displays at the bigger Christmas markets, but be sure to check out the one at the Botanischer Garten in Berlin as well, which is next on the list!  Inspired by London’s famous Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Berlin’s very own botanic garden now lights up every November – December, making the area a beautiful winter wonderland. The route is about 1.5km, where visitors will walk through and past several light displays, illuminations, and 3D figures. There’s also regional food, open fire, and even an ice rink at the garden for ice skating enthusiasts. The entrance fee is on the pricier side, but it’s a great spot for anyone who’s into photography! It’s open from 16 November 2017 to 7 January 2018, open daily from 5pm to 9pm (closed on 24 and 31 December). Admission is €14.5 –€19, depending on the dates. Zeche Zollverein is a museum, an event venue, and one of the only coal mines in the world that’s declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its beautiful architecture. Each winter, you can ice skate on its long ice rink and enjoy delicious meals at its restaurant. A full-day ticket to the ice rink is €7, though if you are short on time, you can purchase the evening ticket for €5 and enjoy the light installation and even better atmosphere for 2 hours before it closes. You could also take a closer look at the beautiful architecture and learn more about the mining history by joining a tour. English guided tours are available on Saturday, Sunday and public holidays (except for 24, 25, and 31 December) at 3pm. The 2-hour long tour costs €6. You can book your tickets here and check the schedule here! If you grew up somewhere without winter like I did, then you’ve never had a white Christmas. Finally experiencing one was something really special. Though Bavaria’s Alps are probably the most dreamy and famous place to enjoy winter, you can enjoy snow anywhere in Germany, if you get lucky! Germany is the fairytale castle capital of the world. The already stunning castles look even more magical in the winter, and have you really been to Germany in the winter if you have not seen a castle and have a little Frozen moment yourself? The Hohenzollern Castles are easily the fairest castles in all the land, and are the ones I’d recommend prioritizing for dreaminess and fewer crowds, whether you want to see them from afar or up close. If you have more time, check out 12 other magical castles in Germany. Germany has groomed some of the best skiers and ice hockey players out there, so it’s no wonder that there are plenty of winter sports opportunities in the country. Every winter, the locals spend their free time skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snow hiking, and ice-skating. If you are a winter sport enthusiast, you are in for a treat! Some of the best places for winter sports include Zugspitze, which is the highest mountain in Germany, as well as Belchen, and Harz Mountains. A former dump, bordering the old Berlin wall, and a symbol of Berlin’s counterculture, the treehouse is a sight in the winter. When the wall fell, Osman Kalin who built this inventive abode was threatened with eviction (the building wasn’t exactly up to code, and the land wasn’t exactly his), but thanks to the neighboring church deciding to give him the land, and the rallying neighborhood protesters, he still lives there today. I am beginning to think that places that are good in the fall, are mostly also good in the winter. There are many national parks in Germany that are great for winter, but to me, Saxon Switzerland stands out. The hikes there are lovely and moderately easy, and the iconic Bastei Bridge looks stunning in white. What’s more? There’s apparently the other side of the bastion that’s exceptionally peaceful and tranquil during this time of the year. There are extended sauna hours, ice-time bowling, and a beer garden that turns into a winter lounge with a fireplace. Talk about cozy! To enjoy the spas in most of Germany, prepare to strip. No, I am not being cheeky (omg the pun). Most spas in Germany are textile-free atmospheres. Vabali Spa in Berlin is a big space with a variety of saunas that are perfect for muscle aches or just relaxing self-care day. I was slightly skeptical and thought it would be strange to go to a coed naked spa, but this is completely normal in this part of the world, and it actually felt freeing and comfortable! The atmosphere is respectful and upscale, even though everyone is sitting around completely naked. There are saunas and pools, as well as massages in most spas in Germany. I highly recommend the sports massage, and the 95°C sauna if you can handle it. It’s so good! Looking for an alternative Christmas vibe? Hamburg’s famous red light district plays host to the Santa Pauli Christmas market each year, full of sexy and erotic gifts, strip shows, and mulled wine of course! Due to the erotic nature, it’s adults-only. I haven’t personally been but I can only imagine it’s quite the experience! You can read more here.  Paragliding in the Alps can be awesome at any time, but there’s something particularly beautiful about doing so in the winter months. Zugspitze in Bavaria is Germany’s tallest mountain, and a popular place for paragliding. You can read more about how to book here. I’m glad I didn’t listen to everyone who told me to run, not walk, away from the winter in Germany. It has been snowy, beautiful, and honestly tons of fun. If you’re considering visiting Germany in the winter, but aren’t sure if you should, then let me make it an easy choice for you: do it. Where are your favorite winter wonderlands? Beautiful pictures, Kristin! One of my favorite moments from Taiwan was driving up into the mountains where there was a teeny tiny bit of snow on the side of the road and watching the locals pull over to take photos in front of it. I loved their excitement, growing up in Michigan has me taking a freezing, snowy winter for granted. Happy New Year! Thanks Anna! I admit if I had to deal with it year after year for months and months on end I’d get tired of it too, but it’s still novel for me 🙂 It’s definitely quirky. I didn’t think I was a winter person but I have actually been enjoying it. I envy everyone for whom snow is a novelty. You mke it look so beautiful! Traveling has made me realize that I grew up in a utopia with perfect weather. I have yet to find it replicated anywhere else, except for maybe the Mediterranean. I’m glad it’s a novelty for me too but honestly I’m excited to be somewhere warm again too! If only you had experienced a REAL enchanted winter forest! The one in your picture doesn’t have enough snow. But we’ve had less and less snow during the last winters, some say it’s due to global warming.I’ve started to read your blog from the beginning, it’s fascinating, you should write a book about your story one day 🙂 We got more snow the next day: http://on.fb.me/1HlgQOu does that count? I hope so. Don’t want to miss out 🙂 Thanks so much for the kind words. I would love to eventually write a book. Glad that for now, the blog is entertaining enough to make you want to read it from the beginning! Happy travels, Niki! I can’t help myself, but I hate mulled wine. I hate the smell and I don’t like the taste. And hockey rinks make me stumble across it almost all year long.  Anyway, when I think about ‘real’ Christmas atmosphere, I have to think about Christmas markets in German-speaking countries (both Germany and Austria). I feel like the Christmas spirit over there is much more intense than in other countries 🙂 You are forgiven for not loving mulled wine. There are a few other really good ones offered at the markets and of course I can’t think of what they’re called now, but there are many alternatives 🙂 Germany looks like it’s a lot of fun to explore in winter! I was also scared of winter before I moved to Riga over the summer, but it hasn’t been that bad. Like you said, it’s all about the layers. When properly dressed, I don’t really notice the cold. And I’ve actually kind of loved all the snow! That’s so cool that you studied abroad here. I went to about 13 of them myself. I didn’t want to see another one by the time I was done touring them but they really did get me into the holiday spirit. LOVE all the snow pictures. I’m sold. Must go to Germany. There’s no snow here ever so thanks for the wintery pics. 😉 Happy New Year! Happy New Year and glad I convinced you That looks so beautiful. I love winter (I’m from Maine) and I think most people don’t like it because they just don’t dress warm enough and a lot of people get vitamin D deficient which makes you feel miserable. I’ve never been to Germany but I’ve been to German christmas markets and they’re amazing. Especiallyt he gingerbread. I guess sideways rain and wind on certain days in Berlin made loving winter pretty tough, and not seeing the sun for weeks on end was rough too, but I still learned to appreciate it because it was so new to me and beautiful at times, too. takes me right back to my first xmas in Germany. Love the Mulled wine! I live in Chicago and really love the German Christmas Market they recreate there. I hope to go to one in Germany some day! I love Germany, especially in the winter: the Christmas markets, the cathedrals covered in snow, the food and the mulled wine. I’m feeling like in a fairytale. 🙂 I did a tour through Germany, Poland, slovakia and czech republic during winter of 2014. and had a blast as most of the aussie group hadn’t seen snow before. We missed some sights due to the intense snow fights, balls of fun.  The rooftops covered in snow in Prague was a beautiful sight. I hadn’t seen snow like that in at least a decade, and otherwise remembered it mainly as a kid. I totally get how the Aussies felt! I love the shots, and it comforts me that we’re planning to visit Munster, Germany in Jan/Feb. Your shots are gorgeous, and the advice re packing was helpful. I want to go very minimalist but with cool stuff — orrrr, pick up the cool stuff (boots, jacket!) there. Have you been to Munster in Winter? I hear it’s gorgeous, and since I’m from the Pacific NW and don’t mind chilly, cloudy, wet weather, I figged it’d be fine for me there. i have two wool long-sleeved tees, but LOVED your leggings and the sweater dress (I have a similar one) and jacket. I don’t have one of those. I’m 57. Wonder when it’s no longer okay to wear, say, leggings… I will wear leggings until the day I die. They’re so comfortable! I haven’t been to Munster but would love to hear your thoughts after you go! Great list! One day on the Bodensee was not enough for me, so that’s one place I’m eager to go back to. A student told me that there’s a great cable car trip somewhere down there, I think near Bregenz, and you have the best view. I live in Germany, Dortmund and I love visiting the city and others around, each time I visit a new city I learn something new. God bless Germany and it’s people Amazing pictures,I might need your recommendation as you stayed for Berlin winters.I’m planning to visit Germany this year in winters with a preference for snowfall. What time/month would you recommend to visit for snowfall but not to a level where I couldn’t do the sightseeing. I assumed Frankfurt/Dusseldorf got snowfall, but in my recent search it came not so much and I’m disappointed 🙁 I also wanted to include Berlin & Munich in my itinerary because of of the history. I am also planning to visit Nuremberg & Stuttgart there.Looking forward for your response. Thanks in advance. Hard to say since it can be as early as November and as late as March. I have seen it in December and January but it’s also not that common to get a lot of snow in Berlin. Hello.  I’m an American that works in China and is thinking of stopping in Germany on my way home either before (early November) or after (early December) my hitch.  What time of the year were those pictures?   Also would you pick Berlin over Munich if you did It again? I’ve actually never been to Munich but I have been living in Berlin on and off for almost 4 years so, Berlin!All of those were taken in December. I always said that I need to travel through Germany ore often, but does it have to be in Winter? 🙂 Ok, Kreuzberg, done that! Great places in here anyways. The fall is so nice here too! Summer is crowded but amazing. I also spent a really good time there during my last summer holidays and came back with smiley faces. Marvelous! Could you suggest some hiking trail in black forest ? Or can we just go for a walk in the forest while driving along the panoramic route ? I’d check alltrails! Oh, thank you for all the pictures. I grew up in Berlin and haven’t been there in the winter in about 25 years. Yes it is cold, but the Christmas market makes up for it. And you can go to a different Museum for a month…and KaDeWe is amazing.  I am going to visit my brother in November. Looking forward to it so much! Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/why-i-decided-to-leave-berlin/,Why I Decided to Leave Berlin,Germany,"I rode in the back of the taxi, weaving through the empty city streets, the lights reflected in the wet pavement and the walls of the Berliner Dom. I had forgotten that every fall the Festival of Lights comes to town, projecting patterns on the major buildings throughout Berlin’s Mitte neighborhood, synced to music. I’d visited each of these buildings the first time I came to Berlin, marveling at the gritty, enigmatic city I’d discovered. I made a promise to myself back then that I would come back and live here, a promise I made good on that following summer. That was over five years ago, and seeing the Festival of Lights again this year was so symbolic, as though it had come full circle, because my on-again, off-again love affair with Berlin is coming to an end. It’s strange, because I can remember a time when getting approved for my visa was the most important thing in the world to me. I couldn’t imagine living anywhere else. But the things that initially drew me here aren’t as important anymore, and I’m starting to feel that although it’s bittersweet, this chapter is coming to an end. Why? First, let’s go back in time. First and foremost, I love Berlin and I love Germany. I would not be who I am today without the experiences that I’ve had here, and I owe all of them to the opportunity of residency through an artist visa. I think it is incredible that Germany offers this visa and I have so much respect for the culture and the country as a whole. When I first came to Berlin, I fell in love with the alternative vibe. You can be whoever you want here and the beauty of it is, nobody cares! It’s so freeing. It feels a bit like Brooklyn meets Oakland to me, and I love how progressive it is. I love that there are ‘refugee welcome’ signs everywhere, and that people can be openly queer here (the most popular club here, Berghain, is a gay club after all), and I love that Germany was the first country in Europe to recognize a third gender. I also love that there are so many artists here, and that their work is visible on city walls and re-purposed urban spaces all over the city. Where else can you skateboard down an old airport tarmac, climb up into old spy domes that are now covered in art, and go to a nightclub on a Wednesday afternoon and stay there all the way until Monday morning? All of these things blew my mind when I first moved here. I was also a huge fan of the price tag. When I first moved to Berlin, I only paid €275 a month, all in, for a room in a shared flat. Now I’m leaving behind a top floor, two bedroom flat in the trendiest part of town, paying about a third of what I would in Southern California for the same thing. I felt cool living here, I saved a lot of money living here, and I loved the nightlife. So why would I choose to leave such a good thing? ﻿﻿ When I first signed my lease here, the most important thing to me was stability. I thought it was what I wanted more than anything else. However I’ve come to find that I am nomadic by nature and I keep wanting to take every opportunity that comes my way to travel. Therefore having an apartment and living the lifestyle I want are at odds and I constantly feel guilty for leaving an apartment that I’m paying for. I have also come to realize that I don’t like renting it out to people – they never treat it the way that I would. I hadn’t bargained for coming home constantly disappointed and finding things that I need to fix. The city is also a transient one, and most of the friends I had here have moved away or it turned out that we were only party friends. There is not much anchoring me here anymore. When I first moved here, I loved that I could always find something going on. I was going out with friends all the time, but my lifestyle has changed dramatically and I barely party at all anymore. The chances of me being awake past 10:30 PM are slim these days, and I like it that way. When I travel, I avoid cities. I spend almost all of my time in rural areas, close to the beach, up in the mountains, or deep in a desert. While I love the convenience of a big city, every time I’m in one I ache for nature. I spent most of my life close to an ocean, and I miss it terribly. I miss seeing the horizon. Ironically, I’ve never lived in a small town, but I’m starting to wonder if that’s exactly what I need. The next place I live needs to have more accessible nature. I don’t know where that may be but I am searching for it.  When I first moved to Berlin one of the things I liked about it was the grittiness. It’s strange because this has slowly but surely made me feel uncomfortable. As much as I love my neighborhood, I can’t get from the train station to my front door without being offered cocaine on a Saturday night. I’ve walked up on people shooting up heroin in the train station four times now, and when I’m alone it’s scary being around unpredictable people. I never know what I might be walking into. I know that addiction is slippery, seductive, and unmanageable, and I don’t blame those who are suffering. I don’t know what the answers are, but this is an aspect of living in a big city that gets harder for me year by year. I hope, by the way, that this doesn’t put anyone off of visiting. It took me 5 years to have these run-ins and by and large Berlin is a safe city, much safer than cities in the US.  I started to notice something about myself particularly when in southern Africa, Canada, and much of the US – I am a better version of me there. While I wish I was always smiling and approachable, my surroundings bring it out of me more. I really like smiling at people on the sidewalk, having random conversations with complete strangers, and being outwardly friendly to everyone. It just feels better to me and it is something that I want more of from the people in the next place I live. I know that I can do that here, but it’s just not part of the culture, and it sure is easier when others mirror it back to me. Finally, my biggest reason for leaving is to be closer to those I love. When I first left California, I just wanted to see the world and experience something new. However my close friends and family in California are still important to me. I’m lucky that I have been able to form even deeper bonds with my friends back home than I had before I left, and I’m wondering why I put an ocean between me and the people who I love so much. This experience away has taught me how valuable those relationships are and how much I want to nurture them. We only get so much time on Earth and I want to spend it with the people I love. That said, I think that everyone should be an expat at least once in life and see what it’s like to live in another language, another culture, and to appreciate what it is to assimilate and be in a place where nothing is familiar and everything is a learning experience. Overall I couldn’t be more thankful that I got to live in the coolest city in the world in its heyday. I recognize how privileged I am to be able to make these decisions about where I wish to live, and I value the passport I have that allows me to follow my whims. I’m not sure where my next home will be, but I do want it to be closer to the people I love, closer to nature, and with people who I feel connected with. Come January, I plan on going nomadic again. The road is my happy place, so why deny it? Thank you, Berlin, for five beautiful years. I would not be who I am without you. Dear Kristin, first of all, thanks for your blog, I ran quite accidentally into it half a year ago and although having already travelled and lived in many European countries, it inspired me to check the rest of the world, I went alone to Thailand and right now I’m right before my first longer trip through Asia on my own. BUT: reading your blog now and then, I finally got it why many travel bloggers avoid political topics 😀 I sense you’re rather leftist (democrat in the US), which was already quite clear, knowing you willingly decided to live in Berlin, which we really don’t understand in Munich 🙂  I totally agree that everyone should at least once live in a foreign country, experience the insane bureaucracy (especially in Germany), hunt for an apartment (in Copenhagen the craziest!) other challenges and try to assimilate, learn the language etc. I know what I’m talking about – I come from Czech and have lived in 5 other European countries, always learned the language to a fluent level. Now I’ve been since 3 years in Munich, so I’m an Ausländer just like you. What I totally disagree with and why I think you should get a viewpoint different from the Berlin one, is that having signs evrywhere saying “refugees welcome” is not that cool as it might seem at first sight. I definitely think most people are good and both you and I mean well: helping others is good. But if you were interested in politics, if you read the international agreements and the crazy European laws made by the European commision, who was not elected by any European citizen, you’d have to know that Germany has broken so many international laws, letting EVERYONE into the country and giving EVERYONE a lot of German money, it is quite insane. Now, there are many problems to that: 1) Islam being a political strategy degrading women (not muslim-people are bad, but islam sure is. (I can only recommend reading Koran and hadiths before posting an interview with a muslim woman travelling the world, ranting about others staring – no mater what an awesome person she might be, that’s irrelevant.) 2) Amongst the refugees, there are sure people in need of help. Why don’t they get it from the rich neighbouring countries in the Middle East according to international law..?! Then there are official documentaries of families, quite harmless, that have come to Germany and are allowed otherwise illegal(!) polygamy, not working, having 15 children, the father saying that he prefers to be with his children instead of going to work. Is that ok with you? Well me, as I’ve been paying almost 50 % taxes from my income in Germany, having to invest a lot into my studies before, having learned perfect German before, otherwise I’d have had no chance of finding a job here, I’m quite pissed. I’ve met quite a few Middle-Easterners with this same view while living in Vienna as well. German (and European!) politics is totally unfair to those who actually care about the law, study, try to learn the language, go through the exhausting visa process.. I’ve met so many Egyptians, Iranians, Afghanis and others…  3) The people were not checked, there definitely are terrorists, rapists etc. amongst them, who are dangerous, yet were let to enter Germany exactly thanks to many protesters screaming “refugees welcome” in 2015. 4) What even many German people don’t know, is that – if they NEED to help (although I think many feel the need to help just to feel good, it’s selfish) – there are quite a few East-European countries which are fucked up due to a long Sovetian supremacy, and German supremacy before, and Austrian supremacy before… My grandma in Czech Republic, after having 3 children and having worked hard all her life, gets 350 EUR per month; the rent being approx. 250 EUR. And that’s Czech republic, the wealthiest country from the East-European block. Imagine what it’s like to live in Ukraine and how are the people there. No, not better than in Iran or Libya, where there’s btw no war (but the people are accepted to Germany as war refugees…). Yet people from Ukraine have it much more complicated to become a refuge n Germany than an Afghani, who’s most probably bringing totally unacceptable cultural habits. There are many factors to be thought about before stating it’s good to accept some people into the land. And having been attacked by a group of muslim men in Copenhagen bar, having been screamed at and my car kicked in Munich(!) while driving (women shouldn’t drive!) by muslim ‘refugees’ (I lived 50m from a “refugge”, aka illegal immigrants camp, I think certain people should see the other side of the coin before “loving all the signs saing ‘refugees welcome’ “. (And maybe ask the question why you haven’t traveled the Middle East….? As well as many other travel bloggers..?) To the “third gender” remark in your article, well…the problem of the opponents here is not that it’s bad to be gay or whatever. It’s that SUPPORTING them leads to dysfunctional families, then dysfunctional state, then poverty, crime etc. (very simplified) – tolerating it is ethically necessary, supporting it in any form is destructive for all. Nothing against any homo-, trans- or anything. The thing you’re referring to is part of neomarxism, which is a new form of marxism – not only wanting to achieve social equality, but equality in everything: race, religion, gender (in the UK they are about to stop calling the mother the mother and the father the father… it’s insane…inclusive the male-breastfeeding attempts in the US and letting 6y old children choose their hormonal cure to become another gender!!!). Think about this: a statue of Karl Marx has been raised in Germany recently; whilst his economically wrong and ethically devil ideology has killed millions of people all around the world, including my country! And German leftists glorify this erroneous man. So that’s what the US democrats should think about – and that’s why East-Europe are such “racists” and “xenophobes”: because they already experienced a totalistic supremacy wanting the “good” of all. That being said, I hope I haven’t sounded too agressive (passionate is the word, I have my own political blog) – I’m much more friendly and shy in person 😀 and if you’d like to experience Munich and Bavaria (my bf is native Bavarian) before moving away and share what we both have to share, I can accomodate you.. 🙂   I wish you all good on your next life episode 😉  Lucie Now I’m thinking the post looks quite not-nice, but that’s just me getting intellectual & political, I can get over it 🙂 ; if you’d like to spend some time in Bavaria, you’re welcome here, there will for sure be some traditional Christmas markets around Munich- my bf knows the really traditional stuff which no tourists explore, my almost-brother-in-law rides a bull and we could sit on it 😀 (I’m totally against it but well, it’s a weird German thing and I can’t change it..) and other things. I’d get some travel-motivation in exchange from you maybe :), I hope 🙂  Just let me know, we have a big house, I’m a feelancer and he’s an entrepreneur (very busy one, grrr)…Althought I get it you probably get a lot of messages and invites and suggestions from many people… It’s up on you 🙂  Cheers Thanks for sharing your views, Lucie. Despite the fact that I might not agree with or understand my cultural differences with those from other countries, I grew up in a nation of immigrants and I’m descended from refugees (my foremothers and fathers came over to the US from Europe on the Mayflower), so how can I turn around and say that those from war-torn countries don’t deserve a safe home? I don’t know their struggle, and I welcome them in my own country, too. Diversity is what makes both Berlin and the US beautiful. Additionally, why should I be allowed here but those who are poor or coming from a war-torn country aren’t? That ain’t right.  I can’t see a connection between increased violence and allowing a third gender. I think that’s attaching a lot of unrelated meaning to one issue that frankly doesn’t affect and shouldn’t involve either you or I.  I think the bigger problem is forgetting where we come from, which is from a place of love, acceptance, and nonjudgement. I don’t let fear rule my feelings towards others, and though it might sound idealistic, I know that it’s possible for everyone to return to love, to accept each other, and to realize that humans are more alike than they are different. I’d rather be inclusive over exclusive. Traveling the world over the past 6 years and meeting people from a great many religions and cultural backgrounds (including Muslims) has only strengthened my belief that people are good.  Beautifully said Kristin. And wow how you can trace your history in the US that far back! Lucie, you have perfectly represented what many of us know to be true. I am an American living in northern Italy, learning the language and trying to understand the culture. This time has made me deeply appreciate what the US has. There is so much bureaucracy here and the taxes are unbelievable!I am a conservative and reading the countless blog posts like this have made it very clear I would not be successful in the travel blog industry. I have a deep appreciation of other cultures and a world without borders will only dilute or completely destroy these cultures. Many of these refugees do not assimilate (i.e. look at London). I wonder, as well, why other middle eastern countries nearby do not take in these refugees when their cultures are much more similar than western european ones.Unfortunately, our opinions are not welcome in travel communities but I’m so glad that you still said something! Makes me feel less alone!Also, I really love Bavaria. My husband grew up there and we just returned from a long weekend near Munich. It was so incredibly beautiful! Everyone’s opinion is welcome here. There are lots of niches in the travel community. I’d hate to see you hold onto that limiting belief that you can’t write what you feel.  Thanks for sharing. I feel this post deserves at least one fact check. 30% of Lebanon’s population is made up of refugees while Jordan has the 2nd highest number of refugees per capita in the world. These facts are rarely mentioned in the media. So yes, ME countries are taking in huge amounts of refugees. Most other ME countries are battling their own conflicts, so it wouldn’t make sense for someone to escape one war just to find him/herself in another. Can other Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia do more? Yes of course, but that’s not a good enough excuse for the rest of the world to not help out. We teach children to follow positive role models… I would hope that principle also applies to international relations. Hey Kristin. TBH I was wondering when you would move on to the next place :). You and my best friend Colleen have taught me so much about Berlin and Germany, you can’t imagine. I went from being hesitant and concerned about the history to being eager to explore this interesting country and city. I have it now on my must see for a European trip. Thanks for helping me grow and be more open minded (and forgiving, especially when such great efforts have been made). I never thought I would include Vietnam as another must see!  I think it is very sweet what you said about your family and friends, they are lucky to have you and you are lucky to have them be “by your side” even when physically far away. I hope you find a nice place. I can’t help but be reminded of your post about Humboldt County, CA. It looks as beautiful as the southern Oregon coast which I really enjoyed!Best wishes on finding a new “home” and enjoy being a real nomad again! Thank you so, so much for this post. I lived in Australia for 12 years (7 in Sydney, 5 in Melbourne) before moving back home to. Singapore 8 years ago.Like you, i was so happy when i got my Aus residency visa. But I had my run in Aus and decided it was time to head home – not the home where i laid my head at night, but the home where my friends and family still lived.I hope you’re able to enjoy the next phase of your life where that may be. Thank you so much for the well wishes and it’s nice to feel understood. Home is where the people we love are. Absolutely! I’ve been living in Melbourne for 8 months and the majority of my friends and family are in Europe and the USA. Aside from undesirable career opportunities, being so far from lifelong friends and family is the reason I’ll not renew my visa after the year is up. It’s heartbreaking but a 25 hour flight from family is not easy! So, looks like another 3-6+ months of travelling are the solution 🙂 That’s a good solution! Hey Kristin! Thank you so much for writing this. I really related to the section “I like the version of me who travels better.” I recently settled down in Brooklyn after backpacking solo for a year, a trip including Annapurna, Kinabalu, Komodo and even Berlin – all places your blog inspired me to go! While stability feels GREAT and Brooklyn I believe is a similar ecosystem to Berlin is so many aspects, I also have felt that it’s been hard to bring the “travel Juliette” back here fully. Priorities simply shift when you plant your feet, and I’m working on steps in my media career so that in a few years time I’ll be equipped to go fully nomadic with a remote agency – hopping around coworking spaces every few months. However sometimes I feel REAL comfortable, and not sure if I want to dive back into that unknown after it was such a battle to find stability again. So reading this article was refreshing and so needed – seeing that you have taken smaller trips throughout your time in Berlin but still taken in the city in full, and now… you feel ready to get back on the road permanently.  I have my first “small trip” booked coming up for a few weeks solo in Costa Rica, and feeling anxious that the “version of me who travels”, will have a hard time coming out after living here in such a different environment for a bit. I’d love to hear more about what your first big or small trip was like after you planted your feet in Berlin. And how that “short term travel version of you” was different than the version of you when you were on the road in SE Asia long term.  I can’t stress enough how much your blog has impacted the most pivotal year of my short life, and continues to impact afterwards with posts like this! Thanks for all you do. Aw that’s so nice to read, Juliette! Thank you for the kind words and I’m so glad you liked the places I recommended! I have to confess, I didn’t truly stay here and that was always a battle for me. I’d be here for a month here, a couple weeks there, and then I’d be on the road again. I didn’t really give being in one place a chance until last fall when I decided to stay in Berlin for 3 months without getting on a plane. It was probably the healthiest three months I’ve had in terms of developing a routine, working out, and cooking my own food and being healthier. That said I couldn’t wait to travel again by the end of it.Here were my thoughts about traveling again after being at home for a while, and out of the backpacker groove, here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/going-back-to-thailand/ I did find my stride again, so don’t worry about that part. Remember how adaptable we are!  I also just try to remember that there are pros and cons to each thing and I just try to love and embrace what those are when I can. This was really great to read, thanks for sharing.  Are you going full nomadic now? Or maybe settling some quasi-roots down near some friends in the Americas? For now I’m thinking fully nomadic but my mom’s home is always open to me, so I’m lucky. Very interesting article..  I’m coming up on 4 years in Germany and do feel the guilt of being so far away from everyone and also often get tired of where I’m at, but at the same time love being an expat and am afraid of being bored if I move back. It’s brave of you to finally make the leap and move on to the next chapter because that’s definitely not easy! Good luck in your next venture! 🙂 I would have felt that way a year ago, but this year, I just feel ready. You’ll know when it’s time <3 Hi Kristin I am Prakash from Mumbai, India.  I loved reading this blog as well as all the other ones.  I really appreciate your spirit of adventure. By the way, I too have a Southern California connection. My elder brother and family are settled in San Diego since 2002.  All the best for wherever your wanderlust may take you next.  Prakash Iyer Small world! Oh my, this post hits home so much. Thanks for sharing, Kristin!I was born in Poland, immigrated to Canada over 20 years ago and lived in Spain and US for a bit here and there in the last 10 years. Currently, in Poland, feeling like an expat in my own homeland. I’ve decided to take on this adventure cause I was tired of the routine-filled life in Canada and needed a change. This opportunity came up and I took it. I’m a baker that loves to travel. I’ve moved here for a baking job in August and almost 4 months in.. I just don’t feel myself. I miss the New Orleans version of me. I know that’s my soul place and that’s where I want my base to be (if getting a green card was only that easy). Like you wrote, I am a better version of me there. I love the approachable, smiling me and can’t be that here. And I grew up here! I miss having random conversations with strangers, porch parties with neighbours as well and the chill vibe of life that can’t be found in this culture. The cold weather might have something to do with it though. Ha! I feel like I’m the Northern girl wanting so much to be the Southern one. 🙂I’ve signed an apartment lease till June 2019 and I plan to stick to it but if I won the lottery.. I’d be out of here in a second, lol! For now I’m using this ‘adventure’ as an experience that already taught me a lot. While waiting for another path to open for me, I’ll enjoy living by the sea and having lots of me-time to figure things out.I wish you all the best in your next adventure and will continue to follow your journey, like I have so far.Good luck to both of us! Hey if nothing else, you learned a lot about what you really want and need from this move. I’m sure one day you’ll remember these days fondly too <3 I’ll come visit your new home, or happily cross paths as a nomad 🙂 I would absolutely love that! Can’t believe we hardly had a chance to hang out when I lived in Berlin! I remember talking about this at TravelCon (sorry for being so off-putting, btw – I had some kind of stomach infection and I WAS DYING). I absolutely loved Berlin and miss it everyday, but now that I’m settled back into Canada I can see Berlin in a different light – certainly not a long-term home (for me at least). No doubt you’ve made the right choice! Oh no that must’ve been rough! I’m sure it feels different feeling like you’re leaving before you’re ready as well. I would have felt that way up until now for sure. Who knows, I may after I leave as well. We’ll see 🙂 Hi Kristin! I´ve been following your blog to and from, and receiving your email subscription since about a year, but I had no clue you were based in Berlin! Had I known, I´d probably ask to meet sometime!! I am also living here since 5 years, originally, from Sweden, but unlike you I´d actually like to stay for a few more years! But I also really do miss the nature here!I wish you a pleasant move back home!  Best wishes,Erica Thanks for reading Erica! It is a wonderful city, and I do love it. I understand your desire to stay. Sorry we didn’t get a chance to meet this time! You have a lovely blog and also I am so glad you are honoring the changes and constants in your life that tell you it’s time to go!  I have but one caution for you.  It’s merely about expectations.  I moved back to the Western Hemisphere to be closer to loved ones and my former homes, one of which is Cali.  I found that both family and friends have moved on, they are too busy, they can’t afford visits to where I am (Northern Mexico), vice versa, and/or they are no more inclined to connect than when I was in Dubai, a zillion miles away.  So I would say to my own former self, “Tone down your expectations about that aspect of the move and make sure they’re realistic.” I definitely hope you have a different experience regarding loved ones.  And it’s only one of the reasons you mentioned.    BEST WISHES FOR A SMOOTH TRANSITION AND A HAPPY CHRISTMAS! Hey Suzanne, thanks so much for the kind words! I try never to have expectations (of course that’s pretty difficult as a mere human being), but I appreciate your caution because expecting to come back to a red carpet rolled out every time would set me up for disappointment I’m sure. I’ll remain open to being delighted but will leave room for people to have their own things going on too 🙂 Kristin, Thanks so much for being who you are and having the courage to share it with the world! It’s about time I put this into writing, after I’ve sought almost 100% of my inspiration and courage to go on my first south east asia / Sri Lanka trip from your blog. Your tone and way of both experiencing and sharing your trips is really unique. While traveling myself, I’ve decided to interrupt my own expat-ly life, living in Syracuse/NY and eventually LA for the last four years…to return to my roots, Leipzig/Germany. While put in Leipzig now and not traveling at the moment, your posts continue to inspire me to be a better person so thank you!And no, real Germans, those who’ve never been out of the country and are full of their own (oftentimes truly beautiful) German-ness, won’t smile at you, won’t appreciate a compliment, and won’t wish you a happy day. It’s sad, it’s suffocating, and makes me miss Sri Lanka and LA.Wishing you all the very best in your new city of choice!Kristin: you even inspired me to start my own blog! Dina-Marie thank you SO MUCH for your kind comment! You warmed my heart. It means so much to me that you enjoy my writing and that it has inspired you. I hope that you have wonderful adventures and just know that there are things about home that, after I’ve left, I can’t stand now too. Like the traffic and pressure to be perfect in LA. UGH. I miss Berlin where everyone just wore black and no makeup! Funny how a little change of scenery can totally change our perceptions of home. Girl I haven’t even finished reading but this article came straight out of my soul! I feel the same way about cities and traveling and also about the surroundings, it does have an impact! Omg I am taking action now to leave Berlin. Moved here in 2012 and it is just enough now! I still hold it in such a beautiful place in my heart and memory. I’m grateful to Berlin for so many reasons, but I don’t wish I still lived there. The heart knows when it’s time to move on!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/autumn-in-germany/,12 Things to Enjoy During Autumn in Germany,Germany,"It’s autumn in Germany and it’s hard to think of a better place to be. The days are often sunny, a perfect match for the bright yellows, oranges and reds of the changing leaves. As a Californian it’s a season I’ve only experienced a few times though it’s quickly become my favorite. Apart from the colors, evidence of fall abounds in the food, the festivals, and the things to do that are best enjoyed in the autumn months. If you’re a lover of the autumn, too, and if you’ll be spending some of it in Germany, these are some of the best ways to enjoy it:  Though perfect autumn weather and foliage is difficult to predict, the leaves are usually at their peak colors around the middle to the end of October, depending on the year. Though you can experience colder temperatures and rain, there’s almost always a week or two of beautiful weather, particularly in the south.  This castle is dreamy at any time of year. I should know, I’ve seen it in the winter, and the summer and the fall. However seeing the castle with changing leaves, and enjoying the walk to it, just make it a little bit more magical. You can go into the castle or take my personal favorite route, which is a little hike to a vantage point across from it. It can be as short as 20 minutes or you can turn it into a longer panoramic hike. You can find directions on how to do that in this post.  Keeping it in the family, there is another Hohenzollern castle which is slightly less famous but certainly no less grand and opulent. Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is the biggest castle I’ve ever seen, perched high atop a rocky hill, and then surrounded by water and the town. Tours take place inside and there are several vantage points that are wonderful to take photos from as well, and it truly is beautiful with golden leaves around it! There’s also a banquet which takes place every now and then inside the castle, including when I was there in October. Read all about it here.  If you’re like me and you immediately begin celebrating Halloween as soon as the fall hits, then you’ll probably find this abandoned hotel to be irresistible. Though the hotel was officially abandoned in the mid-2000s, it looks like it’s stuck somewhere between the 1920s and 1960s, with a very Wes Anderson-esque feel. You can still walk inside and see how the rooms were decorated, including the bedrooms and the attic. Some even say it’s haunted. You can find it in Freudenstadt at the edge of the Black Forest, which literally translates to ‘Joy Town’. What’s not to love about that? Contact these guys for information about visiting. Though the website is in German, I was able to get a tour in English.  Another beautiful find in Baden-Württemberg, is a privately owned castle that the family still lives in. They conduct the tours themselves, taking you through the restored rooms and to one of the oldest non-secular paintings in Europe, dating back over 800 years. They’re also known for their delicious cake, which I enjoyed with beautiful orange leaves fluttering down on me as I watched the sunset – a truly magical evening. The castle is also home to 21 friendly ghosts, and they offer ghost tours in the autumn in the evenings. You can find out more here.  One of my favorite parts of Germany, Baden-Württemberg is perfect for road trips. It has it all from castles to waterfalls and stunning leaves. I also happened upon a field of sunflowers somewhere between the Black Forest and the Swabian Alps in October. It’s hard not to love that! For more of the best day trips from Stuttgart check out this post. This strangely shaped, perfectly round bridge is located in the middle of nowhere, in Germany’s Saxony. Its name translates to the Devil’s Bridge and I love it in the fall for the beautiful colors, but also because the bridge is just inherently spooky with that shape and name. The best way to get there is to drive yourself, though there are public transportation options. You can find my full guide here.  While we’re talking about Saxony, you absolutely must stop by this national park and go for a hike, or several. The landscape is surreal, with sharp rock piles appearing seemingly out of nowhere. The park’s main future, the Bastei Bridge, rests neatly within the rock towers, and is beyond beautiful at golden hour. And again, visiting in the fall is nice because of the foliage, but also because the crowds are smaller. You can read my full Saxon Switzerland guide here.  This place is kind of nuts. My friend and I stopped by during our Saxony Road trip on a whim and ended up staying for hours. It’s like a theme park that you can climb through and all over and while that would normally seem like it’s meant for children, it’s actually the perfect overnight adventure. Though it’s an ode to the culture of the people who used to live in this area, hundreds of years ago, the place just screams Halloween to me with its colorful structures and leaning spires on the roofs. Best of all, it never closes and you can even rent a house for the night to stay in, complete with bubbling cauldron bath. Read more on my Best Road Trips from Berlin post.  We can’t talk about the autumn in Germany without bringing up Oktoberfest! If you’re into beer, or just love the idea of the camaraderie of singing songs while wearing a Dirndle, check out Oktoberfest in Munich. Be sure to book your accommodation as soon as you know you’ll be there, as it’s the most popular time of year to visit.  Anytime is a good time to hang out in Berlin, but in October you can see the festival of lights which illuminates some of the major buildings throughout the city. You can also get some truly beautiful, sunny, and warm days in October along with the changing leaves. It’s a nice contrast to see the grittiness and street art of Berlin and the beautiful nature around it. After all, Berlin has an abundance of green spaces so you might as well enjoy them with some beautiful colors! Read my ultimate Berlin guide for ideas of what to do there, where to stay, and what to eat.  Sanssouci is the closest major castle to Berlin and also near a university town, Potsdam. While the castle is cool, what I love most about it are the grand, sweeping gardens which are particularly beautiful when the leaves change. They are also free to visit and easy to reach via train from Berlin. It takes about an hour to get to Potsdam, though I suggest several for enjoying it fully.  Finally, Spreewald is another beautiful day trip in Brandenburg – not too far from Berlin. It’s easy to reach by train, and is famous for its pickles and usually-green tree tunnels over the water. However in the fall, it all changes color and it is stunning! It’s also far less crowded than during the summer. Rent a kayak and take yourself through the gorgeous changing foliage and enjoy the peace and quiet. You can read more about enjoying Spreewald here. Though I simply can’t pick a time of year that is the best to be in Germany, because each has its own special beauty and festivities that go along with them, each year makes me fall more and more in love with the autumn. You can pretty much always count on at least a week or two of sunny weather along with beautiful changing leaves, and smaller crowds. Those are some benefits that are easy to love! Germany is such a great country to travel to, but I have only been during the summer.  The Fall looks beautiful and is probably the best time to go. Any time is a good time! You make me want to do a Baden-Wuerttemberg road trip! I lived in BW for about 4 years spread out across my lifetime but I didn’t see a lot of these things you wrote about! I never had access to a car before, so doing a road trip would be fun I think Some of it can be accessed by train too! Such a gorgeous part of Germany. I’ve been to Germany a lot, including in the fall, but never to Saxon Switzerland.  It looks amazing!  Thanks for the gorgeous photos and inspiration. It’s still such an unknown part of Germany to most foreign tourists and it’s so gorgeous! Hi Kristin, So I’m planning a trip to Germany in October and am focusing on the castles by using your recommendations. First, is it possible to do both the Neuschwanstein tour and the Hohenschwangau tour on the same day? We will be staying near them in Fussen for 2 nights. Also, in regards to  the 3 castles near Stuttgart, can you reach the Hohenzollern castles and the Lichtenstein castle via public transport or is a having a car the best option? If a car is the best option, I’m assuming I  can rent a car for a few days out of Stuttgart? And, in regards to the Burg Eltz castle, have you done the 5 km hike up to the castle? Thanks for your help! I’m really looking forward to visiting Germany in October. Yes you can visit both in the same day. Hohenzollern and Lichtenstein are tough to get to via public transport. A car will be much easier and yes, you can rent in Stuttgart. That’s what I’ve done each time. It’s pretty easy driving out in the country roads. I haven’t hiked to Burg Eltz. If you do, LMK how it is! Have fun 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hohenzollern-sigmaringen-castle/,The Ultimate Guide to Hohenzollern Sigmaringen Castle,Germany,"Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is quite possibly the fairest castle in all the land. Though Germany is full of gorgeous castles, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is one of the largest and grandest I’ve ever laid eyes on, rising up out of an outcropping of rocks and stretching across almost an entire city block. If you’re into magical castles you’ve got to add this one to your list. However there are a few things to know in terms of the best vantage points for photographing it and how to get the most out of the tour inside:  Built in the early 11th century, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is located in the Swabian Alps in southern Baden-Wüttemberg, Germany. As you step into the castle, keep in mind that the oldest parts of it are actually hidden underneath the rebuilt structures over the years, which I think adds to the castle’s gothic charm. The first alterations took place in the 12th century, where the Helfenstein family rebuilt the castle with buckel stones. In the 15th century, under the instruction of the then Count of Werdenberg, the castle was expanded outwards on the northeast side, followed by another expansion westwards just a couple of years later.  The current owners, the House of Hohenzollern, is a dynasty of former princes, electors, kings and emperors of Hohenzollern, Brandenburg, Prussia, the German Empire, and Romania. The family was prosperous and powerful, so much so that there’s another famous Hohenzollern Castle just an hour or so away, which is equally stunning. Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1893 and had to be rebuilt. Destructions and constructions continued to take place up until 1902, with each construction leaving its mark in and around the castle. It’s safe to say that the castle went through a lot to become what it is today.  Today, the prince and princess of Hohenzollern welcome visitors with guided tours through history at the castle. Expect to see important private collections of over 3000 pieces of armor, opulent Victorian interior and exterior architecture design (don’t forget to look up!), as well as a royal banquet with the same 5 courses the royalties had for their wedding in 1893 (but don’t go if you’re vegetarian or vegan). You can find out more on their official website.  If you are intrigued and want to check it out yourself, here’s more information about the guided tours: Opening Hours: Daily from April – October from 9AM – 6PM (last tour starts at 5PM), and daily from November – December and March from 9AM – 5PM (last tour starts at 4PM) except for December 24-25 and December 31Tour duration: 60 minutes.Time: Multiple times every hour.Entrance fee including tour: €9.50 per person.Special feature: No advance registration necessary for solo travelers.  You can buy your tickets upon arrival. While the guided tours are usually held in German, a leaflet in English is given. Group tours in English can also be arranged with advance notice via email.  Though photos are not allowed of the inside (I obtained permission for the purposes of this article), don’t despair, as some of the best views of the castle are from the outside. There are, in my opinion, three perfect places to take photos of the castle. The first is at the entrance, which has a long, steep walkway leading up to it. You’ll see the archway above you, and the walkway to the start of the walking tours to the right. I personally loved the shot walking up as well as this one, which was just to the left of the entrance, in front of the cafe:  Next are the two spots in town that provide a nice, full overview of the castle. The first is easy to find – just head to the bridge across from the castle. There’s a parking lot that you can park in located here, and from there it’s a 30-second walk to the bridge. I liked this spot in particular since the castle reflects on the water below. With the changing leaves when I went in October, it was nothing short of dreamy.  Until, that is, I made it to the observation point. To reach the point, head to this parking lot and walk to the bridge which will take you over the train tracks and the highway. Then you’ll see a nice little trail through the trees to the right, which snakes back around to the viewpoint. In all it takes about 5 to 7 minutes to walk it – it’s short and easy.  Again, going in the fall was a treat thanks to the golden changing leaves. They made the perfect frame. Hohenzollern makes a perfect day trip from Stuttgart. If you are driving, you can simply follow this map and it should be possible to get there in 2 or so hours. There’s a car park next to the castle and you will have to pay 2 euro to park there. Public transportation is also available. Take the morning train from Stuttgart bound for Reutlingen, followed by the 7606 bus to Honau. Get off outside the Aksent Hotel and begin your walk to the castle. The journey from Stuttgart should take you about 3 hours. If you want to see the other Hohenzollern from afar, and I highly recommend that you do, check this post out! Though we don’t live in fairytale times anymore, sometimes it’s fun to pretend you could be royalty, taking in the opulence and splendor of these castles of old. For history buffs or those who just watched Disney obsessively like I did, taking a trip through Germany’s Baden-Wüttemberg feels like a storybook, and the Hohenzollern castles are the cherry on top. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Baden-Wüttemberg, however all opinions of this magical castle are my own.  I didn’t realize there was more than one Hohenzollern castle! I went to the other one that was in the article about Stuttgart day trips, and I didn’t even know about this one lol. There are so many awesome castles in Baden-Wuerttemberg and I wish I had visited more of them while I was living in Stuttgart! Time for a return trip! I didn’t either! I was confused up until I went. My mom was from Germany and I was born in Stuttgart. We used to go just about every year and visited every Castle there was in Germany. Please do go back and spend about 3 or 4 months like we did when we were there. But then again we had family to stay with so there was no expense in food or lodging. I hope you get the opportunity to go back. My mother passed away 6 years ago God how I miss her. I have one relative left over there that I know of and don’t know how to get ahold of him. So sad life goes by too quick please go back. Hi Ramona, sorry to hear about your mom and hope you can get back in contact with your family. I have been back down south a few times and it truly is magical. I’ve been fortunate enough to be able to live in Berlin for the past 5 years, and have fallen in love with Germany. All the best to you! Nice post with great pictures. may I point out that the town is called Sigmaringen not Hohenzollern. It is the Hohenzollern Castle in the town of Sigmaringen 😊 Danke! Hm, I did know that but now I’m wondering where I messed that up in the post. Was it in the last section?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/castles-in-germany/,The 13 Most Magical Castles in Germany,Germany,"Germany is the fairytale castle capital of the world. This is a bold claim, I know, as there’s tough competition from all over Europe and beyond. However in the place where fairytales were born (Brothers Grimm, anyone?) with castles that inspired Disney, it’s hard to think of a more magical place. Germany also has volume on its side, with over 20,000 castles to choose from! That might seem overwhelming, so I’m here to narrow it down for you. From almost every state, here are the most magical castles in Germany from the well-known to the relatively obscure: After much deliberation, this is the fairest castle in all the land, IMHO. It’s an easy drive there from Stuttgart in Baden-Württemberg, possibly the most beautiful and underrated state in Germany. It doesn’t matter what time of year you visit Hohenzollern, it will be stunning. Can you imagine it with fall foliage or a dusting of snow? It must look like a dream. Part of what makes this castle so lovable is the lack of crowds. When I came here two years ago in the middle of summer, it was just a few cyclists and my friends and I enjoying this view – that’s it! No bus loads of tourists and no selfie sticks. This is an easy walk as well, but you need to know how to find it. More on that, and how to fly over it in a hot air balloon, here. If you want to visit the inside of the castle, find tour times here. Lichtenstein castle, not to be confused with the country, is a strong contender for the most magical castle in all the land. The gothic revival style and the way it’s built upon this escarpment make it look like it came straight out of a fairytale – and in some ways it is. The modern castle was inspired by the novel Lichtenstein and was built in the early 1840s. Nowadays it’s a tourist attraction with tours all throughout the day and several hiking trails nearby. The easiest way to get there is by car.  Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen is one of the largest and grandest I’ve ever laid eyes on, rising up out of an outcropping of rocks and stretching across almost an entire city block. If you’re into magical castles you’ve got to add this one to your list. Located in Swabian Alps in southern Baden-Wüttemberg, the castle makes a perfect day trip stop from Stuttgart. I recommend joining the tour to learn the story behind the important private collections of over 3000 pieces of armor, opulent victorian interior and exterior architecture design (the tour is conducted in German, but a leaflet in English is provided). There are a few vantage points to see the castles from different angles and perspectives. More on that, and how you can get to Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, here. There aren’t many castles in Saxony, but Moritzburg, a Baroque palace in the town of the same name, is a worthy pit stop during a long weekend trip out of Berlin. Just like in the movies and fairytales I read as a kid, this castle is surrounded by a moat. Further, it’s delightfully symmetrical, and who doesn’t love symmetry? The area has long been a favorite hunting area, particularly for royalty in the region over the centuries. If you do decide to take a tour of the inside, prepare to see hundreds of antlers and walls covered with gold-gilded leather. I didn’t want to think about how many deer it took to decorate the rooms in this place. It’s – shall we say – an interesting experience. Find tour times here. Schloss Sanssouci in Potsdam takes about an hour to reach by train from Berlin. What makes this castle so worth a visit is the surrounding area, which has acres of dreamy walking paths and gardens that are all free to enjoy. To me this keeps the original intent of Sanssouci, which was meant for leisure and enjoyment rather than to serve as a seat of power. In addition to the castle featured above, there are many historical buildings with different styles of architecture from various periods in Germany history, many of which are used as university classrooms today. It’s possible to tour the inside as well. I feel it’s a baroque explosion of gaudiness and opulence, but you be the judge. More on that here. “Burg Eltz is one of only three Rhine castles to have survived through the last thousand years intact. The oldest part of the building is from the 9th century, with further wings built in the 12th and 15th centuries. Incredibly, it has been in the Eltz family for 33 generations, and members of the family still live there, putting fresh flowers in the public rooms everyday. On a guided tour you will see the incredible wall murals in the 15th-century bedroom, the banqueting hall, some of the armoury rooms, and more – like most German castles, you will need to join a guided tour to see inside, but there are plenty in English. Burg Eltz is accessible as a day trip from Trier, Koblenz, and Cologne. On weekends and public holidays from May to October you can take a train to Hatzenport or Treis-Karden, and then the Burgenbus that goes straight to the castle. Outside these times, take a train to Moselkern, and then you can do the 5km hike or take a taxi up to the castle parking lot, and the small shuttle bus to the castle itself.” – Erin of Erin At Large  “The Schloss Neuschwanstein dates back to the 19th century and was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who didn’t live to see the final result of his vision: one of the most beautiful castles in the world. Surrounded by hills and lakes, it seems to be straight out of a fairytale, and many claim it actually served as Walt Disney’s inspiration for Cinderella’s Castle. If you want to visit the inside, make sure to buy your tickets online as soon as possible, as spots are limited. The visit consists of a guided tour that lasts around half an hour and costs 13€. Nevertheless, you can spend a whole day exploring the Castle’s area without even getting inside. With stunning viewpoints and stunning nature all around, there is plenty to do and see.” – Maria and Rui from Two Find A Way  “Neuschwanstein Castle is the dreamiest castle I’ve been to, both from the outside and inside. More than 1.3 million people visit this fairytale castle each year in the municipality of Schwangau in Bavaria. Since it’s such a popular tourist attraction it’s possible to go here from several German cities, but the most common starting point is probably Munich, which is a 1 hour and 45 minutes drive away from the castle. There is also a regular bus operated by Flixbus, and then of course you can always rent a car and drive there on your own, or join a group tour. If you want the best experience possible, I suggest an overnight stay at Hotel Müller Hohenschwangau, and then wake up early to avoid the crowds. From the bus stop, you can either walk for about 20-30 minutes uphill or take a shuttle bus. Also, don’t forget to continue beyond the castle and walk to the Marienbrucke (Queen Mary’s Bridge) where you get the iconic view over the castle. For those of you who also want to take a nice Instagram photo, keep walking beyond the bridge as well and follow the path uphill, it’s less crowded and offer a great selfie opportunity.” – Alex of Swedish Nomad “Rötteln Castle is a beautiful 11th century ruined castle in the far south-west corner of Baden-Württemberg, near the Swiss border. Known as Röttler Schloss by the locals, it was in continuous use from the time it was built until the 17th century. However, the castle was destroyed during the Franco-Dutch war in 1678. It was then quarried for stone, but restoration efforts over the 20th century have now brought it back to the state it was in at the time of its destruction. The castle stands on a hill about 400m above sea level, and the views alone are enough reason to visit. From the top of the keep, there are absolutely stunning vistas out over the ruins of the castle and the surrounding valley. There is plenty of exploring to be done around the ruins. If you get hungry, there is also a very cute and reasonably priced Biergarten serving up traditional German fare.  Rötteln Castle makes a great excursion if you are visiting the Swiss city of Basel – especially if Swiss prices are hurting your budget as entry is only €2.50 per adult. To get there on public transport, cross-border trains leave from Basel Badischer Bahnhof (German railway station) in the north of the city. Get off at Lörrach Haagen/Messe. From there, its either a 30 minute walk or a short taxi ride to the castle.” – Sarah of Trip Gourmets  “Hohenschwangau is a 19th century castle in Southern Germany. It’s located nearby the fairytale castle of Neuschwanstein, and it was also the childhood residence of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. This castle is not as famous as the Neuschwanstein Castle but it’s still worth a visit because it’s very beautiful as well. Hohenschwangau Castle was built by King Ludwig’s II father, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, who primarily used this as a summer and hunting residence. It was also here that King Ludwig II moved into his father’s room in the castle, back in 1864 upon his death. He continued to live here after his father’s death together with his mother, Queen Marie.About 300 000 people visit this castle each year, and you can buy a combination ticket together with your Neuschwanstein Castle ticket, which is highly recommended if you do an overnight stay or come here early in the morning and have time for both castles. The most common starting point is Munich, just about 1 hour and 40 minutes away by car. It’s also possible to get here by bus. But renting a car is recommended as there are many beautiful places nearby, and then you have the freedom to go and leave whenever you feel like instead of having to wait for a bus. Hohenschwangau Castle is open from 09:00 to 18:00 from April to September, and during winter it’s open between 10:00 to 16:00. Guided tours are provided in various languages such as English, Spanish, Russian, Japanese etc.” – Christine of Christine Abroad  “The small town of Heidelberg is one of the most romantic places to visit in Germany with its pretty landscape and gorgeous old town. While you visit Heidelberg, the most impressive sight without doubt is Heidelberg Castle situated on a hilltop. Heidelberg Castle was built in the 15th century, and it was unfortunately partially destroyed in the war against France in the 19th century. The castle was extended in several steps and contains elements from different architectural periods. Although the castle was partially destroyed, it’s still a very picturesque sight, which, in addition, offers fascinating views of Heidelberg and the Neckar River. During your visit to the castle, you will have the chance to visit a small winery and also an interesting Pharmacy Museum that exhibits objects from old pharmacies. How to get there: Heidelberg is easily accessible by train from either Frankfurt Airport or either Frankfurt Airport. Heidelberg Castle, situated on top of a hill can be accessed on foot or in a funicular.” – Gabor of Surfing The Planet  “Schloss Nordkirchen is the largest, and perhaps most impressive, moated castle in the German state of NorthRhine-Westphalia. Not only does the size make it stand out, but its symmetrical Baroque style does as well. Modeled after the Palace of Versaille, it is often called the Versaille of Westphalia. It differs from Versaille though, because of the surrounding double moat. The Schloss was originally designed as a grand residence to house the entire court of the Prince Bishopric of Münster. Building commenced in 1703, taking over 30 years to complete. The Church sold the castle centuries ago, and it has changed hands several times since, being owned by the state now, and used as a living quarters and training facility for government financial officers. The grounds surrounding the castle fill 170 hectares, with a combination of formal manicured gardens, tree lined corridors, wooded sections, and even a wildlife park. The entire area richly decorated with statues and busts which vary dramatically in style and make quite an eclectic mix. The grounds at Schloss Nordkirchen are free to visit. There is an open air cafe in the interior courtyard, and an indoor restaurant at moat level. The interior of the Schloss is only available through a guided tour that includes the Jupiter Hall, the Casino Room, and the Chapel of Assumption. The Schloss is located about 35 km south of Münster via the K2.” – Roxanna of Gypsy With A Day Job If you’re visiting Berlin and don’t want to stray away from the city check out Charlottenburg palace in the neighborhood of the same name. The inside is lavishly decorated in baroque and rococo styles and is surrounded by a baroque style garden. The palace and gardens are gorgeous during the day and especially at night, particularly during the holidays when the castle plays host to one of the city’s most famous Christmas markets. The nearest U-Bahn stop is Richard-Wagner-Platz and tickets to tour the inside can be purchased onsite.  “Nymphenburg Palace is located right inside Munich and is just as stunning as the ones that you will travel hours from the city to see – and it is so easy to get to! The construction of Nymphenburg Palace was started in 1664 after the birth of Maximilian II Emanuel and was completed in 1675. Like many beautiful palaces or castles it was added to by all monarchs that lived there until it is what we see today. We have visited the palace in 3 different seasons and I can tell you they are all as stunning as the one before but I must admit seeing it covered in snow was my absolute favourite. In the summer the sun beating down on the red roof of the palace is amazing, and everyone is sitting enjoying the gardens or going for a run through them. In the winter the canals that lead up to the palace can be used for ice skating. The inside of the Palace is beautiful and it is hard to believe that someone once called it home. The gold trimmings in the rooms shine in the sunlight that streams through the large windows and in the winter they shine with the glow from the lights. You can also go into some other buildings and see some of the royal carriages that were used by the Royal family located in the Marstall Museum. There are beautiful to see in any season!” Bec of WYLD Family Travel “Am I still in Germany?” I asked myself as I stepped into the lush green park of Bad Muskau. It felt more like a grand English country house estate, straight out of a scene from Downton Abbey. Indeed, a kind of English atmosphere was exactly what the designer wished to encapsulate. The eccentric Prince Hermann Ludwig Heinrich von Pückler-Muskau was the ambitious project manager of Bad Muskau. The count wanted to create the perfect 19th century English garden. Bad Muskau is on the German/Polish border. After World War II the area was altered significantly once more. The park was divided as the River Neisse was the official border between the two countries. For years the park lay in disarray due to the new political border. After German reunification, Poland and Germany worked together to restore Bad Muskau to its former glory. Bad Muskau stands proudly once again and is one of the few UNESCO sites which straddles two countries. Hire a bike for the day and explore the lovely grounds around the castle. Start in the traditional English park on the German side then cycle over the river Neisse to explore the wilder woodland on the Polish side. The English bridge connects the two parts of the park creating a wonderful cross-country collaboration. After you have finished admiring Saxony’s pink castle you can cycle to the nearby Devil’s bridge in the Rhododendron gardens to gaze upon a truly spectacular site. Enjoy a perfect day of cycling and exploring Bad Muskau Castle.” – Anna of My Travel Scrapbook Out of 20,000 castles in Germany it’s not easy to narrow it down – but these are our favorites for their dreaminess, style, and originality. I’m still on the hunt for more, so if you have any to add, let us know in the comments! Great list and always like when you corroborate with other bloggers like this. My friend who is living in Germany had listed two other castles on her site that looked kind of neat: 1. Coburg Castle (Coburg, Germany): Martin Luther supposedly did some translation of the Bible here and it has a great art collection. Plus it is pretty and huge.2. Castle Hotel Colmberg: 13th century castle. This one is not the prettiest, but unique. But what makes it neat is that it is now a hotel. The castle is preserved, but you get to “live in a castle” and explore it at your leisure.  It is on a pretty hill, but all of them are I imagine! Have you been to either of these? No I haven’t but they both sound cool! Great list, after living in Germany 3.5 years I’m ashamed to say I haven’t been to most on this list but will now have to plan some weekend road trips. I’d also add Buckeburg Palace (near Hannover) and Schwerin (in Schwerin) ? Thanks for those! I haven’t been to most of them either and I’ve lived here on and off for longer so don’t feel bad! Casle Neuschwanstein and Castle Heidelberg are my favorites.  I loved your post. There is only one thing I don’t agree with: there are lots and lots of castles in Saxony!Around Dresden, for example, there is not only Moritzburg, but also Königstein, Albrechtsburg Meissen, Weesenstein, Augustusburg, Pillnitz, Stolpen, Hohnstein, Großsedlitz, Rammenau – all of which I warmly recommend to visit. And then there are countless smaller castles – I would guess as many as one “Schloss” or “Burg” (or at least “Rittergut”) in every two dozen villages. Not all of these however are available for tourism as many are privately owned (castle Scharfenberg, Schloss Kuckuckstein for example) or used as hospitals (Sonnenstein castle in Pirna) or for other purposes. Many of them are, sadly, in bad repair and could be torn down. I think some of the best castles in Germany lie beyond the Oder-Neisse Rivers or in Saxon Transylvania Many built by the Teutonic Knights those in Poland were all in Grermany up until 1945 and historically should be included.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-lapland/,13 Reasons to Visit Finnish Lapland,Finland,"Before I finally resolved to visit more cold spots this winter, fully experiencing my first winter of life (at 29 years old, I know. I’m late), I realized that it’s actually one of my favorite seasons.  There are so many things that you can only do when it’s really, truly cold outside, and Finnish Lapland is the perfect place to do them all. From playing in the snow to all of the adrenaline activities and cool things that you can do either solo or with friends, I was really impressed by the offerings there and found myself fantasizing about renting a little cottage there next winter, just so that I can ski on those uncrowded slopes and stare up at the sky hoping for aurora borealis.  Here are 13 things I tried and that I have a feeling you’ll love to when you visit Lapland: I’ve wanted to try this trick ever since seeing it on YouTube. If you’re somewhere cold enough, you can actually throw boiling water into the air and it will immediately turn into icy vapor. It feels like a magic trick! It got down to -27 C°/-16.6 F° while I was in Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland, so it was just cold enough to work. Tip: Try throwing a small amount away from you first to make sure it’ll actually work so that you don’t burn yourself if it’s not cold or dry enough. I visited two ice hotels while I was in Finnish Lapland – Snowman World in Rovaniemi, and Snow Village in Kittilä. What’s really cool about these is they change every year with new designs and ice sculptures. It takes a team of 30-ish people about two weeks to build them, and each was so big that it had at least a dozen or so themed rooms, plus an ice bar, restaurant, and snow art. Snow Village even had a church where several people have gotten married this year: In Lapland, snowmobiling is a way of getting from point A to B. Plenty of locals use snowmobiles as their main mode of transport in the winter, which I found pretty cool! You can even do multi-day explorations heading all the way into Sweden or Norway, which I’d love to try out next time I’m in the ‘hood. It’s pretty easy to drive the snowmobiles, and they’re quite stable as well. I took one out on a frozen lake in Rovaniemi with Lapland Safaris (who have a location in Ylläsjärvi as well) and totally had the hang of it after a couple of minutes. If you’ve ever driven a motorbike, you’ll find this to be even easier.  Dog-sledding is actually a tradition from North America, but naturally it took me heading to the other side of the world to give it a try. The conditions in Lapland are perfect for the dogs, who do best in solid, dry snow, which occurs when it’s particularly cold outside. If you’ve interacted much with Huskies then you’ll know how energetic they are. These guys were absolutely dying to run, and it was surprisingly peaceful, which I didn’t expect, to be on the back of their sled. Finland is one of the safest countries in the world, particularly Lapland, so it’s no big deal to just go for a hike with some snow shoes on (you know, so you don’t just sink right into the thigh-deep snow) and go for a nighttime walk. I did so several times when I was there and it was so peaceful, I didn’t really want to leave. The Finnish sauna is a huge part of the culture and to be honest, the thought of going into a little wooden room and sweating my brains out didn’t appeal, but I suppose that’s because it wouldn’t appeal in the warm climate I come from. When it’s crisp and cold outside, though, it’s wonderful. At the ski resort in Ylläs, you can actually rent a sauna gondola and afterwards you can drink beer, go in the jacuzzi outside, and use the other sauna inside as well. It doesn’t make much sense financially for one or two people but with a group of 12 and 4 trips around on the gondola, plus the VIP room inside, it’s actually a really cool idea and only costs €100 each. Contact them here if it piques your interest. I almost refused to run outside and jump into the hole cut in the ice of the lake after my first sauna, but this is the other part of the coin when it comes to Finnish tradition. After the extreme heat, you have to experience the extreme cold, then heat up again after and repeat. Some people jump into an ice lake, others roll in the snow. I ended up doing both and I felt so relaxed after, it’s actually something I’d do now without hesitation. It’s mainly praised for its detox benefits, but athletes even use this method for endurance training! (Note: This is not for people with heart problems). One of the most exciting things for me about visiting Lapland was that I would get to see what I call the who-ville trees. They’re tall, thin trees that have ice caked to their branches and at certain altitudes, they look other-worldly. In Äkäslompolo, a village near the Ylläs ski resort, you can get high enough to see them and even hike through them at night. Several are lit up and they’re quite cool-looking. The Ylläs ski resort had some really nice slopes, mainly because they go through those really cool trees, and there’s so much snow! I also had a few runs where I didn’t see another person my whole ride down. I was also able to do four red runs in Ylläs, officially graduating from the blues I had been on when I learned how to ski in Austria just a week earlier. Skiing down those dreamy, wide, powdery slopes in Finland without the crowds gave me such a great opportunity to keep learning. If you’re more into nordic skiing or snowboarding, you can do both there as well. Backcountry skiing and boarding are also popular there for the more advanced guys. The people who live in Lapland used to use reindeer as their main mode of transport. The animals gave, and still do give, a lot to the local people in terms of food, warm clothing from their hides, and even tools from the antlers, which they lose and re-grow every year. I loved learning that the reindeer are actually semi-wild, and each winter they voluntarily return to their ‘home’ stables because they know they can find food there. In the spring and summer, they live out in the forest where they forage and give birth to their young. It’s never a guarantee that you’ll see the Northern Lights, of course, but Finnish Lapland is one of the main places where people go to catch them. I got a bit unlucky with the weather and had cloud cover for most of the trip, but thankfully at around 12 midnight on my second-to-last night there, the clouds cleared and there was a little bit of aurora activity! That’s something you never get tired of seeing. (If you want to see more aurora photos check out my Iceland photography) Betcha didn’t know, Santa’s official hometown is in Rovaniemi, Finland. You can visit him for free if you want (but photos with him do cost €). I noticed thanks to the celebrity wall that Conan O’Brien did. I’m sure I’m firmly on the wall as well now X-D It’s so snowy everywhere in Lapland, and there’s plenty of hours of darkness, so you can try the steel wool trick without risking burning down a forest. Step one, tear off a piece of steel wool. Step two, insert into an egg beater. Step three, tie a string to it so that you can swing it around. Step four, cover your head and arms. Step 5, light it on fire and spin it around. It’s how I get my kicks!  Have you been to Lapland or tried any of these? Would you add to the list? Let me know below! Do it yourself: *In the spirit of full disclosure, this post was brought to you thanks to Visit Finland and Visit Rovaniemi. The above thoughts are my own and you can always trust that I will never promote something I don’t love.  Great post! I had the chance to spend a few days in Finnish Lapland during the summer, and it’s a completely different experience — hiking with husky puppies instead of dogsledding; driving without headlights at 1 a.m.; enjoying an outdoor meal on a lumberjack island at midnight, without any artificial lights. But Santa was still there, even in July. Can’t wait to go back in winter! You may have seriously just made up my mind on where to go next winter. I’ve had several trips I’ve thought about making in December/January and Lapland might just push them all aside! You’re right, winter is just magical, and I think it’s so cool that you didn’t just go in with preconceived notions about winter and hate it on principle. You’re one of the few travel bloggers who have really gone into depth about winter, so I hope you continue going cold places! Whoa. Another awesome post. Love those trees. I love light painting too, need to still try that steel wool. Looks like you found the perfect spot to do it in. Definitely a great spot. You can’t burn anything down accidentally with the sparks when it’s all covered in snow! so true! just true! Lapland is a place of silence and dreams come true… I’ve had the absolute pleasure of visiting kitilla twice and I must say it’s my favourite place in the world! Everything about Lapland is just magical!! I’d giv anything to spend a few days there. My children loved it too! Once we were there we didn’t wanna leave!! I definitely want to go back too! It really is magical. You stirred my wanderlust in this post! So beautiful! Hi Kristen I’ve just been to Norway which is just as fab as Finland. I’d like to visit both in the summer to get a different perspective and see the midnight sun. Happy travelsKaren x What place did you stay at? Aurora Estate which is linked in the bottom of the post now. Thanks for asking 🙂 HiLoved the video and blog on Lapland.You said you did the above in a week.Did you stay in Aurora Estate Yllas for the whole week? If yesAre the other areas easy to drive to? How far between main capital Rovaniemi to Yllas and snow village etc?I’m decided on Levi or Yllas to stay and if they are close to each other than it doesn’t matter.Thanks Rachel I flew into Rovaniemi where I stayed for one day before driving to Yllas which was a few hours. You could also just fly there directly. I stayed at Aurora for 5 or 6 days and most of the activities listed I did within 10-20 minutes of Aurora Estate 🙂 Hi I just want to ask where do you book the activities? And how much does it cost?? I’d book them with the individual companies that I linked in the post 🙂 Lapland looks absolutely stunning. Thanks for sharing these photos. Enjoyed this post, makes me consider another place to visit, especially with companions who want to first try out “safe” countries while having loads of winter fun!  The video was awesome and was such a great example of corroboration. Those people who make the ice sculptures and hotel are amazing and winter started late that year too, so they had to work fast. The boiling water trick is great. It has become a real craze this winter being so cold in the States. Here are some helpful hints on that for others for those of us sometimes lacking the common sense gene (me included sometimes!):1. Throw the water away from you, not above you or onlookers, and beware of onlookers! (e.g., I saw a You Tube video of someone tossing it off an upper floor apartment balcony, don’t do that! 🙂 ).2. Don’t think of doing this with cold water, it won’t work (the mist from vapor exposes each vapor molecule to the full extent of the cold, larger surface area, so then freezes on this by contact).3. Beware that any of the vapor that doesn’t freeze, strangely enough, is still very hot, so you can have ice next to hot water in same plume!4. If there is any wind, stand upwind of where you are going to toss (wind blowing on your back ideally even though when this cold, often there is no wind)!5. Make sure you know the temperature for sure when doing it and it is below the temps Kristin suggested (-26C, -17F!) and dress appropriately (this is for those living in areas in the States that rarely experience these cold temperatures currently going on!). Thanks for the tips! You’re welcome. And to correct myself since I should be quoting someone else accurately even if one degree off, she suggested -27C, -17F! (although also take her advice to test it with a small amount first since it is a play on temp and humidity!) To clarify, I mean even if I’m only one degree off. hi  im planing on going finland lapland next year for northern light hunting.  march its the best date to visit?its still snowing on march? planing on skiing too Each year is different so it’s hard to say definitively if it’s snowing or if the lights will be out, but March should be a good time to go. I went at the end of January and it was uncharacteristically warm so the sky was cloudy, but still great skiing! Hi! Loved the video and the post 🙂I’m traveling next month and i have some douths about driving in the snow. Do you have any tips or advices?Also driving time does it take much longer due to the snow? I’m trying to calculate the time that would take me to go to one place to another.I’ll really apreciate if you see my comment 🙂 Hey Jessica. I get that. I’m from Southern California and driving in the snow terrifies me. I did have to do so in Alberta in the winter and I got a car with 4 wheel drive and winter tires. It helped me feel a little bit safer but yes I also drove pretty slowly, which I would highly recommend! Try to drive when there’s light as well.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/akaslompolo-yllas-finland/,Breathtaking Finland: Why Äkäslompolo and Ylläs are Must-Sees,Finland,"Finland is a rich country. What have they got? They got Nokia phones and plywood. How’d they get so rich? Because they’re free.P. J. O’Rourke Welcome to the Arctic Circle. Specifically, I’m speaking of Äkäslompolo, and the surrounding Ylläsjarvi, Kolari, and Ylläs ski resort in Finnish Lapland. The snow is of a different form here. Each flake is perfectly formed and it glitters when it catches the sun, or the beams of the a headlight. It billows down from the sky like a little flying seed from a dandelion – the kind that you blow on when you make a wish. It falls right into place as if it knows where it is meant to go. The snowflakes come together to build little blankets of powdered sugar, layer upon layer, like the sediments of a lake bed. They do this all over the ground, on every tree, every rock, every rooftop, and every fence post. I marvel as they stick to my camera on their way down. “They really do each have their own shape,” I keep saying in awe, “they’re so beautiful.” How have I lived my whole life without a real winter? I suddenly feel deprived rather than thinking smugly that I had the superior end of the stick by avoiding winters while growing up in Southern California. Yet while looking at this, I can imagine a reality where I spend every winter in this snow globe world. The winter in Finnish Lapland isn’t just any winter, though. It’s different to the apres-ski parties and giant slopes full of gondolas in Austria – which I love, too. But for those seeking something a little different, this is the place. Finnish Lapland is special because feels so incredibly secluded, so profoundly quiet, and so calmingly peaceful. It took coming here to understand what makes it so special, but I quickly realized that it’s a silence you can’t find just anywhere. I feel it in the desolate desert, at the peak of a hiking trail that nobody else is on, and now, in the quietness of a frosty forest. It’s in the ski slopes at Ylläs that are coated in clouds of snow, the cotton candy trees, the feeling of being the only one there. It’s like a storybook fantasy world adorned in white and it’s so calming, you wonder for a moment if you could happily just remain there forever. I know that in some part of the world it’s summer and there are warm beaches and sand so hot it burns your feet when you walk on it, but I don’t yearn for that at all in this sparkling white paradise. The areas of Ylläs, Äkäslompolo, and the surroundings are just like the documentaries about the Arctic that I used to watch on TV years ago and think to myself that nothing could be that secluded yet simultaneously accessible by humans. Now I know, oh but it can! The very idea of -30 degrees used to be terrifying to me, but then I realized that it was just simple fear, and in actuality it’s not that scary to be so cold. It’s actually a blessing. Where else do you get the stillness, the crispness of the air, the indescribable pinkness of the sun, and the kind of snowflake that crackles like poprocks on your tongue when you lick it? Enjoying it is not complicated with the right outfit choice. In reality, the snowy surroundings are yours without much discomfort. In most of the world, people loathe the winter, but here, Locals will say its their favorite season and I can understand why. The Arctic winter offers a beautiful stillness, and an endless sunset as the sun just rests on the horizon for hours, never fully rising. Plus, there’s an incredible amount of things to do there. You can Nordic ski, snow-shoe (day or night, it’s no problem), hunt for the Northern Lights, ride on the back of a husky or reindeer sleigh, go snowmobiling, or my personal favorite, Alpine skiing. Then after it all, when you come home to a cozy BnB with a reindeer steak waiting for you, you realize winter brings with it some special methods of enjoyment. Like a sauna followed by a dip in ice water, and a glass of champagne in a hot tub thereafter. Where else can you fully enjoy 40-degree water while the stars come out and the snow falls around you? So if you’re like me and the very thought of winter scares you, I bet this will change your mind completely. Finland, thanks for showing me that winter is wonderful, too. You opened up my eyes to so many travel possibilities with just one trip. Do it yourself: *In the spirit of full disclosure, this post was brought to you thanks to Visit Finland and Visit Ylläs. The above thoughts are my own and you can always trust that I will never promote something I don’t love.  Absolutely loving the increase in posts! All your talk of snow and skiing is making me seriously consider skiing in certain countries when I start travelling in August. I haven’t skied in about a decade and I’ve missed it so much lately, and I imagine countries like Nepal would be amazing for it! Finland looks bloody beautiful.. I never realised Lapland was actually a place, and it really does look like a fairytale world! P.s. I’m very excited for your Patagonia posts 🙂 I don’t know of ski resorts in Nepal but maybe there is something! If not, the Alps are always divine and who knew Finland was such a great place too? So much snow! I know India has a few resorts in the Himalayas, and there’s the Japanese Alps. So much potential to ski! I thought Patagonia might have some too? There’s one spot in Bariloche but after looking at the lifts, I think I’ll stick to Europe. Yay your Finland  posts! Your winter posts are amazing, this is exactly how I feel about winter. I’ve found a lot of people have this mental block about winter, whether they’ve really experienced it before or not. I’m not sure why some people and cities are like that when other people in other cities love winter and really do it up right. Obviously it doesn’t just depend on where you live but some places really do seem to appreciate winter more than others. I was surprised when all of the people I met in Lapland told me winter is their favorite season, and one guy who lives in Scotland now comes home specifically for winter! I totally get it, it’s otherworldly there with all that snow and the stillness and clarity. Glad you liked Finland! One of the best things about this country is how it’s so scarcely inhabited that you can get that feeling of peace and isolation anywhere in the country. I gotta admit that even I haven’t even been norther than Rovaniemi and even though I would love love love to visit those areas, I could never actually live there. Winters here in southern Finland are a bit more shit but mostly the temperatures stay above -10 C so I’m happy with that (y) Since it’s a dry cold it was ok with me! Plus, the possibility of northern lights is huge for me. These pictures are absolutely beautiful! I’ve only ever been to Helsinki (and that was in the summer), but Finnish Lapland looks absolutely breathtaking. I don’t consider myself a winter person, but I might be willing to make an exception for something like this. 🙂 I didn’t think I was either, then I realized I never understood what winter really is. It can be just as fun and beautiful as a sunny beach – they’re just different and both are great. This. is. heaven. I love Finland, I’ve only visited the southern part around Helsinki and Lahti, but coming back to explore the north has been on my list ever since I came back home. Your post made me want to book a flight immediately, haha, wish I didn’t have school to finish this spring 😀 I’d love to check out the southern part as well! So much beauty there. Wow! I’m completing my first atw trip and already adding new places like this to my bucket list. Your photos look stunning here. Winter agrees with you! The scenery looks amazing. Finnish Lapland looks like an absolute winter wonderland and a wonderful place to be active. Wow! Finland never stops on  impressing me. It seems like I have a new destination to travel.  The places are much more exciting. Same I had no idea that I would love it so much there. Hi! Can you tell me more about driving on the road in the middle of winter? We are planning to go to the same area early January next year and are planning to rent a car. What will the road condition be like and will it be dark most of the time? Thanks! I was there in January too. The sun came up around 10am and went down around 4pm. Not too bad. It’s snowy for sure but there aren’t many cars on the road and if you have a solid vehicle and experience should be OK Thanks for the reply, Kristin! May I ask where is the scenic drive near Akaslompolo mentioned in your article? It’s the name of the street that runs from one ski area to the other Can you please show me the location of the scenic drive near Akaslompolo? I cannot find it on google map. How long was the trail and how long did it tale to snowshoe there? Hi! Can you share what type of jacket did you wear that kept you warm in Finland in January? Here you go: http://amzn.to/1NExLzp (this one is very similar) I just read your post and fell in love! I was in Finland last year and your words say everything I wanted to say about that country, especially the north … It’s definitely the perfect place! Yay glad you connected with what I wrote! It’s so magical there. We love Äkäslompolo and it’s become a New Year tradition for us. We’ll be heading out there in a month for the fourth year in a row, this time with the novelty of an excited nephew coming with us 🙂 Oh how nice! It’s magical there I want to go back.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ski-trip-packing-list/,The Ideal Ski Trip Packing List,Finland,"This winter, for the first time, I learned how to ski and most importantly, how to avoid turning into an icicle while doing so. I didn’t go skiing or experience snow when I was growing up, save for a few times when I was too young to really remember it. I had to ask a lot of questions about how to prepare and what to bring when I did start to put together my ski trip packing list. Everyone who grew up in a place with seasons finds this hilarious but I genuinely did not understand winter prior to experiencing it firsthand and making a few blunders, such as underdressing for the cold, over the course of January. However, I learned that even in -30 temperatures, with the right clothing just about any type of weather is doable and even if you’re buying a new winter wardrobe like I was, it doesn’t have to break the bank. I think I’ve got it down now, so without further ado, Your Ski Jacket is worth spending some money on in order to get something of quality. In all of my winter packing lists, I suggest spending money on shoes and jackets and going cheap on the rest if you’re on a budget. Ideally the ski jacket will be completely water-proof and will last several seasons. Remember the saying, “buy cheap, buy twice.” Mine is North Face brand (their designs are changing all the time, so this is a link to something similar to what I have but not the exact same), so it’s great quality and has lots of pockets for the ski pass, cameras, and my phone, as well as reflectors for night skiing and a bright color so that I’m easily visible on the slopes. The boots you wear when you’re not skiing are important, too. There are tons of other activities to check out when you’re on a ski trip that you’ll want good shoes for, like snow-shoeing, sledding (which requires that you use your feet as bakes), and even just walking around. They should be super warm and also waterproof. I’ve had the same pair for years now and even deep below freezing temperatures, with the right socks, they keep me warm and dry. Mine are Ugg brand and here is a similar and well-reviewed pair from Sorel as well. Your gloves are super important too, because if you’re like me, your hands and toes are the first parts of you to get cold almost immediately. I was pretty stoked to find a pair that normally retails for $99 for only $26, and can report that they served me well during my ski trip. Make your first base layer something pretty warm and resilient but not bulky. This is useful all winter long and I wear it all the time. I have a merino wool layer that’s functional and practical and that’s the most important thing in cold temperatures. Thankfully, this type of wool isn’t itchy for me as I usually have problems with wool.  The rest, I bought super cheap and used multiple times. Here’s the full ski packing list:   Since I’d never been skiing before, it didn’t make sense to me to buy the skis, ski boots, and poles before being sure that I liked the sport. I’d suggest just renting these on the ground once you get to where you’re going if you’re also new. That way, you can make sure you like the sport before investing in expensive gear. Most of the items listed above, however, are useful for winter sports in general. Happy skiing! This is really helpful! I’ll know exactly what to get when I (finally) go on a ski trip. Maybe next winter 🙂 🙂 This is a fantastic list! My daughter and i took a ski trip last year for New Years and what a DISASTER!  I wish I had had this list then.  We vowed (coming from Texas) that we would never do a winter holiday again..since then we have done our best to agree to try once again with the correct attire.  Thanks for all your posts Kristin they truly are an inspiration to me.  Stay warm 🙂 People with winter experience laugh at me because I’m such a newbie but honestly without anyone telling you or without firsthand experience, how are you supposed to know what to wear?! Glad you found this helpful! It really was totally fine and I was warm enough, even later when I visited Finland where it was -27, with the right clothes on 🙂 Thanks for posting this list! I’m actually moving to Finland in a few weeks time (yay!) And I know from when I visited last year, I did not have the correct clothing (I’m Australian so never really had winter before!) and I was freezing most of the time! I was wondering with the pants you linked to, were they true to size? Some of the reviews say the sizing is a bit off for them… Thanks again for posting this, it will be so helpful for me! I am thinking about going on a guided ski trip in the alps for the first time in my life. It is a daunting experience since I have not gone on a trip like this before. Knowing these tips, like to make the base layer warm but not bulky gives me a little more confidence in myself. hi. i live my whole life in a tropical country. it’s gonna be my first time to drive a car on winter setting come end of this november till first week of december. do i need to use winter tires? YES, and 4 wheel drive too!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-rent-a-boat-in-greece/,A Guide to Renting a Boat in Greece,Greece,"Growing up, one of my best friends would go to Greece every summer to visit her grandparents. She told me all about how beautiful it was and in the years that followed, I saw photos around the Internet that confirmed her stories of brilliant sunsets over blue waters. For several years now we’ve been talking about how dreamy it would be to rent a boat and island-hop around some of the spots around Greece. I’d always assumed that it would be expensive or difficult to arrange, but this summer when we decided to make that dream a reality, it was surprisingly affordable and pretty easy to organize. If you’re looking at renting a boat and a skipper in Greece, the following are some of the best ways that you can do it, plus the method that we used: If you want to design your own experience from start to finish, the best way to go is to get a group together and rent your own boat. That’s exactly what I did – getting 7 friends together to rent a boat that could accommodate the 8 of us, plus a skipper. If you go this route, you’ll need to help the skipper a bit with crewing the boat, which we thought was a lot of fun. We used Sailways and spent about $600 per person for a week on a 50-foot sailboat. You can also try renting a boat with a website like BoatBookings. Decide if you want the boat crewed (operated by a whole team of people), skippered (sailed by a single professional), or sailed independently (you’ll need a license and experience to do this), and select either a motor yacht, a sailing yacht, or a catamaran. The website basically operates as an Airbnb for boats. BoatBookings takes pride in that it only works with reliable boat operators to ensure clients that their boat rental experience is completely safe and legitimate. The only downside is that the boats can be pricy (the lowest rentals starting in the thousands of dollars) as clients are paying for size and luxury. The Globe Sailor works the same way as BoatBookings, allowing you to choose your preferences for all options and detailing the accommodations and features of each boat. One small difference between the two is that Globe Sailor offers six different types of boats (five for Greece), as opposed to the three choices on BoatBookings. The company is run by a friendly 26-person team based in Paris; if you choose to rent a skippered boat, you’ll likely have one of these 26 sea experts as your guide! The website boasts “boat rentals at the best price,” which is actually true! I couldn’t find lower prices on any other site. In fact, plenty of the sailboats on the site cost less than $1,000 per week, with some sailboats available in other parts of Europe for as low as a few hundred dollars. The bottom line: Not everyone wants to orchestrate a whole trip, though. After all, it is no easy task to plan an international trip when both air and water transport are necessary! That said, I’ve put together a 7-day itinerary in 3 of the most popular sailing spots in Greece to make it easier. Still, for solo travelers, I know that getting a group together can be challenging. There are a few options out there if you’d like to join a chartered cruise as well: The Yacht Week is certainly one of the most popular options among young people for sailing the Mediterranean. Simply put, this is what you do if you want to party. The company runs skippered, week-long, pre-planned routes to six different destinations (five in the Mediterranean, all in the Balkans). It offers travelers two options: either book a full yacht for a private group of six to 12 people, or reserve a two-person cabin or solo spot on a shared yacht. Their route through Greece travels between a few locations on the Greek mainland and the Greek islands of Poros, Ermioni, Hydra, Spetses, and Dokos. Trip activities include a regatta, a daytime party, bay swims, four-wheeling, and a sunset dinner, and on all TYW trips, travelers have the perks of professional photographers, international DJs, and access to exclusive events. While it is perhaps the most glamorous of the Grecian boating options, it is important to note that The Yacht Week has a serious party vibe, so if you’re looking for a more relaxed adventure, this might not be the company for you. Also, a trip is pretty pricy: the Greek itinerary costs between $750 and $1,800, with the cheaper tickets omitting meals. Plus, the sticker price still does not include airfare, transportation to and from the port, eating out, and port fees. The bottom line: A trip with The Yacht Week is fun, glamorous, and geared toward a younger crowd; however, a 7-day trip is expensive, provides little freedom in choosing destinations or activities, and could be better adapted for solo travelers. Similar to The Yacht Week, MedSailors runs week-long, skippered, pre-planned sailing trips for a crowd between the ages of 20 and 35. It runs seven different routes, including two throughout Greece. (One Greek route travels through the Ionian islands; the other, the Saronic.) Guests can choose to travel on an eight-guest or ten-guest yacht or an eight-guest catamaran. What sets MedSailors apart is its outlook on travel, which is rooted in a combination of experiences: exploring nature and history, living like a local, spending some time enjoying the nightlife, and relaxing. MedSailors also makes a point to welcome solo travelers, as they aim to bunk an individual with another traveler of the same gender and roughly the same age who is looking for the same type of sailing experience. MedSailors even cares about the “Leave No Trace” environmental mantra, their website showing travelers participating in a beach cleanup. MedSailors itineraries are more inclusive than The Yacht Week, as the sticker price, ranging from $600 to $1,100, includes daily breakfast and lunch, snorkeling and paddleboarding equipment, and even the opportunity for sailing lessons from the skipper! Travelers must still pay for airfare, transportation, and restaurant dinners, though. The bottom line: While travelers still do not get to choose all the specifics of their itineraries, MedSailors forgoes a strong party vibe in favor of cultural authenticity, a comfortable setting for solo travelers, environmental responsibility, and a lower overall cost. That said, they still like to party on MedSailors, it’s just not the center of the trip. Whichever route you choose to go, it’s important to be prepared for the trip in a way that differs from other, non water-based trips: I hope this helps you to plan an amazing week sailing around Greece. I loved the flexibility, the affordability, and the experience of getting to do this with my friends in beautiful waters, eating great food. For help on planning your route, check out 3 itineraries I put together for the Cyclades, Saronic islands, and the Ionians. Happy sailing! It’s really amazing but the food is relatively higher costs. Hmm, relative to what? I think it’s pretty good compared to the rest of the Mediterranean. Interesting, this is a useful resource. Thanks for the information. Did renting your own skipper + boat really cost $600 per person per day? Doesn’t that make it more expensive than the organized Yacht week of $1,200 flat — or am I missing something? Nope thanks for catching that. It was supposed to say $600 total, not per day. Brain fart? I edited it!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sailing-greek-islands/,How to Spend 7 Days Island-Hopping in Greece,Greece,"Greece is the perfect combination of affordable, beautiful, and delicious. When it comes to sailing around the Mediterranean, Greece is what dreams are made of, and at a cheaper price than its French or Italian neighbors. This July, I went island-hopping in Greece with seven of my friends and it was so beautiful that we’re already planning our next island-hopping adventure for next summer. So that got me thinking, and researching, the best islands to pick for sailing around Greece. Because Greece is home to literally thousands of islands, the islands are organized into groupings called “island chains.” Two well-known island chains are the Cyclades, which includes Santorini and Mykonos, and the Ionians, which are just off the west coast of the Greek mainland. The Cyclades are made up of 56 islands and the Ionians, 12. Each island has its own unique history and topography, as well as a different array of attractions. We decided to do something a little different for our trip, and focused on the Saronic Gulf which is just off the mainland and features clear waters that are more like the Amalfi Coast in Italy. So with so many destinations to choose from, where does an aspiring island-hopper even start? To help you out, I put together a few 7-day Greek island-hopping itineraries for the Cyclades, Ionians, and Saronic Gulf to ensure that you enjoy the Greek islands to the fullest. The Cyclades, located off the southeast coast of Greece in the Aegean Sea, are known for their beauty, their traditional blue and white architecture (think Oia in Santorini pictured above), and their hospitable people. Legend has it that the Cyclades, which all circle around the central, sacred island of Delos, were once nymphs who angered Poseidon. It is only right that a 7-day Cyclades itinerary would include one of the more popular islands, so start your island-hopping adventure on Mykonos. Fly into JMK International Airport, which receives flights from many locations in Europe, as well as a few in the Middle East. Day 1: Spend your first day exploring Mykonos. Rent a Vespa or a quad to cruise around the island with, and hang out on one of the island’s beautiful beaches. Some beaches are calm and relaxed, while others have much more of a party vibe, so be sure to pick one that fits your style! When you’ve soaked up enough sun for one day, head out for a peaceful dinner and sunset. Finally, spend some time exploring Mykonos’ bustling nightlife. Day 2: Hang out on Mykonos for one more day. Check out the island’s iconic windmills, then head to the Aegean Maritime Museum to see fascinating Greek sailing artifacts. After that, explore the countless shops and markets in Mykonos Town, then relax on another beach! Day 3: Time for a new island! Sail to Naxos, the largest of the Cyclades islands. Naxos is special because it prospers more from traditional agriculture than it does from tourism, so be sure to really soak in the authentic culture of the island. The best way to do this: explore all Naxos has to offer, from its rugged mountains and deep gorges to hilltop villages and old churches. For example, hike Mount Zas, the highest peak in the Cyclades, or visit the 6th century Panagia Drosiani church. Take time to shop your way through the island’s boutiques and market, too. Day 4: Don’t worry, it’s not time to leave Naxos just yet. Spend your second day on the island doing something adventurous, like snorkeling or windsurfing at one of the many beaches. Finish the day by dining at the harbor and watching the sun set behind the marble frame of Portara, the unfinished remnants of a 6th-century temple of Apollo. Day 5: Say goodbye to Naxos and sail to its next-door neighbor, Paros, which is known for clear sea waters and traditional villages. Start by exploring the port of Parikia, home to winding streets and whitewashed cubic architecture. Here, you will also find Panagia Ekatontapiliani, or “The Church of 100 Doors,” which dates back to the 4th century. Then, check out the Valley of the Butterflies, a natural park where thousands of butterflies gather in the summer. Day 6: On your second day on Paros, head up to the village of Lefkos, which doesn’t get much tourism. Take the time to stop into a bakery and admire the blue and white buildings which make up authentic Greek island culture. Spend the afternoon on one of Paros’ great beaches, many of which are complete with loungers and restaurants or bars. Alternatively, skip Paros and head to Santorini. Though Santorini is the most popular of the Cyclades, it does not have a port where sailing ships can dock. However there are boat transfers to the island from the neighboring ones. If you really want to sail and spend your time on the boat, I recommend finishing up the cruise, then heading to Santorini for a few days once you’re done. Day 7: To finish off your Cyclades trip, sail back to Mykonos, from which you can fly home. The Ionian Islands are located in the Ionian Sea, just off the west coast of Greece. 6 large islands and 6 small islands make up the chain of 12 Ionians, which have the deepest waters in the Mediterranean. Many of the islands were once part of the Greek mainland, but sunk into the ocean after a series of earthquakes along a fault in the Ionian Sea. The islands experience strong wind currents, making them internationally acclaimed windsurfing destinations. The Ionians boast a very different style than the Cyclades. In fact, their sharply structured buildings in hues of orange and yellow make them look more like Italy’s Amalfi Coast than the traditional blue and white hilltop villages of other Greek islands. To start your Ionian island-hopping, fly into Preveza’s Aktion National Airport, in western Greece. (This airport connects to Israel and most major cities in Europe.) Your first destination, the island of Lefkada is only a short drive away. (Lefkada, also called Lefkas, is so close to the mainland that there is a road connecting the two.) Day 1: Spend the first day of the Ionian trip exploring Lefkada. Start by descending the nearly 350 steps from the towering seaside bluffs to Egremni Beach, a white pebble beach on bright blue waters, far beneath. Or, head to Mikros Gialos Beach and rent a canoe to explore the turquoise cove. These are just two of the many beaches on Lefkada, so you will have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the sun and sea. However, some of the beaches are gravelly, so be sure to wear flip flops. Stay at the Allure, a fun and modern boutique hotel. Day 2: A second day on Lefkada gives you more time to be adventurous. Try windsurfing at the Vassiliki resort! (But go earlier in the day if you’ve never been windsurfing before, as the winds get stronger as the day goes on.) If you’d prefer to stay on land, there is ample opportunity to mountain bike around the island, as much of Lefkada is rocky and mountainous. For something calmer, follow the beautiful hike from the town of Nydri through citrus and olive trees to the Nydri waterfalls. Day 3: On the third day of the trip, sail to the petite island of Paxos, which is a bit northwest of Lefkada. If you plan accordingly, you can attend the Paxos Festival taking place each summer, where you’ll see upcoming international and Greek musicians in the jazz, classical, and folk genres. But for the rest of the year, there is still lots to enjoy on Paxos. The island is the perfect size to explore on foot, as there is enough to see that you won’t get bored, but not so big that you’ll get lost. Plenty of markers and signposts lead visitors through hikes around the island, too. Be sure to see the stunning multi-hued blue water at Kipiadi beach. Day 4: For a second day on Paxos, begin by visiting Tripitos Arch, the remnants of a collapsed sea cave, or the Blue Caves, hollowed-out limestone sea caves on the island’s west coast. (Note, though, that the Blue Caves are only accessible by boat.) When you get hungry, work your way through the dozens of cafes at the fishing port of Gaios. Finally, soak up the sun at Mongonissi Beach, the island’s only beach with sand, rather than pebbles or gravel. Day 5: Come day five, leave Paxos to sail north to Corfu, the second largest Ionian island. Corfu is unique because it was under Venetian, French, and British control before it became part of Greece in the 19th century. Therefore, its architecture and monuments reflect its complex past. Begin by exploring Old Town, which allows visitors to see the heavy Venetian influence on the island. Check out the 16th century Renaissance church St. Spyridon or the 13th century Paleokastritsa Monastery, where you can be taken on a tour by one of the eight monks who live there. Day 6: Spend another day on Corfu by snorkeling in the clear waters at Paleokastritsa Beach or swimming through the stone tunnel at Canal d’Amour Beach. (Note the French name!)For a last little bit of history, visit the 13th century Angelokastro Castle, which was the clifftop capital of Corfu for several hundred years up until the 16th century. Day 7: On your last day, sail back to Lefkada and return to Aktion Airport to complete your island-hopping trip. In contrast to the other options on this list, the Saronic Gulf boasts both clear water and colorful buildings, combining some of the charming elements of the other two itineraries but without as many visitors. The benefit of the Saronics over the Cyclades is the opportunity to stay closer to Athens, in case members of your group need to leave at different times, and to have closer stops than the Ionians, which are huge islands that can be quite far apart. Day 1: Depart from Piraeus in the afternoon and make your way as far as winds allow. That might mean stopping as close as Aegina or making your way to what was our first stop for the night, Methana. Once a popular town with bougie tourists, this spot has since lost most of its tourism and become somewhat of a ghost town. That means this will be the quietest stop of your voyage. It also has hot springs which are worth checking out. Day 2: Our first major stop was Ermioni, which is still on the mainland and offers a combination of beautiful clear water and a path with pine trees to walk through. I loved this charming town with delicious food and beautiful swimming. Day 3: Make your way early in the day to the island of Hydra, which is famous for its quaint, C-shaped harbor and beautiful clear water. Lounge on the rocks above the water and jump in, hang out with the many cats who make the island their home, and head up to the fort after dark for photo ops. Days 4-5: Next, make your way to Poros, which is the perfect stop to spend a couple of days. If you have an international license, rent quad bikes and explore the highest point of the island and its many beaches. Alternatively, take a 6-Euro cab to Russian Bay for some of the world’s best souvlaki – seriously. From there make your way back on foot past Love Bay to the port. Be sure to check out the alleyways through town for some white, cobblestone stairs and beautiful flowers. Day 6: Make your way back towards Athens, stopping at Agistri for the night. If anyone needs to head out early, there’s a ferry from here back to Piraeus that runs nearly every hour. Day 7: Finish up in Piraeus and make your way back towards Athens to fly home. Though I didn’t have the chance to do the Cyclades or more than Lefkada in the Ionians, I already know I want to go back and explore some of the most-loved and lesser-known islands in the area. Greece easily became one of my favorite countries in Europe thanks to the open culture, the truly delicious food that was so cheap and fresh, and the baby blue and crystal clear water. One of my most memorable vacations in my entire life (up there with the Galapagos Islands and a road trip of Route 66) was a ten-day vacation to the Greek Isles. Though I went to Athens (to start and wrap up), Santorini, and Naxos, among other islands, your post gives me ideas for more islands to visit–and the serious urge to go back again as soon as I can! I share that urge. I can’t wait to experience the Galapagos too! All the pics are so compelling that I want to travel their as soon as possible.Would like to hear from you about Greece.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bali-alternatives/,"Bali is Overtouristed, Here are 10 Destinations to Visit Instead",Indonesia,"Today, it seems that Bali is the closest thing a traveler can get to “paradise,” or at least the travel industry has made it seem so. Yet many are frustrated when they arrive to traffic jams, beaches littered with trash, and waits for photos at popular Instagram spots.  The reality is, Bali gets a staggering number of visitors. According to the Bali Hotels Association, Bali saw more than 6 million international tourists in 2018. Among the largest numbers of visitors per country was the United States, with nearly 240,000 visitors that year, but pales in comparison to China, which had a whopping 1.4 million. The island saw a 6.6% increase in tourism numbers from 2017 to 2018.   The BHA also provides statistics from over the last two decades. Bali saw roughly 2 million international tourists in 2008; this number grew to 3.3 million in 2013, then to 6.1 million in 2018. So let’s crunch some numbers: Bali tourism tripled over ten years. Over the five-year period from 2008 to 2013, the number of international tourists increased by 65%, while over the five-year period from 2013 to 2018, that count increased by 85%. Basically, the numbers show no signs of Bali tourism slowing down. According to CNN, overtourism not only leads to annoying crowds, but strains local resources and wreaks havoc on the environment. The crazy numbers of tourists have left a serious footprint in Bali, largely contributing to a “garbage emergency” on the island’s beaches.  So what does this mean? It means that the tourism and travel industry as a whole needs to re-evaluate the way we do what we do. We need to prioritize the health of awe-inspiring places like Bali over our own vacation selfies. And that’s not to say that we should stop traveling — of course not! What it does mean, though, is that it’s time we consider taking the road less traveled so as to have gentler effects on both the destinations we visit and the people who actually live there.  For example, Indonesia is made up of more than 17,000 islands, nearly 6,000 of which are inhabited, yet a third of all Indonesia’s tourism in 2017 only went to Bali. There are so many other islands in Indonesia to explore, not to mention the countless destinations around the globe that offer sandy beaches and blue waters, too.  With that said, here are ten destinations which serve as fantastic alternatives to Bali. Visiting these places can help to create a healthier and more stable tourism industry on the island of Bali, as well as bring tourism-fueled prosperity to other places. Choosing an alternative destination can even provide you with a more unique and authentic travel experience than you would find at an overtouristed location.  If you’re set on visiting Indonesia, but are open to choosing a different island, try: Lombok is the Indonesian island right next to Bali, home to beautiful sandy beaches, waterfalls, rice fields, and even a volcano. It also gets less rain than Bali does in the rainy season.  Lombok’s southern beaches are some of the best in Indonesia for waves, and even though Kuta is Lombok’s most-visited town, you will be amazed at the privacy and serenity that come from the sheer lack of crowds. Kuta is a great place to start, thanks to its proximity to Lombok International Airport, followed by chasing waterfalls up north, trekking Rinjani volcano and visiting the Gilis – three small islands off the coast with their own distinct atmospheres. Another location only a short distance from Bali is the Thousand Islands, a cluster of 110 islands in the Bay of Jakarta. The islands all have white sandy beaches and clear waters perfect for snorkeling and scuba diving.  Elevon of the islands are available to tourists, which means that the population of both locals and tourists is spread out, making for a very tranquil getaway. It’s the perfect destination if you like to island hop.    Tanjung Lesung is located in the province of Banten on the western coast of Java, about a three-hour drive from Jakarta. It offers one of the best beaches near the Indonesian capital thanks to its swimmable waters, good surfing, and 9-mile stretch of white sand. It also boasts beautiful coral reefs, which make for great snorkeling and diving.  Tanjung Lesung still has much of that cultural authenticity many tourists desire, and it even serves as the perfect jumping-off point to explore the volcanic island of Krakatau. If you’re thinking of checking on Bali for surfing, consider Java, or Sumbawa below, next.  Lombok’s next door neighbor, Sumbawa, is perhaps one of the least-visited places in Indonesia. Not only is Sumbawa an amazing spot for surfing, the island is home to the still-active volcano Mount Tambora, as well as waterfalls, pristine beaches and beautiful blue waters.  Visitors to Sumbawa will find the culture to be authentic to Indonesia as a whole, yet unique to the island itself.   The best way to get there is to take a ferry from Lombok’s east coast.  Morotai is one of eastern Indonesia’s Maluku Islands. Interestingly, the island played a role in World War II, acting as an Allied base in the fight in the South Pacific. Today, Morotai is home to countless diving spots where scuba divers can see the marine diversity of the reefs and even swim with harmless sharks. Morotai is certainly more rugged and forested than many other Indonesian islands, but the resulting natural beauty is awe-inspiring. And in true island fashion, the beaches on Morotai are gorgeous.  If you’re a scuba diver, check out Raja Ampat while you’re in the area. It’ll blow your mind!  If you’re open to something different from Indonesia, check out these destinations in other countries:  These two islands in southern Thailand are mostly locals-only islands, with a very small number of tourists. Koh Yao Noi boasts beaches and waterfalls that can be explored on bicycle or motorbike, and experienced rock climbers will love the rugged terrain.  Neighboring Koh Yao Yai is equally as beautiful and untouched. It has warm, clear waters, a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere, and a few eco-resorts. Koh Yao Noi and Koh Yao Yai are hidden gems compared to more touristy destinations in Thailand like Phuket. Not only do Koh Chang‘s affordability, friendly locals, and abundance of attractions make it a fantastic island getaway in general, they make it the perfect alternative to Bali.  The island’s warm waters are just right for snorkeling and scuba diving, and with countless beautiful beaches, you’re sure to feel like you’ve arrived in paradise. There is no shortage of activities at hand, either, as Koh Chang is one of Thailand’s largest islands, second only to Phuket. Plus, many of Koh Chang’s foreign visitors are young, free-spirited solo travelers, which makes the island an awesome destination for your own solo trip. This chain of 15 islands in the South Pacific screams, “relaxation,” but still has an adventurous side. From rugged mountains and limestone caves to coral reefs and blue lagoons, the small and remote Cook Islands has more to do than meets the eye!  The country is known worldwide for fantastic snorkeling & scuba diving in its crystal clear waters. Mountainous Rarotonga is the largest island, home to capital city Avarua, while Aitutaki boasts sandy islets, and Atiu offers the chance to explore island caves. Whether you’re looking to kick back or venture out, the Cook Islands is sure to make a great alternative to Bali. Tioman Island sits off the east coast of mainland Malaysia in the South China Sea. The island is a nature reserve and marine park due to its incredible biodiversity, as Tioman is equal parts tropical rainforest, sandy beach, and coral reef.   The island is home to some amazing snorkeling and diving spots, and even a few shipwrecks! From catching a wave on your surfboard to trekking through the jungle and chasing waterfalls, Tioman offers countless adventures. Different kinds of resorts on the island also ensure that you’ll be able to create a trip that suits your travel style. From the colonial-style capital city of Apia to the caves, blowholes, and lava fields on the big island of Savai’i, the two main islands & seven smaller islands of Samoa each have their own unique personalities. Samoa is surely one of the most culturally authentic experiences on this list, as it is less of a tourist destination than many other locations in the South Pacific. The islands, of course, boast white sand beaches, blue lagoons, and diving and surfing along the coast, but with the added allure of rainforests, rivers, and waterfalls, and even flea markets. Samoa is sure to be a trip which is equal parts relaxing and engaging.  While these are just a few of the great alternatives out there to Bali, there are so many more within Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, and Indonesia itself. Often, it only takes a bit of off the beaten path exploration to find the perfect island paradise. I encourage you to see what else is out there even if your heart is set on Bali. You might be pleasantly surprised.  For those who have looked for alternatives, what belongs on this list? What are some of your favorite Bali alternatives? Over tourism is the big problem in the current time. Most of the world top tourist places are experiencing this problem. Well, your suggestions are great!Thank you for the info! Agreed. I have been looking for less popular places lately, both for their sake and for my own sanity! very helpful article thank you! am about to revisit Lombok and agree with your words. Just to make you smile, i thought Id share a conversation i had today with a chinese traveler here in Kuala Lumpur (Bangsar village) where Im stopping over in transit. She said “It’s so quiet here, Im finding it hard to cope! I come from a big city in China and Ive never stayed anywhere so quiet in my life!”Actually Bangsar is a really nice place if you’re ever stopping over en route from europe to asia. Such a beautiful island!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-indonesia/,Indonesia Bucket List: 50 Things to Do,Indonesia,"It’s hard to think of a country with more to do in terms of culture, amazing landscapes, incredible beaches, and delicious food than Indonesia. I love how each island has something different to offer in terms of all of those things. Some have incredible wildlife encounters, some are all about diving and surfing, and others have incredible old temples to explore. Whether you’re the outdoorsy type or just want to chill on the beach all day, there’s something on this list for you. These are 50 Indonesia bucket list items to make your trip planning that much more varied and exciting, broken down by island: Chances are good that your beginning point in Indonesia will be in the capital – Jakarta on Java. This list has some of the best of the island, including some famous temples and volcanoes:  While there are numerous tour companies that offer sunrise jeep tours to see Mount Bromo, it’s a unique and rewarding experience to hike your way up to what’s perhaps Indonesia’s most popular volcano independently. Not only do you get to save money, it also makes the experience more flexible and exciting. The hike itself is not as challenging as some of the other volcano hikes in Indonesia, but the view on top is just as rewarding. Here’s a full guide to hiking Mount Bromo without a tour.  The city is not as well known as other places in the country, but since you are likely to have to spend a night or two here before or after the hike to Mount Bromo, you may be surprised to find how pleasant it is to take a long stroll around the city that’s friendly and little known to tourists. Many locals from all over Indonesia flock to Surabaya for its delicious local food. G-Walk and Pasar Atum are some of the great places for local food and people watching.  The Borobudur Temple is stunning in both photos and in person. The UNESCO World Heritage site is an important monument to the Buddhist civilization, and is worth the USD 25 entrance fee. The temple’s vastness and beautiful architecture reminds one of the equally stunning Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The temple is open to the public from 6am – 5pm daily, but if you are into photography, book a sunrise tour with an authorized tour company, or stay at the Manohara Resort (they are the only hotel that’s allowed to sell early entrance tickets) for early entrance.  The Prambanan Temple is the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia. The UNESCO World Heritage site is said to have been built to replace Borobudur (and Buddhism) as Hinduism’s power was on the rise back in the 9th century. Many tour companies include both Borobudur and Prambanan in one day, but there’s really no need to worry about being templed out, as the two temples are so different from each other. The Prambanan Temple is made of individual temples dedicated to Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva.  Mount Ijen was easily the most brilliant part of my first 9-month stint in Southeast Asia back in 2013. It was also a challenge to do solo and independently of a tour, as online information was scarce and Kawah Ijen is a little more off the beaten path. Here’s a full guide to trekking Mount Ijen independently. Absolutely do not miss the blue flames and sunrise, they were what made Mount Ijen so brilliant to me. While a popular destination for local tourists, you won’t be seeing too many foreigners at the Baturaden Waterfalls, as the place is not readily accessible to tourists. But if you are renting a motorbike, it is only about 30 minutes away from Puwokerto. Pack a proper swimsuit, some snacks and drinks and you are good to go. Many local families like taking their kids to the waterfalls on the weekends, so plan accordingly based on if you’d like a quiet experience, or a chance to hang out with the locals. Both Mount Bromo and Mount Ijen have gained their well deserved popularity, and should definitely be on your Indonesia bucket list. For something that’s currently still off the beaten path (though I doubt it will stay that way for long), include Dieng Plateau in your itinerary. Dieng Plateau is a unique volcanic complex that offers its pilgrims gorgeous green hills, multi-colored lakes, and of course, volcanoes. This blog provides a pretty comprehensive guide to hiking Dieng Plateau independently. A post shared by Jerre Stead (@selcouth_vagary) on Jul 15, 2018 at 5:26pm PDT  It is not the only set of waterfalls in Java, but sure looks the most gorgeous! Once a local secret, the word is out now as travel vloggers and Instagrammers began flying their drones in the area to show just how majestic the waterfalls are. You can hire a local guide to take you there and see the waterfalls from a view point, or do it yourself to get up close and personal. The path to the bottom of the waterfalls is steep, slippery and not the safest, so be your own judge and don’t do anything you are not completely confident in.  The metropolitan city is unlike anywhere else in Indonesia. It’s fast paced, rapidly developing with skyscrapers and mega malls. It’s a great place for a few days stay in between your adventure in the jungles and on the islands. Aside from shopping and great restaurants, the capital of Indonesia is also notoriously known for its insane road traffic. Getting to a place that should take no more than 30 minutes could sometimes end up as a 3 hour journey (no kidding!). It’s definitely one way to blend into the local culture, just keep your fingers crossed for an entertaining driver to keep you sane. Bali is the most popular island in Indonesia thanks to the great surf, multitude of pool villas, the unique culture, and the laid back hippie vibe in Ubud mixed with the glitz and glamour of Nusa Dua. Though it’s the most touristy part of Indonesia, there are still some hidden gems, great food, and awesome islands just off the coast worth exploring.  Bali is filled with so many gorgeous villas and resorts that it can be overwhelming when trying to make a choice. The trick is to just decide on a budget and look for a place with decent ratings. So many places offer private pools, floating breakfasts, in-house massages, and so much more. I am not usually a luxury traveler but can surely appreciate a little splurge here and there in my travels, and Bali is definitely the best place in Indonesia to do just that. Personally, I stayed at Komaneka Resort and loved the quiet black sand beach on the property, just as much as I loved soaking in rosebud-infused water in the bath tub and enjoying a cute little floating breakfast in the pool.  Bali is the perfect location for any adventurous soul hoping to learn to surf. If you have been wanting to pick up a new hobby, why not give it a try while you are in Bali? Check out this comprehensive guide to learning how to surf in Bali for more details.  I have recently turned mostly vegan and it’s been a surprisingly simple and delicious journey. Indonesia was my first country that I visited as a vegan and I was wowed by the options. From the local produce such as tempeh and gado gado, to amazing plant based cafes as well as cafes and restaurants with lots of vegan options, I was spoiled! Whether you are a vegan or not, I think it’s fun and oh-so-yummy to try eating only plant-based food. Here’s a list of the best vegan eats in Bali that should really be on your foodie bucket list! Non-vegans, I got you covered, too. Now, with cafes lined up at every single corner of the street, you could possibly spend the entire trip in Bali eating just “western” food, but where’s the fun?! Balinese cuisine is unlike anywhere else in the country. I loved Satay, which is essentially meat on a stick that’s barbecued to perfection. Dip it in peanut sauce and it’s easily the best thing in the world. Other classic Balinese food includes Babi Guling (translated as “rolling pork”), Tempeh (fermented soy bean), and of course, the classic Nasi Goreng (fried rice). Once a little gem of Bali, Sekumpul Waterfall is now The waterfall of Bali, alongside with the Aling Aling Waterfall. Both waterfalls are stunning, and while it can be pushed through in a day’s trip (both waterfalls are about 2 hours drive from Ubud), a better idea is to spend a night in Bedugul. You are in Bali, after all! Some of the popular beach clubs in Bali are the Potato Head Beach Club and Ku De Ta in Seminyak, as well as Old Man’s Bar and Finn’s Beach Club in Canggu.  Mount Batur is accessible from anywhere in Bali. Aside from the 2am morning call, which could be excruciating to some, the hike is relatively easy compared to Mount Rinjani or Mount Lombok, and can be completed in just one morning. What’s Bali without some relaxing yoga sessions? Have a good stretch at one of the many yoga studios in Bali. The Yoga Barn in Ubud has multiple beautiful studios in their compound, complete with an in-house cafe, hostel, and private accommodation. Other than daily classes, they also organize retreats and courses if you are interested. If you are in Canggu, check out The Practice.  The Devil’s Tear on Nusa Lembongan is a wave smashing up against a rock for quite the display when the swell is big and it’s high tide. It is quite the display of Mother Nature especially when the tide is high during golden hour! I personally find the tide pools next to The Devil’s Tear more impressive, but you should go see both and make the call yourself. Here’s a complete guide to Nusa Lembongan.  If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, it would be difficult for me to believe that such baby blue exists in the tropics. The Blue Lagoon was the highlight of my trip to Nusa Ceningan. Nusa Ceningan is the smallest island nestled between Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida, and is perfect for a day trip, if I had to pick one.  I am sure you’ve seen photos of this T-Rex named peninsula (or whale, it’s really a bit of both!). It is the most popular photo spot on the island, and for good reason! The viewpoint truly does promise a stunning view, but don’t end the trip there – challenge yourself with a steep climb down to the gorgeous beach below. If you can, give yourself a few days on the island as it’s not the only awesome thing to do on Nusa Penida. Check out my guide to the secret spots of the island here.  My heart skipped a beat when I found this treehouse on Airbnb. Waking up in Rumah Pohon on Nusa Penida got me feeling like Wendy in Peter Pan, and it truly is one of the dreamiest places I’ve stayed in. Since the word got out (my bad!), people have flocked to the treehouse for a photo op – most of them do not actually spend the night there, and just walk up the stairs to take photos. However you can only get the sunrise shot if you actually stay there. Should you spend a night here? Read my full review on the Rumah Pohon and decide for yourself. Ask your guesthouse where the local ladies get their groceries and check out the local morning market in the region of Bali you’re staying in. If you’re lucky, they might just let you tag along. I loved devouring sweet, tangy mangoes while watching the ladies negotiate with each other. This part of Indonesia is my personal favorite and the part of the country that I keep returning to. To me, this is what Bali was before Eat, Pray, Love, back when it was still small and rural. For a taste of Indonesia without the crowds, check out this region. There are many boat trips from Lombok to Flores Island, and the experience can be absolutely amazing. From luxurious, air-conditioned cabins, to cuddling with your shipmates on the open air deck every night, there’s definitely something for everybody. The boat trips are fun and overall a unique experience, but make sure you pick a reputable one as the waves could be rough at times, and shipwrecks have been reported in the past. Personally, I took the public ferry and that was an experience in itself! Both can easily be booked in person for the best rates.  Up for a true challenge? Mount Rinjani delivers. It was one of the toughest hikes I’ve done in Southeast Asia, but definitely also one of the most memorable and rewarding. I wrote a full guide on how to hike Mount Rinjani on a budget here. (Note: Unfortunately, the recent earthquake has shaken the northern side of this beautiful island full of beautiful people. If you are traveling to Lombok soon, please check with the local authorities on the safety in Northern Lombok.) There are so many cute beach bungalows that are affordable on Lombok, in the Gilis, and in Sumbawa, so why not? Plus, you totally deserve a little R&R after the trek to Mount Rinjani. There are so many options on Airbnb (here’s $25 off if you book through this link!) and Booking.com (here’s $30 off if you book through this link!).  When I first visited Lombok 5 years ago, nobody was talking about this waterfall. Nowadays it’s usually included in most Rinjani trekking packages. I am not mad about it though – it gave me a reason to come back! There’s no better way to cool off your feet after what could have been an exhausting hike to Mount Rinjani. It’s stunning and powerful.  There are actually five waterfalls on Northern Lombok. If you have a full day, I recommend hiring a driver / renting a motorbike if you are comfortable and explore all five of them.  This is the hike that will give a much nicer view of the rice fields! You could start the trek early in the morning, or do an overnight trek. A guide is a good idea to find your way. You can ask anyone in Senaru to help you book it.  If Rinjani and Bukit Pergasingan sound a bit too challenging, there are still options! You only need to “hike” for 5 minutes to get to the wooden star platform. It’s pretty cool and a nice place to relax after an early morning hike, or as your one and only hike in the area.  Most of the beaches on the south side won’t have a sunset view, except for Semeti Beach! I had so much fun climbing all over them and exploring while waiting for the sun to set. The road is terrible, but if you’re confident on a motorbike, don’t miss this one. Tampah Beach was one of my favorites as it was the cleanest and least crowded beach in Kuta Lombok. In fact, there was no one else when I was there so if you are looking for some quality alone time, you know where to go. More beautiful beaches in Kuta, Lombok here:  In the Kuta area, there’s hill after hill and bay after bay with an almost limitless number of areas to paraglide, and the sport is really catching on. One of the best spots in order to get a view of the sunset is the Mandalika resort area, with tandem flights offered by Lombok Playground.  If you’re into snorkeling, want to surf a wave that almost nobody else is on, or just want to have a beach almost entirely to yourself, take a boat trip to Lombok’s neighboring island, Sumbawa.  The Gilis are the perfect place to kick back and relax, eat good food, and spend some time island hopping. There is nothing quite like the golden glow of a Gili sunset as the sun bathes the powdery sands and sweeps the shallow shores. Lots of people catch the sunset over one of the many swings on the beach, which is cute. Here’s a guide to Gili Air, my favorite of the three, to get you started.  The Gilis are the perfect place to learn how to freedive. Each island has freediving schools, the water is warm, and the instructors are good! Plus, once you learn how to do it, you can visit the underwater statues. Click here to read more about my experience with Freedive Flow on Gili Air. This is another one of my favorite parts of Indonesia, with some of the world’s best diving and most beautiful beaches in Komodo National Park.  It’s the only place in the world where you can see the Komodo Dragons, so obviously it has to be on your bucket list. Komodo Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that close to 2000 Komodo Dragons call home. They roam freely on the island, can smell blood, and move fast. Make sure you follow the rangers when visiting them! Bonus points if you make this part of your liveaboard diving experience.   I had the pleasure of diving with the manta rays during my 6-day liveaboard diving trip in Komodo National Park. Up until today, I still can vividly remember the huge and magnificent manta ray that swiftly swam past me. It is a beautiful experience you need to try out yourself!  With an abundance of manta rays, diverse species of sharks, turtles, untouched corals, drift dive opportunities and unimaginable underwater landscapes complete with a dive site with more species of fish than the entire Caribbean, the Komodo Islands are perfect for a multi-day boat trip. I loved going with Wicked Diving. Read more about my experience here. A trip to Sumba Island feels like a journey back in time. Expect to be blown away by thatched traditional clan houses in the hilltop villages, where the most indigenous traditions are kept for generations. The powerful waves are also perfect for professional surfing. While it is pretty much off the grid, you will be surprised to find quite a number of luxurious resorts,as well as a unique on-campus hotel school tended by local students on the island. Whether you are looking to immerse in unique, authentic local culture and stay in a hotel that allows interaction with locals, or a luxurious holiday with plenty of challenging surfing opportunities, Sumba Island will not disappoint. For an off the beaten path experience and some of the world’s best diving, head to West Papua. It’s remote, but oh so worth it.  It was one of the best trips I’ve ever done in my life. This is coming from a girl who has been traveling solo around the world in the last 6 years. The diving was incredible, and sailing through the Robinson Crusoe-like islands, most of which are uninhabited, had me giddy each and every day. Click here to read more about the liveaboard trip I took.   For those looking for an authentic Raja Ampat experience, a stay at Arborek Village whose inhabitants have been living worlds apart for an eternity, will enable you a rare glimpse into the authentic world of West Papua. Here’s a full guide on getting off the beaten path in Arborek, Raja Ampat. Yet another incredible corner of Indonesia, Sumatra is famous for being one of the only places in the world where you can see orangutans. It’s also popular for huge and uncrowded surf, and some of the more remote areas of the country.  If you want to see orangutans, head to Bukit Lawang in Sumatra. Most of the orangutans you will see are “semi-wild,” meaning they were most likely orphaned, have been rehabilitated, and have since been released back into the wild. Visiting the areas where they live also help keep their homes preserved as we prove to the local authorities that this could be a lucrative opportunity. Bukit Lawang is a tiny trekking town in the north of Sumatra.  Most people just breeze through, using it as a hub for the nights before and after their jungle trek. As a result, there are fewer tourists who stay in the area, and so the locals tend to be much more receptive and curious. The town itself is lovely but it was the people that made the place wonderful.  Huh? That was my answer when someone asked if I wanted to go see an island lake within a lake within an island. That’s Lake Toba for you, and that was interesting enough for me to want to see it. It’s peaceful and quiet, has nice, chilly weather that I definitely appreciated after sweating all over elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Sipiso Piso Waterfall is the tallest waterfall in the country. Naturally, the waterfall is nothing short of stunning and magnificent. Combine Lake Toba mentioned above with Sipiso Piso Waterfall for an amazing 2-day trip. Mount Sibayak is one of the two active volcanoes in Berastagi. It’s not a technically challenging hike, but it pays to hire a guide to lead the way. It’s best to start your hike in the wee hours as it may get unbearably hot in the day. Weh Island is perfect for divers looking to scuba dive in a secluded island that’s off the beaten path. It’s a gorgeous dive site but doesn’t see nearly as many tourists as other islands in Indonesia, as there’s not too much entertainment or other activities on the island. It’s Sumatra’s best-kept secret, so if you are a diving enthusiast, check it out!  It is currently one of Indonesia’s best kept secrets. Getting there involves flying to Kendari Airport, followed by a taxi ride to the harbor, and a boat to the island. The infrastructure is limited, and tourism is just about to get started, so getting around on the island might also take some planning and working with what you can get. The rewards? An absolutely authentic and unforgettable Indonesian island experience. Sounds like a pretty fair trade to me! The Maluku islands were once a popular travel destination, until religious war broke out in 1999. The islands received few visitors after that. This forgotten spot is a paradise for those who are looking for a truly off the beaten path travel experience in Indonesia. While you could catch a local flight to Neira Banda Neira, a much more memorable way to travel to the original spice islands is to take the massive cargo ship, Pelni Ship. On the islands, give yourself plenty of time and serendipity to be able to appreciate the beauty of Maluku islands that has been long forgotten by the world.  One can easily spend 2 weeks to 2 months in Indonesia and barely scratch the surface. Perhaps the best thing about traveling in Indonesia is that regardless of your length of stay, it is possible to explore Indonesia on a small budget. Back when I was backpacking in Southeast Asia in 2013, I spent $30 / day and was able to see and do everything I wanted to. Challenging yourself to travel in a country on a small budget not only will help you save some money, but also encourage creativity. Inspired to go on an Indonesia adventure yet? I hope this list helped you to discover some amazing activities and places that you didn’t know about, and opened up more possibilities! Indonesia is perfect for exploration over several months, or several trips. It’s a place I keep going back to, and can never get tired of. I didn’t know Indonesia looked this stunning. Would love to visit all the spots you listed! Nice post! I would like to visit there. With your blog, it seems how Indonesia is beautiful and full of such things. Thank you for sharing! Proud to be Indonesian 🙂 But, I think you missed another amazing place and it is Lake Toba in North Sumatra. You must put this into your bucket list 🙂 Lake Toba is the largest lake in Indonesia even in Southeast Asia. You must go there and you will not regret 🙂 I’ve actually been there! You’re right it should be on this list.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/kuta-lombok-guide/,"The Ultimate Kuta, Lombok Guide",Indonesia,"A gecko scurries past my head as I write this from the porch of my bamboo bungalow on Kuta, Lombok. Unlike its neighbor with the same name in Bali, Kuta Lombok is laid back, chilled out, and uncrowded, at least for now. I first came here four years ago and it’s blown my mind a bit coming back to see how much it has changed. There are more bungalows now, more coffee shops with Mediterranean style food and bamboo straws (yay!), and though it’s rapidly growing, I found this has only added to its charm.  The people are still friendly, and it’s still a surfer’s paradise. It’s also the perfect jumping off point for a bunch of activities and beautiful beaches in the south of Lombok. Here were a few of my favorites while in Kuta: This viewpoint is popular with visitors to Kuta for two big reasons: It’s only about a 15 minute scooter right away on mostly good roads, and the views are stunning in every direction. It’s most popular for the sunset since most of the beaches near Kuta are south-facing so it’s one of the only ones where you can see such a stunning sunset view close to Kuta. That said, I would recommend heading there at any time of the day because there are so many strands of sand built into one little area and most of them get a lot less love than the hill itself which only tends to attract crowds at sunset. It’s the perfect place to spend an entire day, if you ask me. Find it here. This umbrella-shaped rock is just a short drive over from the Sunset point, or a long walk, if you prefer. You can also take a little boat ride from the beach which takes 10 minutes or so, or you can park your scooter closer to the rock and walk over the rocks and along the tide pools. I decided to walk and it looked like I was the only person all day who had decided to do that. As the boats shuttled tourists from other parts of Indonesia over to the rock, a few asked me if I had walked, and if I was alone, in a mix of surprise and concern! However I thought it was dreamy, watching the fishermen in the bay nearby and getting some exercise. Upon reaching the rock you may find a few guys selling coconuts. One of their selling points is they will take photos for you, like this one. Not bad to have a photographer and a coconut in exchange for 15,000 RP, I’d say! You can find it here. Mawun beach is popular for its beauty and was my first stop while exploring the beaches around Kuta. To be honest, it wasn’t my favorite mostly because it didn’t have the character of some of the beaches to follow. Still, it’s only a 10,000 RP fee to park your scooter and have a look. Plus, there are chaise lounges with umbrellas, which most of the other beaches on this list don’t have. Find it here. This was my favorite beach in the area for relaxing without any other people around. Their selling point is it is the cleanest beach on Lombok, and there are no touts on the beach (You will find there are often children selling bracelets elsewhere. I don’t really have an opinion to push on this because it’s a tough situation and I don’t have the answers, but I did enjoy the undisturbed silence on this beach). There was no trash and the locals obviously work hard to clean it daily. It’s not great for swimming since there are a lot of rocks in the water, but I thought that added to its rugged charm. Plus, there’s this little beach hut for one partway down the beach! There’s also a friendly family selling octopus and coconuts on the beach, and it’s nice to support them for their efforts to keep the beach so nice. Definitely stop by this one for some peace and quiet. Navigate here (for Lancing as well) Like Tampah, and conveniently located right next-door, Lancing is another pristine and quiet beach. There aren’t any facilities but that was just fine with me! When I showed up, there was no one else around except for a local kid. We played around with my drone for a while and then went for a swim. Though there was a language barrier it was such a heartwarming and cute thing to play with him for a little while that afternoon. That’s the lovely thing about an island as quiet as Lombok, these opportunities are still around and as a guest here you are still warmly welcomed. I absolutely love these two beaches for the sunsets and the incredible volcanic stone. I climbed all over it hand over foot like a monkey, finding something stunning and new around every corner and bend. This beach is not easy to get to like the others mentioned in this post. The road is truly horrible and I would only recommend it if you’re very confident on a motorbike or have asked a local to drive you. That said, it was one of the coolest features in the area and I highly recommend it! Give it at least a few hours to explore the caves and coves. You can find it here. This beach is popular with surfers and you will find there are a lot more places to eat and hang out here than the other beaches. There are lounges with umbrellas that you can rent as well. I ended up there on an Indonesian holiday and found it to be particularly busy, but I’ve heard that it is a lot more laid-back on other days. Given this, I didn’t get to really enjoy the beauty but I was told that’s a shame because it is apparently a nice beach after all. It’s also pretty easy to reach, unlike Semeti. Navigate to it here. Those are just a few of probably hundreds of beaches along the southern coastline of Lombok. With so many hills and peninsulas, little coves and side roads, you could spend weeks just discovering the beaches in and around Kuta. I had about 4 days though I wish I’d had more! The first time I came to Lombok years ago, I passed through its neighboring island, Sumbawa, by bus. I remember thinking it was more beautiful than Bali. This time around I wanted to return for a chance to hang on an island that doesn’t get many tourists at all. If you’re into snorkeling, want to surf a wave that almost nobody else is on, or just want to have a beach almost entirely to yourself, Ozone Adventure does an amazing day trip from Kuta. Bonus: You get to see the entire southern coastline of Lombok with Rinjani behind it on the way, and a stunning sunset upon your return. Surfing and yoga tend to follow each other – maybe it’s the balance required for both? Kuta is no exception, with two yoga studios to choose from (or alternate between) that offer surfer’s yoga, vinyasa or gentle flow. I tried Mana and enjoyed the class. A drop in class costs 100k RP or you can buy a package for a discount. Mana also has accommodation on offer which looked amazing. The easiest, and often cheapest, way to get to Kuta is to fly into Lombok‘s Praya airport and take a taxi down. The cost should be around 100,000 RP for the 20-minute journey. The Blue Bird Taxis run the meter and are trustworthy. It’s also possible to take the ferry over from Bali or Sumbawa, depending on the direction you’re traveling from. If coming from Bali, head to Padang Bai harbor and take a fast boat over. Prices vary with the average hovering over $50. There’s also a public ferry which is much cheaper (around $3.50) however it’s much slower at about 5-6 hours depending on delays. If on the Gili islands, there is a public boat that costs 15,000 RP and departs when full, usually every 15 minutes or so. However both of these options will drop you off at the northwest side of Lombok at Lembar Harbor. From there negotiate a taxi down to Kuta for around 250-300k RP, or take a shuttle bus run by Perama, buying the tickets directly from them for the best price. Once in Kuta, most people rent a motorbike to get around. Plenty of them have attachments for your surfboard or if you’re not a surfer, you can just get a standard one. I paid 50,000 RP per day for mine and stopped on the side of the road from time to time for a bottle of petrol which runs at 10k to fill up the tank about halfway. It’s a cheap and easy way to get around. The roads alternate between good with a bit gravelly and sandy in places. However this is mostly due to construction and the roads are becoming more accessible and paved with every passing day. A few words about renting a motorbike: I’d suggest always wearing a helmet, minimize driving at night, and go slowly. If you’re not comfortable, hire a driver and try to split the cost with other people from your guest house.  I love that instead of a typical resort setup, the rooms are built with inspiration drawn from a Sasak village. The absolute delight of Village Vibes is definitely the single rooms, which allows solo travelers to enjoy a stay at a resort without having to pay the extra money. Of course, feel free to indulge in the double room and have a nice, big bed all to yourself!  From the extra touch on toiletries that include after-sun lotion in the bathroom, to the delicious complementary breakfasts (definitely not your average toast, jam, and scrambled eggs combo!), topped off with a lovely pool on the rooftop, Rawa Lombok Resort is totally worth the splurge. I was so impressed by the daily breakfast that I actually went to bed looking forward to it every night. It’s a mere 3 minute walk to the beach, and a short scooter ride to the center of town. You can book both resorts through this link for $30 off. There are gorgeous Airbnb options as well! I hope this guide helps you to have a magical Kuta adventure. It was amazing to return and see how much it has grown and thrived since the first time I visited almost 5 years ago. I’m already thinking of returning simply because there were so many things to do that it seems it would take months to do it all. But that’s traveling for you, there’s always more to discover and the trips are never long enough! Once again, in addition to the nice photos (that one under “Pantai Semeti and Telawas” is an award winner in a gallery), thorough updates on the wonders of just one little part of Indonesia, and honest assessments, I appreciate how in your travels you do what you can to push for supporting the locals and show empathy to the kids. You mention how it is a great experience for you to play with the kids and hang with the locals, but I can’t imagine the impact you are having on them, a story they might tell for years (even if they are getting used to more tourists, they can tell if you are authentic). BTW, have you ever bonded enough to keep in touch with any of these kids or locals (even via snail mail)? I just learned from a friend that “Sama Sama” means “You’re welcome” which is a nice name for a bungalow (if Same Same means the same thing, no pun intended!), too bad it wasn’t the best deal! I hope like you do that the area doesn’t develop too much further from the crowds you saw in the video, but you always seem to find lots of isolated jewels which by being a little more difficult to get to hopefully stay that way! BTW, with all the sunsets and isolated showers, have you caught any cool rainbows??? I have kept in touch with locals I met in South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines! It’s so cool to see what they’re up to. I didn’t see any rainbows! I kept looking, though! Geez that place looks gorgeous!!! I’ve just recently started to realize that Indonesia might be way cooler than anyone gives it credit for There’s so much to explore. I absolutely love Indonesia more and more with each place I see there. So vast and diverse! soooo cool nice Hi Kristin, Thanks so SO much for putting this post together. It’s the most useful about Kuta so far and I love how genuine you are.  I wanted to pick your brains about our upcoming trip, actually more about the trip from Bangsal Harbour to Kuta. My husband and I will be hiring a driver and would like to make stops along the way, e.g. Tiu Kelep waterfall. Would you suggest any must-sees on the drive down? We’re happy to take detours for anything special 🙂 Thanks in advance! Amy Hi Amy, It’s a gorgeous drive in general! I have some favorites of mine in Lombok here but most of them are not exactly on that drive. You could take some detours, though: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/lombok-indonesia-things-to-do/ Love your blog! I’m taking my 17 yr old son to Bali/Lombok for 3 weeks in August.  Going to head straight to Nusa Lembongan and Penida from the airport for 5 days, then to Lombok for 5 days.  Then on to Gili air for a couple, Ubud for 4 days, and then finishing up in Canggu area for a few days before heading home. (Btw, your blog has been so hopeful with planning our trip!!) Anyway,  Just wondering what you think about Sengiggi? The ferry from Nusa goes there, so I initially thought we’d base ourselves there and explore the island by day on a motorcycle, but I’ve read that it’s super touristy with a heavy party vibe and not in a good way. After reading your post, I think I’m going to stay in Kuta instead (but I’ve also heard there’s kind of a weird heavy vibe from some of the locals there, too).  But just wondered if you could provide clarity on that 🙂 I’ve spent a lot of time in Kuta and I prefer it over Senggigi. I actually think the party vibe will be more on Gili Air and potentially Canggu than it would be in Senggigi. The other thing is, Kuta is quite far south. Most of the waterfalls are up north so if you want to see those, pick Senggigi as a jumping off point. it’s much more convenient for the smaller islands you want to see too. Have fun! It sounds like a great trip. Hey thanks for this post!I’ve been researching travel ideas for some time, I’ve never travelled alone before so I guess the idea is still kind of scary haha but I’m hoping to get some tips. Lombok’s been on my list for a while now. Honestly I’m pretty clueless about traveling alone.My biggest concern probably is safety as a solo female traveler or just simply how to get around to doing thing. It seems there’s loads to explore but Im not too sure how to get about doing that. I have about 9 days. I was wondering did you mostly explore the places on your own and just got around on a scooter or do you advise getting guides/ join groups along the way for activities etc? Also, do you know of any good hikes that I can probably do on my own or would that be a bit risky? Let me know what you think!  Thanks a lot! Hi Glor, I have more info on how I navigated the island here, with a driver for the northern part: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/lombok-indonesia-things-to-do/I did mostly drive myself around Kuta but you can make friends there and find people to drive with if that makes you uncomfortable. I also have lots of resources here for solo female travelers in general. Hope it all helps! Have so much fun! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel/ and this one is specifically for Indonesia: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tips-for-traveling-solo-in-indonesia/ Your blog has been super helpful. I am travelling alone to Bali and Lombok for 14 days and I was thinking of 3 days in Seminyak when I arrive, 5 days in Ubud, 2/3 days Kuta, Lombok and 2 days on Gili Air. I don’t want to be completely isolated from other people though and I am not sure how difficult it is to get from Kuta to Gili Air. Would you recommend these spots? And is that enough time in each location? I’d avoid Seminyak actually, and spend that time elsewhere, perhaps Canggu? There are buses and small vans that go from Kuta to the Gilis. They can organize it for you! I don’t think you’ll be isolated at all 🙂 Thanks for the post! Amazing content 🙂 I am going to Bali next week for 13 days to unwind. I am staying in Ubud for 4 days than heading on over to Kuta Lombok for few days then over to Gili Air for a few days.  (I changed my plans to go to Kuta Lombok after reading your blog!)  I do like waterfalls though. Are there any day trips in Kuta to see the waterfalls there or should I try to turn a day trip from Kuta to Senggig to see them? Other than the waterfalls is there anything that Senggigi offers in terms of beauty and nature that Kuta does not? Cheers,Adam So cool you’re going to Kuta! I’d consider climbing the Rinjani volcano if you’re into hiking: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mt-rinjani-trek-reviews/ If you just want to see waterfalls, you can do that as a day trip, but it’s going to be a long day. You can take an organized tour from Kuta or you can hire a private driver and split it with some friends/other travelers to make it more convenient and cheaper. More here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/lombok-indonesia-things-to-do/ Hi. Are there any recommended massage /beauty places in Kuta Lombok? YES Matcha spa. They are amazing. I usually book back to back massages there because they’re that good. Thank you so much for sharing the tips in getting around Kuta Lombok. Planning to go in Nov but unsure about the weather that time. Will be heading to Gili Meno, would you recommend to take the ferry from Senggigi or Bangsal? Bangsal is the place to catch the ferry to the Gilis.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/indonesia-travel-costs/,Tips From the Banker: The Real Cost of Travel in Indonesia,Indonesia,"2018 update: I originally wrote this post in 2013, traveling in Indonesia on a shoestring. I returned this year with a bigger budget, spending more on accommodation and transport, though some categories, like food, have remained the same. You’ll see both options in this post. Indonesia, like Malaysia, had a lot of varying reviews from fellow travelers when I asked about the cost.  One thing was easy for everyone to agree on: it’s a big country that isn’t easy to get around. Here’s the thing about Indonesia: it can be really cheap, or it can be quite expensive, depending on one big thing – transportation.  There is a huge discrepancy between private, tourist transport and local transport.  I’m not sure why, but I never did see another foreigner on any of the public buses or ferries that I took anywhere in Indonesia.  I couldn’t quite understand it since a private car costs around $100 one-way, and a public bus tended to cost more like $1.50 for the same distance.  It was a no-brainer for me when I was traveling on a shoestring budget! Apart from transport costs, there are some other ways to take the cost way down in Indonesia, such as where you eat, your haggling ability, and whether you do things independently or by tour.  Where you are in Indonesia is also a huge contributing factor. I backpacked in Indonesia for 6 weeks, and my daily average came out to $31/day (leaving out my SCUBA trip as I realize that is a factor many people won’t involve when planning their trip). When I returned in 2018 and spent about 2 months there, my daily average came out to about $50/day. Here’s the breakdown: In places popular with backpackers, such as Bali, Yogyakarta, you will plenty of hostels with solid facilities. This was not the case when I visited in 2013, but Indonesia’s popularity among budget backpackers have increased tremendously since then.  The cheapest place I stayed was in Bukit Lawang, a trekking town in Sumatra, for only 50,000 Rupiah (USD$5) per night for my own room with a balcony on the river, ensuite bathroom, and a mosquito net around the bed without holes – trust me, this was a luxury.  The most I paid was closer to $15 in Java at a guesthouse that had a bit of a monopoly on the area in Kawah Ijen. Hostels in Bali: $5-$12 (book your hostel in Bali here) Hostels in Yogyakarta: $4-$10 (book your hostel in Yogyakarta here) Hostels in Surabaya: $7-$12 (book your hostel in Surabaya here) In general, accommodation in Sumatra was the cheapest, while rooms on Flores and especially Java happened to be a lot more expensive and offered much less bang for my buck. If you prefer a private room to yourself, there are many great options on Airbnb especially if you are traveling to Bali and the Nusa islands. I stayed at a tree house (as pictured above) overlooking one of the most magnificent views in my life, and a huge villa that could’ve easily accommodated 4 people for $55 on Nusa Penida. Booking.com also has some great hotel options. I only had one major (quite major) blunder when getting around Indonesia.  I was so used to the cheap Air Asia flights in Malaysia, where I would spend $18 to cross the country, that I didn’t consider how much it would cost me to get from one end of Indonesia in Sumatra, to the other in Flores, in order to make it in time for a SCUBA diving liveaboard trip I had booked.  What was the damage? Almost $300 US dollars. Yeah, ouch. To avoid that, plan your stops in Indonesia and book your flights in advance. Otherwise, I made sure to always take public transportation.  As I mentioned earlier, nobody else seemed to do this, but it was incredibly cheap.  The least expensive bus I took was about 4 hours and cost me $1.40.  I’m not sure why almost nobody else did this, as it wasn’t too difficult and even ended up in some funny stories and great interactions with locals.  I must be in about 100 people’s random photos at this point. *Tip: Don’t let a tout sell you a ticket.  Pay the attendant on the bus directly.  Even if you’re dropped off outside of what appear to be ticket windows, they take a cut.  Climb onto the bus that is going where you want to go, and you’ll be approached once the bus gets going by an attendant who will quote a price.  Don’t be afraid to say, “mahal” (expensive) if it sounds astronomical. In general, public, non-air-conditioned buses should not be more than a few dollars.  Also, be aware that many people smoke in Indonesia, and even enclosed busses will sometimes have smokers on board.  This is just the reality of overland travel in this country. When you are on the islands, you have two options: hire a driver, or rent a scooter. In Lombok, I hired a driver with a nice SUV for about $50 for the day, which was about 5 times the price of renting a scooter, but I was able to get to a bunch of cool spots in Lombok that I wouldn’t be confident to ride a scooter to. Renting a scooter is cheap and easy, though you’d want to be fairly confident riding one, as you’d bound to come across some dirt roads. Be a smart girl and get insured!  This is where Indonesia became fabulously cheap.  I often ate meals, especially in Java, for less than a dollar.  The way to do this is to find a warung which cater more to locals and serve local foods.  Indonesian food is delicious, so why not eat local? It helps to know what a few of the items on the menu are before ordering, as they may not be listed in English and it’s possible the cook will not speak English. Mie – Noodles Nasi – Rice Goreng – Fried Nasi Campur – Steamed rice, noodles, some sort of vegetable, and fried chicken, typically Soto Ayam – Chicken noodle soup (soto means soup) Ayam – Chicken Sate – Grilled meat on a stick Tempeh – A soy-nut meat substitute (try it, it’s good!) Sumatra was by far the cheapest island in Indonesia that I visited.  I only wish I could have stayed there longer.  The food was amazing, the people were kind, and the public transport was perfectly reasonable.  I only had a chance to visit Lake Toba and Bukit Lawang, but I plan to return soon and see more of it. The places that returned the least value for my money were Java and Gili Trawangan. That said, they were still cheap at anywhere from $8-$15 per night per room.  Also, I had an absolute blast on Gili T and really enjoyed the beautiful volcanos in Java.  It was worth it to pay a little more.  Haggle, haggle, haggle!  Indonesia travel costs can vary widely if the ticket seller thinks he can get more money out of you.  The starting price is never the ending price, and this goes for almost everything. Even posted prices are sometimes negotiable.  At least try, and if you don’t get the price you want, walking away is a good tactic.  You’ll almost always hear, “OK! Come back,” and will get the discounted price you wanted.  In more touristed areas like Bali and Gili T, this will be tougher as many short-vacationers don’t know this and will pay the astronomical prices. Buy tickets directly from the sellers. Cutting out the middle man always saves money.  Book tours directly which helps avoid scams and is always cheaper. Lastly, SIM cards were ridiculously cheap.  I really don’t know why, but I only paid $3 for 2 gigs of 3G with the 3 network. I have never spent so little on a data plan in my life! Simpati tended to work much better in the smaller towns and cost me a lot more. I alternated between the two cards as needed. Perfect! This is what I need to prepare for my trip! Yay I love being helpful 🙂 I looked into Kalimantan and Tanjung Puting NP seemed like a good option, however the fact that Kalimantan is not as touristy as the Malaysian Borneo it lacks good infrastructure. And all tours offered there have gotten too expensive, so that’s why i’m looking at the Malaysian Borneo. Sabah is also an option for us so If you would compare Sabah to Sumatra which one would you pick? In terms of trekking, wildlife and in general things to do there? Thanks:) Sumatra unless you’re a SCUBA diver in which case Sipadan in Sabah 🙂 My daughter, 17 in high school, is planning to apply for a trip to Indonesia as a foreign exchange  student  next summer for a month. This will be her second trip. This summer  she went as a foreign  exchange  student  to Germany. In Indonesia she will be living with a host family. I was hoping you could help me with a few questions. Your information  was extremely  helpful!!1. What are some essentials  she should bring to Indonesia? I saw you mentioned  a mosquito  net without holes.2. What is the weather like?3. Should we send her with cash or a debit card?4. What are some customs she needs to be aware of as a young lady?5. Is it appropriate  for her to cover her hair?6. Is it better to wear sandles  or tennis shoes?7. Are there any safety issues?8. Did most people  speak  English?9. Did you need any immunizations before going to Indonesia?10. Did you have to purchase bottled water?11. How was  the passenger’s hygiene  on the bus.12. Are there any foods she should  avoid?13. Was  there  any crime? I want her to be mentally prepared when she goes over there. Thank you!! Hi Jenelle, here’s my best attempt to get those answered:1. Lightweight clothing that covers her knees and shoulders (unless she’s studying on Bali which is Hindu), Mosquito net, more here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/packing-for-southeast-asia/2. hot and humid all the time. It’s tropical3. A bit of cash and a debit card with no foreign transaction fees like Charles Schwab4. http://www.ediplomat.com/np/cultural_etiquette/ce_id.htm5. She doesn’t need to6. sandles7. Dependent on where she’s studying but the host family should be able to fill her in on what not to do where they live8. No9. Yes, visit the travel doctor in your county or your GP: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/travel-healthcare-immunizations/10. yes11. The bus isn’t as pretty as back home but I never had any problems12. eat all the food! it’s delicious!13. What targets tourists is mostly just scamming and there is petty crime, like anywhere Rad tips Kristin! Will definitely be heading to Indonesia while in Southeast Asia. I’ve taken public transport in so many places so it’ll probably be my way of getting around there as well. Even if it was more expensive I’d still do it because it’s such a cool part of the experience! Awesome tip on getting the local SIM cards. For digital nomads, connectivity is vital. Thanks! Absolutely! I have to say, we have been unpleasantly surprised by how not cheap Indonesia has been. We expected prices on Bali to be somewhat inflated (and they were and the people there do not like to haggle, especially in high season), but I wish I had known that Flores would also be such a cash suck. I’ve been really shocked at how expensive lodging here has been (we only found one place in Labuan Bajo that had rooms for < $20US) given how gross and dirty and basic most of the rooms are. Transportation costs are pretty cheap, but everything else burns cash like nobody's business. We went to a padang place the other night in Bajawa, Flores (read: not a tourist town) and they charged us 90k for two plates of food & 2 mugs of tea, something we know should have been at most, half the price. I'm impressed you kept your meals cost so low because we find that we can rarely get away spending less than $3US per person, and that's going to restaurants that are meant for locals, not tourists. I think the blatant price gouging here in Indo is some of the worst I have experienced anywhere in Asia! Labuan Bajo was definitely expensive. I found a few decent places to stay (Gardena) for sub $20, but the guesthouse attendants were sometimes a little rude (the guy who works there. ugh!)  You’ve got to stay out of restaurants. Only eat at warungs. They’ll have one to two tables and no written menu.  Just point to what you want and if you can learn a few local words in Indonesia, it’ll save you tons of money. really like your blog. yeah i don’t know  why in bromo and ijen still many scammers agent. many peopleevent tourist lost their money a lot. Thanks Tony! It’s just one of those things I guess. The best thing to do is just be prepared. This post is awesome. Spot on! I think many travelers don’t do public transport because of a few reasons like it’s a hassle because there’s not fixed price or schedule, the bus/car is dodgy, or they can choose to spend just a little more on shared taxis. It’s just about preference. But surely for the more ‘local’ experience, the public transport (as in buses) are the way to go. The funny thing is the tourist busses sometimes stop more and take even longer. They’re equally dodgy! I am pretty surprised that sumatera is cheaper than java. I don’t know, for me, the accommodation, the transportation, the food are easy to find and vary in cost so it just suits you. Probably, it’s because I’m from java :p Well, sumatera is quite challenging. Can’t wait to explore it. And, thanks for visiting Indonesia. PS: Is that picture of Indomie that you put on the article? My eyes just spotted it anyway. It’s one of the best food in the world. LOL I found Sumatra to be the cheapest place I went to in Indonesia by far! The food was a little cheaper in Java but the real expense is in accommodation.  That’s mie in the photo 🙂 I think sate might be the best food in the world, though. If you want to visit again can I help. Cool , i barely see any foreigner who want’s to ride local transportation in Indonesia! To be honest you’re the first one! great information you have here in your blog! kee travelling! Nice post. I learn something new and challenging on sites I stumbleupon everyday. It’s always exciting to read through content from other writers and use a little something from other websites. Thanks for your marvelous posting! I actually enjoyed reading it, you’re a great author.I will ensure that I bookmark your blog and will eventually come back at somepoint. I want to encourage  continue your great posts, have a nice weekend! Hey Kristin – thanks for sharing this! We, too, found that the costs in Indo really varied, but overall, we were most disappointed by Flores. The accommodation was so crappy for what we he had to pay. Surprisingly, touristy Bali offered some real bang for the buck! I didn’t find Flores as bad as Java, but agree it was pricey. I can imagine Bali would be better but I skipped it. wow!! very details! luv it 🙂 🙂 TWB Hi there to every one, since I am acually eager of reading this website’s post to be updated regularly.It carries nice information. Awesome post. You should definitely visit my city and share your experience. Hey Kristin, I want to thank you for the great article; I am trying to organize a trip to Indonesia for this upcoming summer, and this is very helpful.   I was wondering if you had a quick second for me to ask you a question though about your travels.  When you are traveling in Indonesia, especially when you were in Java, were you traveling solo?  Did you meet people when you got there to travel with?  One of the only issues I am having right now in planning my trip is finding a travel buddy, and I am a little apprehensive to do Java alone as a female traveler.  If you did go solo how did you organize it?  Can you recommend relatively safe places to go in Java? thank-you so much I seriously appreciate the help. Kind regards, Heather Hi Heather,I travel solo 99% of the time and always meet people. Same with Java though it wasn’t as social as, say, Vietnam. Hi! I know you said getting to sumatra was one of the unfortunately expensive parts of indo for you, but how did you end up getting there? Flight?  Im trying to get there on my next indo trip and all I can find are random flights so im assauming thats the main way? Thx!!! It was getting from Sumatra to Flores that was expensive. I bought a flight from Kota Kinabalu in Malaysian Borneo to Medan in Sumatra for only $60 with Air Asia. Hi Kristin,A group of us are currently looking into traveling to Indonesia for a month and we weren’t really sure where the best places to go would be..My friend is in Bali so we would more than likely spend a week there in order for him to teach me a dive course, but other than that we have no idea about where we want to go, do you have any advice?I’m also not sure how much money we would need for our trip, we are currently completing our second Working Holiday Visa in New Zealand and shall be saving up while we are still over here and then traveling to Indo on our way home in June. Unfortunately that won’t leave us with much cash and we shall most probably to traveling on a budget.. I would like to see a couple of islands if possible and my main expensive will be diving, although i’ve heard its around $30 USD per dive, including discount (i’ll have my own dive gear and plan on paying for bulk dives) so it seems manageable providing i save enough.My last question is.. Whats the best way to get to and from the islands? I’m assuming there isn’t as many boats available in Indo compared to Thailand as the islands are further away? I love reading your posts and find all of your information extremely helpful in planning any trips abroad, so thank you!Keep up the awesome work,Emily 🙂 Hi Emily. If you take a look at the post, “She gave me rice and bananas” I talk about traveling cheaply and using local transport, which most people don’t do in Indonesia. If you do that you can get to Flores which has great (but more expensive) diving. Lombok and the Gili islands are great too. That’s the best use of a month there, I think. Hey !I really like your blog and it’s really helpful for all the travelers around the world especially the people who will come to see my country Indonesia.I have some questions:1) When did you start your trip in Indonesia ?2) Where is the most beautiful island that you really love ?3) What do you think about Indonesia ?4) Do you have any advice to make this country better and more famous ?  Thank you for your reply 🙂 Cheers !! 1) It was June 20132) Lombok or Rinca – both are great3) Indonesia is HUGE, very diverse, and a great place to explore but you need a lot of time to see it all4) There is so much more to Indonesia than Bali. I hope more people will realize that Hello.. I’m from Indonesiaif you come to Indonesia again, may you try to visit Raja Ampat Islands , Papua Barat ProvinceI think Raja Ampat Islands is the best place in Indonesia.. 🙂 That’s my plan for when I return! Hi Kristin, i just discovered your website. Wow well done! I have a question for you:) my wife and i are going to Indonesia for 3-4 weeks in August. We will do 1 week in Java to see temples, 1 week in Bali just because everyone seems to say GO TO BALI, and then 1 week in either Borneo (probably Sarawak) or Sumatra (Bukit Lawang). Do you have any recomendations on what would be our best wildlife/jungle experience? We want to see the orangutangs but i wouldn’t say it’s the most important thing.  Thanks!! Looking forward to hearing back from you and following your blog I haven’t been to Sarawak – which is actually Malaysia. Are you thinking of Kalimantan? I can only speak for Bukit Lawang which I absolutely loved. You can see from my photos here that I had a really good wildlife sighting experience! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bukit-lawang-trekking/ I heard you need a round trip ticket to obtain a visa to enter Indonesia. How did you work that into your trip? I got a 60-day visa in Kuala Lumpur before entering Indonesia since I was going to be there for longer than the 30 days you get with a VOA. I had heard they might ask for proof of onward passage when I applied but they didn’t. You can book a ticket on Expedia and cancel with no penalty as long as you cancel within 24 hours. So helpful. Thanks. Hey Kristin!I’m currently in Gili T and was wondering what the best (and cheapest!) way to get to Komodo was, I see some photos of you in your blog with Komodo dragons and have only found 4 days trip boats for 1.5 million..Any help would be greatly appreciated! 😀Thanks,Em The locals must take some kind of public transport, so ask around! I took a 6-day diving trip with Wicked Diving, which is more than 1.5 million, but so worth it do u have kids, i am asking this to know how does one manage travelling with kids No I don’t but check out ytravelblog.com or travelingcanucks.com as they both do! Have you tried to surf in Bali, Kristin?:) Bali is my next trip, thank you for detailed information, I can calculate now how much I’m gonna spend for accomodation and food there! I’m loving reading all of your info on Malaysia and Indonesia as my husband and I are currently planning our next backpacking adventure for this winter.  I’m curious, did you enter Indonesia by plane or by boat?  We’re contemplating flying into BKK and traveling overland south into Malaysia and then to Indonesia.  Did you happen to notice any good areas for surfing in either country? I took a plane and I think that might make the most sense from Malaysia anyways. Air Asia is pretty cheap from KL to Bali, like dirt cheap sometimes! Definitely tons of great surf in Indo. Try Kuta on the island of Lombok That really sucks about not being able to book flights online as it is more convenient.  But, $300 to fly from one island to another?  Ouch!  I am planning to go to Bali in 2017 and was considering spending a few days on Komodo Island while I was there, but not so sure about this now. That was from Sumatra, so from Bali might not be as bad since it’s much more major. But yeah, that was a tough one. What a wonderful fount of information you are! I have just recently started considering a visit to Jakarta to visit a new friend and as you have indicated, it looks like getting there will be by far the greatest expense.  I saw your helpful tips about travel within the country but what about travel from the U.S.  In my case travel would start in Houston, TX. Thanks Kutie “A beautiful moment in Indonesia” this caption and the photo above that was amazing. It was a great review. Wish you the best and more fun ahead of your life. Thanks!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/gili-air-island/,"Gili Air: What to Do, Where to Eat, Where to Sleep",Indonesia,"Gili Air directly translates to the ‘water island’, a fitting name, indeed. One of three of the Gilis off of the coast of Lombok in Indonesia, this is my favorite of the islands because it has the most balance. It is calmer than Gili Trawangan and has a bit more going on than the quiet Gili Meno. Whether you’re traveling solo or with others, this island is just laid back enough but also just social enough to be perfect either way. I have visited twice now, once in 2015 and again in June 2018, and while a lot has changed, the all-important vibe has stayed the same. If you’re heading to Gili Air, or trying to make a decision on which Gili island to choose, I’ll guide your way: This island is full of adventures – ones that everyone knows about and a few that many don’t realize are even options. Read on: The Gilis used to be a scuba diving mecca but after coral bleaching in 2010, it’s not as impressive as it once was. However it’s still home to plenty of sea turtles which makes it great for snorkeling, and it’s the only place around Lombok to learn how to free dive. I did a four day course with Freedive Flow and with their help was able to get down to 16 meters (52 feet!) and get certified with my AIDA 2. You can read my full review here. If you want to scuba dive, the Gilis are still a good place to learn. However if you already have your certifications and want to see something a lot more mind blowing, head to Raja Ampat or Komodo. For snorkeling, some of the coolest things to see are around Gili Meno, including the Nest sculpture. If you take a snorkeling tour, you’re going to be on the boat with a lot of other people. However the great thing about Indonesia is you can pretty much always work something out privately without it costing too much. My buddies and I once rented an entire snorkeling boat for a full day for $20 each between the five of us. If you can get a few people together, that’s my suggestion. We just asked the guy at our accommodation to organize it for us and the next day we were in business. If you want to do it cheaply and independently, hop on the public boat departing for Gili Trawangan at 8:30am and 3pm, arrive at Gili Meno in about 15 minutes, rent a snorkeling kit from the beachfront shop, and explore the underwater world that way. The same public boat will pick people up from Gili Meno at 9:30am and 4:15pm to head back to Gili Air. Note that you will be on Southeast Asia time, and the departure time depends heavily on sea conditions, so some delay is expected. A one-way ticket costs IDR 35,000, and tickets can be purchased at the Koperasi Angkutan Laut Karya Bahari office (check with your accommodation!). On the sunrise side of the island you’ll see stand up paddle boards for rent. For the most part the water is pretty waveless, though the current can be very strong. Currents and tides are always changing so be sure to ask which areas to avoid before you head out. I had so much fun cycling around this little island. You can rent a bike for as little as 30,000 IDR per day (like $2) and go all around and through the island. Gili Air is flat, and a little bit like a labyrinth, which made it so much fun to explore. You’ll want to rent a fat bike with big tires if you plan on heading around the west side of the island since it’s mostly sand, but otherwise a normal bike will do you just fine. Pro tip: if you have a headlamp, use it at night. Most of the bikes don’t have headlights. I spent every evening on Gili Air watching the sunset on the western side. Most of the open air bars out there play nice music and you can just take a walk and sit on the sand or grab a drink if you feel like it. Depending on the tide, it may be way out and you’ll see a bunch of tide pools. Be a bit careful walking through these as there are sea urchins. For the best spot, cycle out to the junction of Sunset Blvd and Jalan Pelangi Sunset View. Word got out about the famous sunset swing in Gili T and now just about every bar on Gili Air has a swing or hammock, too. Go for whichever place has the music you like best and enjoy! Aura Bowls: This is the cheapest place on the list and was also my favorite out of everything I had. The menu consists of mostly Indonesian food with prices from 25 to 40,000 IDR. It’s super small with only one table and a bar to sit at but if you can get a spot, it’s so worth it. The green smoothie is super creamy and honestly one of the best green smoothies I’ve ever had, Probably thanks to the copious amounts of coconut cream. The urap-urap and curries are great, too! From Lombok: Both public and private boat transfers are available daily from early morning to late afternoon at irregular intervals, depending on the sea conditions. The main ports are Bangsal Harbor, Teluk Nara, Teluk Kode, and Sengigi. To do it cheaply and safely, head straight to the ticket office on the beachfront and purchase a ticket for the boat. There will be prices stated clearly on the wall. Avoid purchasing your tickets from people outside the ticket office, as touts and scams are very common. For the public boat, the boats leave when full and stop running at 5pm. During high season they leave frequently but in low season you might have to wait for a while. The crossing only takes 15 minutes and costs a few dollars, so during high season, this is my favorite option. For private boats, most companies have fixed schedules. Bluewater Express and Gili Getaway are two of the longest serving and most reputable companies. Note that luggage carrying service is NOT free and it is one of the scammers’ tricks. If you do need luggage carrying service, negotiate on the tip first. Finally, if you want to charter your own boat, it costs about $30 and takes 5 minutes to cross the channel. This is the quickest and most convenient option (and one I’ve done after 5pm). The best place to catch a boat is just before Bangsal Harbor. Ask whoever is driving you to take you to a charter boat. From Bali: There are a few departure points from Bali to Gili Air. The most popular port is Padang Bai, a shuttle ride away from the popular Kuta. The fast boats depart between 9am – 9:30am, so most people would spend the night in Kuta or Padang Bai itself, and leave early morning. You should be able to arrive at Gili Air in about 2 hours. There are also public boats departing from the same port for a fraction of the fast boats’ price, though it’s not the most pleasant nor safest option. From the southwest, Serangan Harbor also offer daily transfers to Gili Air. Another departure point is Amed, located in northern Bali, and Sanur, down south. All fast boats make a stop at Lombok before heading to the Gili Islands. Click here for the Bluewater Express boat schedules for 2018! The island has a different vibe depending on where you stay. In the area near the harbor, there’s a bit more activity and energy. In the middle of the island, you’ll have more of the hidden and quiet bungalows, but no views. On the sunset side, it’s a bit more laid back. These are a few good picks: Pink Coco: This is one of the best rated places on the island within the $100/night price range. Everything is pink, from the decor to the bikes and the bean bags on the beach. Like seriously it is a pink explosion! You’ve got access to a nice big pool, a sunset view, and plenty of Instagram ops. UnZipp: I stayed in this bungalow my first time in Gili Air and loved it. The outdoor shower and rooms right on the pool, surrounded by frangipani flowers, all had me swooning. Botanica: This is where I stayed earlier this month and for the price point, I thought it was perfect. The downside is there’s no pool or view, but the upside is the value for the money. Plus, it was right across from my dive school. Every time I go back to the Gilis I find myself looking for reasons why I need to go back. It’s just so laid back, without cars or gas stations. It’s perfect for chilling or learning a new skill in the water, and if a little partying is what you’re after, you can find that too. great post Le Satay Bar was our fave restaurant on Gili Air! Sooo delicious and vegetarian/vegan options too! I think I passed by that place. Thanks for the rec! Hey Kristin! A little late to comment on this, but I’m planning a ~6 month Southeast Asia trip that will include lots of diving. Do you normally bring your own dive gear for long backpacking trips? Hoping to bring only a carry on with me. Is renting gear usually pretty easy/affordable? Thanks! I definitely rent! I’m not one for healthy eating but that bowl thing looks amazing! Why not? Treat yo’self right! I just booked unzipp on Gili Air. Thanks for the reco!I know Gili T is known as a party island but I’m enjoying myself. Thanks for the recosnthere as well! Hey partying can be fun too! Hi there, thanks for the lovely info on Gili Air. My family and I are heading there next year and just found out its during Ramadan. I read that you were there twice and both times during Ramadan. Is the call to prayer heard throughout the island? We have two young children and just trying to find the best place to stay on the island. Also, did it affect the shops and restaurants? Thank you! Oh yes, you will hear the call to prayer loud and clear on Gili Air, and there’s not much you can do about it. Most shops and restaurants still cater to tourists during this time.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/vegan-indonesia/,Vegan in Indonesia: A Delicious Journey,Indonesia,"It’s time I told you: I went vegan a month ago. I posted about it on my personal Facebook page and had more comments to the extreme of one end or the other than I have had on anything I’ve posted like, ever. It came as a surprise to me that people would have so many feelings about it! This choice has been a long time coming. I’ve felt a bit weird about eating meat for a while, and each time I do have it, I feel like I could have been just as happy without it. I also want to be healthier and to offset my carbon footprint more, which is big from flying so much. This isn’t going to turn into a vegan blog, however I will be sharing my best vegan finds around the world from time to time. Even if you’re omnivorous and just want to introduce more vegetables into your life, I hope what you find here is helpful. One of the biggest reasons why I didn’t go vegan sooner is because I feared it would be really difficult when traveling. However I’ve come to find it has opened up a whole new world. In Indonesia, my first trip as a vegan, it was easy and delicious! Here’s what I learned about being vegan in Indonesia: Fermented soybean cake known as tempeh is a high-protein, delicious meat alternative. I used to eat it all the time in Indonesia before going vegan. It has the crunchy texture I wish tofu had and it is especially delicious when stir-fried with cashews! Expect to find tempeh and tofu in pretty much every local restaurant (warung) you visit. When you’re eating local, you can also expect to pay just a few dollars for an entire meal.  Without even trying to be, a lot of common dishes in Indonesia are vegan by default. Many of them are loaded with veggies and are delicious. I was relieved to find that I could go pretty much anywhere and find a dish that would work for me. The following are some really great ones: Urap-Urap: A Javanese salad dish of steamed vegetables mixed with spicy grated coconut, usually served with rice. Capcay: A stir-fry vegetable dish with origins in Chinese cuisine. The translation is ‘mixed vegetables.’ The dish usually comes with carrot, Napa cabbage, leek, and soy sauce. Gado Gado: This is one of my favorite Indonesian dishes. It consists of boiled vegetables and rice smothered in peanut sauce. Vegetable curry: Curry is delicious in Indonesia and I’ve enjoyed many a vegetable curry during my tenure there. Like Thai curries, yellow is the mildest and green is the hottest. That said, I’ve never found Indonesian food to be on the spice level of Thai food! Dairy isn’t a big thing in Southeast Asia, so that is easy enough to avoid. The biggest issues are going to be fish sauce, shrimp paste, and egg. Many dishes also come with a side of prawn crackers. I found that I couldn’t assume that just because the place listed something as vegetarian or vegan meant it actually was. It’s common to use shrimp paste or fish sauce as a seasoning or base for a lot of foods including all of the ones listed above. It’s also common to find it in sambal, the spicy hot sauce included with a lot of local meals. Often locals didn’t really get that using shrimp paste or fish sauce meant that the dish was no longer vegetarian, much less vegan. Eliminating foods by choice is a luxury in much of the world, including in Indonesia, so one simply has to ask and make sure – no big deal! Use the following phrases:  Apart from Indonesian food, there’s a nice variety of vegan options especially on Bali, the Gilis, and Kuta, Lombok. Bali receives more tourists than anywhere else in Indonesia and many of them are health focused, especially in Ubud. Click here for a full guide to the best vegan eats in Bali! On Gili Air, check out Pachamama for nourish bowls and organic food, and the Mexican place with a few things to choose from like raw vegan lasagna, which isn’t bad! In Kuta Lombok, I enjoyed the Chia pudding at Kenza, a coffee shop on the corner which also has soy, and almond, and coconut milk options for their espresso drinks. They’ve also got a variety of green juices and smoothie bowls with spirulina and other add-ins to keep your vitamin levels up. The Instagram shot below features a breakfast I had there with a beetroot, cacao, almond milk cappuccino! A post shared by Kenza Café, Lombok (@kenzalombok) on Jun 8, 2018 at 9:24pm PDT  Most importantly they have a raw chocolate cake that is to die for, so save room! I also love the jackfruit tacos at the Mexican in Town in Kuta. The tostadas are good as well, just remember to ask for them without the cream. If you’re a Horchata fan, they make a good one there. Overall, I was impressed by how easy it was to stay vegan in Indonesia. I suppose the options had always been there, but I never paid too much attention before. I didn’t feel limited, I could pretty much always find something at every restaurant, and it’s great that much of the local food is inherently vegan. I’m excited to see where this healthy lifestyle leads and I’m looking forward to making more vegan discoveries around the world! For those of you who come here to read about adventures and solo female travel tips, don’t worry, I’m still talking about that stuff too! However as part of a conscious lifestyle that includes traveling the world, I’m happy to make vegan food a new addition. Do you travel around the world eating a plant-based diet? What has your experience been like? I look forward to more of these posts. Although I’ve always found plenty to eat when traveling, I find that research ahead of time is VERY helpful! Agreed I got very lucky landing in a place where it was easy despite not planning much ahead of time, though I’ve been there so much I guess it’s kind of the same thing! Heck yes! Long-time vegan here. Super excited to read more about your delicious plant-based finds around the globe! Congrats on making the change. Thanks for supporting! It’s nice to find the others <3 Yay! Congrats on going vegan! I have been mostly vegan for the past 1.5 years and I am loving it! I’m vegan too; I am so happy for you! Could you make posts about vegan options in other countries? 🙂 That’s my goal! Will do as I travel more as a vegan. I recall finding great options in Peru too! I wasn’t vegan back then but loved vegan food so this was a natural progression 🙂 What an amazing news to read! I love your blog and follow your tips religiosly and now that you make that decision I kinda feel like proud, just want to say “that’s my girl” 😀I’m flying to Indonesia in July for 4 months and then Philippines for another 3 months, this post just came in the right time! AW awesome! You’re going to have an amazing time. Hey Kristin: Glad to see great support for your new diet on here and best wishes with it. When I started by vegetarian diet (mine is unusual, I limit my dairy intake, and rarely have egg products, but eat a bit of fish (avoid farm raised), but not only a few specific kinds for omega 3’s, so semi-pescatarian) 30 years ago (that long ago, time flies!) many people were like “how about your protein, your strength, your weight”?  I find it funny in your case because with this diet you might encounter similar strong opinions or “concerns” from others much like when you decided to live a life as a traveler/nomad, both very positive and not so much. And just like with solo female traveling, you will likely prove to everyone that it can be done with great success.In my case, I have a physical religiously every year and my healthy blood tests show that my vegetarian diet only supplemented with a one a day vitamin (which almost everyone I know takes, meat eater or not) is a good thing. I’m a guy so I can’t speak for this for women, but strangely enough I have always had lower than average iron, until I took my one a day vitamin with orange juice every morning which took care of that problem (the iron absorbs into the body in citrus). Calcium levels were never a problem either. On top of this, my weight is the same as when I was in college with the same fitness level and strength (except the usual aging process, watching the back more etc.). I never went vegan (although am close if take fresh salmon out), but I love fruits, legumes and vegetables by nature and encourage a vegan diet as long as you monitor yourself and supplement where needed. If you take medication or have certain digestive sensitivities, one should talk to someone about catering your vegan/vegetarian diet for that (e.g., peanut/nut allergies, soy allergies and the like), but it can work just like with meat eaters. I wish anyone the best of luck with it!As for reducing your carbon footprint, in addition to eating vegan, one should eat the local foods and reduce the amount of cooked foods you eat (strangely, I did not realize baking produces more emissions than stir-fry due to time for cooking, although don’t need to get that extreme about it!). Kristin gets additional points on that front!!  If one wants to reduce their carbon footprint, but don’t want to go vegetarian, you can help again by reducing cooked foods, eating local, and reducing your intake of lamb (the worst of them), beef, cheese (imported), pork, turkey and salmon (farm-raised) by 50% and you would reduce your carbon footprint by at least a third (based on average diet, more if you are big meat eater or knock out lamb and/or beef totally)!!  Plus combining that with a more active lifestyle and removing processed foods (further reducing footprint) and you are golden!Looking forward to what you find in your adventures. This has always been my concern with traveling where with my semi-kosher diet on top of it would make be more pure vegan eating out. My Thai friend and manager of a local Vietnamese restaurant told me to use the term “Jay” (Thai) and “Chay” (Vietnam/Cambodia), with some equivalent in China; however, I have heard that refers to what Buddhists eat which may not always be pure vegan. You are there on the front lines and would know more exactly what to do so future advice is welcome as a supplement to your solo adventure posts!! Calcium is actually something I’m worried about without having fortified milk substitutes. They’re just not really a thing here and I’d rather make my own oat milk without the additives. Are you getting it from your multivitamin? I get some of my calcium from green leafy vegetables, nuts (I love almonds) and soy products fortified with it (e.g. soy milk). I also intake a little milk and tiny bit of cheese. However, the 200mg of calcium from my multivitamin when taken with a full meal will absorb in your stomach acid and be sufficient for me if I wanted to go full vegan and had no access to fortified soy milk. As for you, 200mg calcium as part of a multivitamin with a full meal of any sort should be sufficient for you too as a woman. If you blood tests as part of a physicals show no history of problems this is especially true. Annual physicals are important anyhow for everything. When women reach into their 40’s and beyond calcium and vitamin D become more important (pre-menopause and later). However, in that case the multivitamins designed for women with higher calcium levels (e.g., 300mg) would be needed if you are vegan although if you can find soy milk fortified with it somewhere in your travels, that will help a lot. Hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions, let me know and if I can answer the question I will. I confirmed this info with my local pharmacist who are often better than doctors about vitamins and medications. Oh as for vitamin D if you are light skinned you can get that from just a little direct sun exposure every day! Oops. Made some typos at the beginning in one set of sentences (and one later but will let that go). This is what I meant: When I started my vegetarian diet (mine is unusual, I limit my dairy intake, and rarely have egg products, but eat a bit of fish (avoid farm raised), but only a few specific kinds for omega 3’s, so semi-pescatarian) 30 years ago (that long ago, time flies!) many people were like “how about your protein, your strength, your weight”? Penang in Malaysia is a fantastic place for vegan food. There’s even a vegan sushi joint. I was vegan for about 6 years and although I ate healthy I was unaware of a having a vitamin  B12 deficiency which caused healthy problems. Be sure to monitor it because it’s something that has affected many of my friends who have been vegan for a long time. I take supplements! Thanks for letting me know, both about the B12 and Penang! How unfortunate. Being a vegan is completely incompatible with being a “Travel Muse” for others who long to experience other cultures. What a shame. You had a great blog.  Please don’t travel to any other countries and try to force your veganism on your hosts. Not only will you insult the,, you also risk making other American travelers look worse than they already do (because of intolerant people like you). The only place you are now qualified to travel to and write about is California. Feel free to go throughout that land and be with your people. Enjoy the traffic too. I didn’t know that eating plants makes me intolerant.  I think leaving angry comments about someone deciding to do something nice for the planet is intolerant, though.  But just to clear things up, there are vegan locals in China, Thailand, Cambodia, Tibet, Malaysia, Singapore, and many other Asian countries, and lots of them. It’s part of their religious beliefs and they’d be anything but insulted that I’d enjoy their food with them.  In Berlin, and much of Europe, veganism is very common, and nobody minds here that I opt for plants. I found vegan restaurants in Peru, too, run by Peruvians.  It’s strange and sad that the response to this would be so strong and negative. It helps the planet, and causes no harm. Why do you care? Bye Felicia, we don’t need negativity around here <3 Hi Jake and anyone who responds this way (and FYI for everyone!): Everyone is entitled to their opinion and express it, but it is important to get your facts straight and you might feel less defensive about it. Here are the facts:1. California and vegans: For one thing, California is not the #1 vegan state in the U.S., yet the world. In terms of restaurants per capita, it is around #10! And Oregon rates #1 really. Leave California alone anyhow, it is a fun, beautiful place to visit and if you learn more about the state you will find your preconceptions are way off (e.g., the whole state isn’t San Francisco politically BTW, it was the state that brought us Ronald Reagan).2. Intolerance: Being vegan doesn’t mean being intolerant because you personally choose to eat a certain way. If you look down on “meat eaters” which I have experienced in my life with some vegans/vegetarians, then sure. Most by far are not this way, especially these days as it is part of the recent more mainstream being healthy movement. However, looking down at vegans and calling them names is just as if not more intolerant. Tolerance is about accepting differences and being polite about it when in an environment where such a eating habit is unfamiliar. It is all about respect and it goes both ways Jake.3. Kristin the Travel Muse:  Jake and others, if you want to know of what cool things to eat around the world, you have 5+ years and volumes of virtual pages of information and experiences she has as a meat eater. So many of her readers have alternative eating styles such as vegan/vegetarian and now by switching to this herself,  she can now ADD to her repertoire and be a genuine help for this sizable part of her tribe. Also, as a vegan she gets to feel like she has a whole new experience while returning to the same places, much like going back to a place in the summer versus the winter! Food is so important to travel. Take a look at her next post, how she can provide both a meat eater’s and vegan’s perspective by actually living as both! She is more the muse than less now.4. American travelers: The key to making a good impression in other countries is to be a good, respectful guest, not a certain eating style. While it is harder to eat vegan/vegetarian in some places than others, and it is understandable how mysterious it is for someone to limit their diet in places where people are struggling for their next meal, it is all about showing respect to your hosts and working around it the best you can. Kristin espouses respect to her hosts and has opened my eyes to traveling to places I would not have considered before by showing ways to help the locals there and leaving the place you visit better than before you came. Examples of what she has promoted include eating the local foods, trying at least a few words in the native language, looking for off the beaten path locales, respecting the environment by leaving a campsite in the same condition as it was when you came (Leave No Trace), not bathing/swimming in untouched water basins, behaving yourself (not partying too crazily, limit your alcohol intake) and so on. I’m sorry if Americans are portrayed less than favorably in some places, although I haven’t researched this to be sure about that. Americans tend to put themselves down a lot.  I hope, Jake or anybody else who has a strong feeling on vegan lifestyle and Kristin’s change get something out of this comment I made and for others some points to make to friends/family who might react in such matter. Don’t be afraid of veganism and most vegans aren’t doing this to make a statement, it is a style of living that has been around for centuries, if not millenia, and is being embraced now all over. The world is embracing the increased wave of global tourism and providing more options each year. Plus there’s the spike in food allergies in the world such as to peanuts and ever present dairy intolerance (which makes coconut milk an attractive option) on top of religious based diets that have been around forever. This is the world today and time to accept the change! Lastly, promise this is my last comment on this specific post! 🙂 Should’ve just let you respond, Gil. Bravo! Bravo to you, Kristin! You look like the picture of health, and science supports that the phytonutrients, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes abundant in Plant Based Nutrition will help you prevent the chronic degenerative diseases of heart disease, cancer, and Type 2 Diabetes, as well as other inflammatory conditions.  it is kinder to the animals and the environment. I went plant based / vegan following two early small treatable breast cancers in 2005 and 2008, and thus far, no recurrence.  PBN will also optimize your glow and energy. Plant Based Nutrition opens up a whole world of food choices , it is not limiting. I have not found it hard to travel and eat plant based; a little planning ahead can help; and shopping in the local markets to enjoy new fruits and veggies is a delight. Thanks Susan! So wonderful to hear it was so beneficial to your health. I’m doing it mostly for the health benefits too, but also find it’s another fun adventure too! Great new item!I’m a vegetarian for a long time, with barely no eggs and milk. I tried going vegan, but i found it very difficult, and my energy was low. I will definitely try it again in the future.Eating out is a challenge sometimes, even as a vegetarian, mostly with meat eating friends.I really look forward to reading more posts about your journey as a vegan and cool vegan spots al over the world!! So helpful that more places are adding vegan and veggie stuff to their menus. Hi Kristin Glad to see more and more people going the plant-based route and my congratulations to you Kristin. I’ve been around for 65 years, (look 15 years younger) am slim and still have the hair colour I was born with (light brown) I’ve been a vegetarian for 44 years, studied and practised macrobiotics since 1985 and am now vegan. I’ve travelled to many parts of the world including Africa, Europe and South East Asia and have had no problem eating plant-based food except when I was in Cambodia. All the best to vegans around the world. In Bail now, will be heading to Ubud and Gilis and Lombok. Had lots of Gado gado so far! Veggie, not quite vegan myself but thanks for all the tips this is great! I found Brazil, specifically Sao Paulo tough, lots of times I’d say ‘no meat’ and they’d nod along and give me something with chicken ? Yeah I think vegetarian still means fish and chicken are cool in much of the world which I find very confusing but it’s not my culture. I’m scared of returning to Patagonia with this diet. I recall few vegetables available due to the remoteness. Hey Kristin: Never been to Patagonia but from looking around solo traveler discussions I saw these vegetarian/vegan places from this one guy who also keeps kosher (so he would make sure there wasn’t any cheese, chicken etc. accidentally in there if it is not a kosher restaurant). Item number 4 I grabbed from Happy Cow (since Punta Arenas is an important spot so curious if something there) from a strict vegan critic that found only that place satisfactory. Maybe you can take food to go for your travels from these places? We depend on supermarkets when traveling too but can be a pain:1. El Living, Arturo Prat 156, Puerto Natales, Chile (vegetarian with vegan options, good rating)2. Curcuma: José Antonio Rojo 219, El Chalten, Santa Cruz, Argentina (they make boxed lunches for on the go, vegetarian with vegan options…not far from Fitz Roy)3. Ren Vegetariano: San Martín 298, 8400 San Carlos de Bariloche, Río Negro, Argentina (by the kilo, might be good for on the go? Kind on the northern border of Patagonia)4. Amaranta Tea House:  Avenida Cristobal Colón 822, Punta Arenas, Chile (not a vegan restaurant but have a separate vegan menu of 3 items which I guess is the best you get in this city, vegan burger with veggies, pad thai and risotto) Hope this is helpful next time you go there!?? If these aren’t areas you plan to hang out with, never mind!!! Wow thanks! The word meat in Brazil specifically refers to red meat, which is why you still got chicken! Meat =/= chicken. All the food looks delicious, I found being vegan was very easy in all of South East Asia, bar Singapore! I’m actually just veggie but I don’t like cheese so end up eating vegan a lot of the time. Chiang Mai had more vegan restaurants than I have ever seem in my life! More than London for example. It was a lovely surprise  I don’t like cheese either! People always look at me like I’m insane when I say that. Wow this post couldn’t have come at a better time. I have been vegan for 3 months now. I am currently in Vietnam but am planning a 2 month trip to Indonesia in a few months time and was wondering about the vegan options on the less touristy islands. Thank you for your awesome, informative blogs. I cannot wait for Indonesia. Happy travels. Yay so glad you found this then! Have fun! Congrats on your veganism! I’m an omnivore always looking at ways to reduce my meat intake (without subscribing to any one “way”) and it’s always great to see vegan options promoted. Anyone who sees “vegan” and takes it as an affront to themselves is a bit defensive in my eyes. There’s room for everyone on this earth and I salute you for making a challenging step towards a more environmentally friendly wy of living. I can’t see myself going full vegan in the near future but as someone who loves vegan food I’ll be keeping an eye out on your vegan posts. Cheers 🙂 Thanks so much Allison! Agreed I don’t see why it should bother anyone as long as I’m not on a soap box making anyone feel bad for their choices, which I wouldn’t do. It would be pretty hypocritical of me as someone who ate meat her whole life until now! Anyways anyone eating more plants is a win and I’m glad you’re looking forward to more vegan posts! <3 Hope you can come back to indonesian with other Delicious food kristin 🙂 This is so wonderful to hear, Kristin! I’m a long time reader, a long time traveler (32 countries in about the last 10 years. Only one stint of long term travel. The rest is all vacations from my full time job as a construction site inspector here in New York City), and a long time vegan (over 12 years and counting!). There is no better way to care for your health, the health of the planet, and the health of the animals then to live a vegan lifestyle. I applaud you. The haters should just take a hike! Can’t wait to read any and all food updates! Thanks Molly!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tips-for-traveling-solo-in-indonesia/,Tips for Traveling Solo in Indonesia,Indonesia,"Indonesia might be the most diverse country in the world to travel through. I didn’t realize it at first, but now returning from my fifth stint in wonderful Indonesia, I’m realizing how different each culture, landscape, food, and religion are across this archipelago. As a solo traveler, that makes Indonesia more enigmatic than the other countries in Southeast Asia. What works on one island won’t necessarily work on another. There are different things you’ll have to take into account depending on where you go. That said, the diversity is part of what makes Indonesia such a joy to travel through. After spending months there, this is what I learned about solo travel in Indonesia: As with anywhere in the world, some places are going to be better for solo travelers than others. It comes down to how likely you are to meet other solo travelers, how much infrastructure there is for tourists, and the wealth of activities. These are some of my favorites: Bali’s neighbor, Lombok, is what I believe people are picturing when they think of Bali. Lombok is still rural, most of the beaches are empty, and there’s plenty of good surf. If you read my other articles, you’ll know that I say when a place has a shared activity it draws lots of solo travelers in. This is the beauty of Kuta in Lombok. Don’t worry if you’re not a surfer, you can decide to learn, or just rent a scooter and adventure around the beautiful beaches. Don’t forget to check out the waterfalls up north too! The Nusa islands off of the southeastern tip of Bali are a must-see. They are each so different, with Nusa Lembongan attracting the most tourists, followed by the smallest, Nusa Ceningan with baby blue water that you got to see to believe, to my favorite Nusa Penida, the most rugged and rural of the three. The islands are gorgeous, the people are friendly, and it’s nowhere near as hectic as Bali. Try to give them at least four days if you can. Check out my full itinerary here. When you want to go to a place without roads or sounds of motors, check out the Gilis off the coast of Lombok. My personal favorite is Gili Air, which has a laid-back vibe. It’s the perfect place to learn how to freedive, chill on the beach while watching the sunset, and look for sea turtles. This can easily become a part of your Nusa islands and Lombok trip as the three form a triangle – easy! Raja Ampat is remote and has only recently opened up to tourism without special permits. It is also home to what might be the best scuba diving in the world. I went on a liveaboard dive trip there this year and absolutely loved the Robinson Crusoe feel of the islands, most of which are uninhabited. It’s also a perfect way to meet other solo travelers on a dive ship. You’ve got a built-in network of friends already! West Sumbawa is the least known and frequented place on this list but it is just starting to get on tourist’s radars. Accessible from Lombok’s east side, West Sumbawa is full of incredible photo ops, gorgeous beaches that truly don’t have anyone else around, and lots of waves for surfing. The beauty of it is even the most popular area, Yoyo’s, only has a few guest houses and restaurants. It’s easy to meet others because there are always people around to surf, but even if you’re not a surfer, there’s great diving and snorkeling too. Plus, the infamous Mt. Tambora isn’t too far away if you’re a hiker. If you’re feeling up to exploring something off the beaten path, this is it. Northern Sumatra is one of only two places in the world where you can see wild orangutans, and Bukit Lawang is the perfect hub. This little town on the river is one of the friendliest places I have ever been to. Everyone knew my name by the second day! I left a little piece of my heart there. To quickly give some history, Indonesia was located on a major trading route and had influences from all over the world throughout its history. The country is made up of several different cultures that eventually became one country of radically different people. Although Bahasa is the shared language, each island and region has its own local dialect, its own religion, and its own culture. What is considered perfectly acceptable behavior and attire on one island might be the opposite on another. Here are the main things to consider: ⁃ Modesty is important on predominantly Muslim islands such as Lombok, Sumbawa, Java.⁃ Bali has its own culture and religion which is rooted in Hinduism, Buddhism, and animism. You’ll find tantric retreats and nudist beaches there, and yet, on temples in Bali you’ll see signs that advise women on their periods not to enter. Apparently this is because of the different energy it introduces, however the world still has a long way to come in terms of equality!⁃ Parts of Sumatra and Flores are mostly Christian where covering shoulders and knees isn’t as important, however modesty is common for local women all over Indonesia. Blending in can only help you feel more at ease. Finally, you might notice you’re approached more as a love interest as a solo female traveler. There are plenty of wonderful men in Indonesia who are deserving of love and trust, just be aware of the ‘Kuta Cowboys.’ During all five of my visits to Indonesia I have traveled solo. In some cases I even hitchhiked. I generally find Indonesians to be friendly, welcoming, and helpful. It also goes quite a long way if you learn how to say hello and thank you, especially in the local dialect for whichever island you’re on. I feel safe in Indonesia, and it usually comes down to staying alert and listening to my intuition. Here are a few other things to keep in mind: ⁃ Stay away from locally made spirits. They’re often essentially rubbing alcohol and drinking them can have dire consequences. If you’d like to drink, I advise ordering a beer and opening it yourself or watching the bartender open it. This is good advice all around the world.⁃ If driving a scooter, make sure the brakes work before you rent it. Go a speed you’re comfortable with and never drive while intoxicated. These three things will go a long way in helping you to avoid any incidents.⁃ Don’t get intoxicated. Both men and women tend to run into an equal number of bad situations when overly intoxicated and especially alone, not just in Indonesia but worldwide.⁃ The currents are strong and the waves are powerful in Indonesia. I’ve learned this the hard way myself. Make sure you understand what you’re jumping into before you go for a swim. In general, being courteous, being respectful, and trusting your gut are all things that will keep you safe. The great thing about Indonesia is it attracts other solo travelers – especially if you stick to the places listed in the beginning of the article and branch out from there. I find that the best way to meet people is through an activity like diving or surfing, or striking up conversations at popular restaurants or cafés. There are great online resources as well. For solo female travelers, check out the BMTM Solo Female Traveler Connect on Facebook. There are lots of women heading to Indonesia who are looking for travel buddies!  I’ve found Indonesia to be quite simple to travel through. To get around locally, I use the Uber and Grab taxi apps. When those aren’t available you can usually bargain with a motorbike driver, called an ojek, to get around. Ferries and flights are easy too, especially if you fly with Garuda. Local airlines like Lion Air will require a local credit card so you’ll have to go through a travel agent. For ferries, you’ll probably see plenty of signs around one Island advertising the others nearby. If you’re in a less touristy area, googling your start and end destinations and ‘ferry’ will help you figure it out. If you’re comfortable on a motorbike, or think you want to give it a try, I find it’s the easiest way to get around as a solo traveler. To me it represents ultimate freedom for a price I find agreeable. The rules of the road aren’t the same as they are back home, but you’ll get into the flow of it. Just be defensive at first and wear your helmet. Traveling solo in Indonesia isn’t so different from traveling solo anywhere else in Southeast Asia. Thankfully it’s a part of the world that is pretty easy and very friendly to solo travelers. You’ll also see others who are on their own too, which makes it easier to meet others. This lovely island nation has certainly captivated my heart and has me going back more and more with increasing frequency. I hope when you go there, it does the same for you! good to hear that i another think in india has amarnath its  religious place in the world most of people came here to see worship you should go once Hi Kristin,I just left Bukit Lawang and loved it as well…third visit in three years. I agree about the people…the friend lost and smiliest people I’ve encountered!I’m in Pulau Weh now which is not too far from there.I’m saving all your Bali/Lombok posts for my next visit.As always thanks for your fantastic and helpful posts.Lisa How is Pulau weh?! I’ve heard about it through the years from time to time. I swear most recently it was a guy in Chiang Mai who lowered his voice and said, “I shouldn’t even be telling you this, but there’s this island in Indonesia called Pulau weh…” Hi, I think you are adding great value in people’s lives with your work. Keep it up. Thank you so much. I wish I had time to visit Indonesia while I was in southeast Asia. You make it sound so welcoming and friendly. Good tip about the local airlines wanting a local credit card, that is such a faff!  Yeah it’s becoming one of my favorite places for sure. I find it to be a friendly place 🙂 Nice blog very interesting places especially  Raja Ampat, West Papua was very wonderful place..I must visit thanks for sharing. Awesome blog! very interesting places especially Nusa islands was adventurous and peaceful place..I must visit. Thanks for sharing such an amazing article. Hi there, I’ve read your posts with great interest. I’m a solo female traveller in Indonesia for a month. I’m currently in Bali but looking to travel further east from here. I looked into the live-aboard trip that you recommended in a different post but it was sold out (and above my budget unfortunately) – is there any chance that you might be able to recommend an alternative? And if you were to choose one place to spend 2 weeks outside of Bali, where would you go? You’ve presented so many amazing looking places, I’m finding it hard to choose 🙂Hope you don’t mind sharing a few more tips 🙂ThanksNina Do you mean the Raja Ampat or Komodo liveaboard? I think that Wicked in Komodo is probably the cheapest liveaboard I can think of in the area, if we’re talking diving. I think Lombok and the Nusa Islands are awesome and so is East Java, since you’re close to both 🙂 So happy you explore Indonesia and share with us. Someday, you must go to visit  Papua! 😀 I’d love to! Hey, nice article. But one thing: Sumatra isn’t mainly Christian. It is mainly muslim, with a little exeption of Christians around Lake Toba 🙂 Thanks!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/freedive-gili/,Should You Learn to Freedive on Gili Air?,Indonesia,"I morphed from land shark to mermaid in four days on Gili Air. I couldn’t believe how difficult it was, and then how simple. Something had to click in my mind. Then, like magic, I could fin down to 16 meters on a single breath-hold. Most sports require strength and endurance, but freediving is different. Freediving is more mental than anything else I’ve tried.  The concept is to train yourself to get deeper and deeper on a single breath of air. Why would anyone want to do that? I’m glad you asked! Once I’d made that decision, choosing where to do the course came next. For those familiar with the blog, I’m in love with Lombok in Indonesia and the Gilis off the coast are known for good freediving courses. I went with Freedive Flow based on the positive reviews and because I prefer Gili Air to Gili Trawangan. It’s calmer and more chilled. I love me some chilled. Day one was about understanding why the body feels the urge to breathe even when oxygen levels in the blood are still healthy. Next we practiced a ‘static breath hold’ in the pool. My longest was 2:30, which surprised me! I figured I’d be up after less than a minute. So far, so good with the relaxation. Then we hit the open water, which was completely different. For me, it resulted in hitting a road block. You can see more in the video:  After a failed first day of trying to get down, I knew it came down to practice. Like most things, getting good at freediving would mean I needed more open water time. I had to shelf my frustration and keep trying. I hopped on my bike and cycled to the sunset, as I would every evening on Gili Air. It must be a rule written somewhere: There are no bad sunsets on this island.  Nothing can turn my mood around quite like a good sunset.  The next day I had similar troubles, failing to get past the first meter on my first three dives. For someone who is used to equalizing while scuba diving, it can be difficult to change techniques for freediving. I knew I had to change my approach. I floated face down in the water watching the light beams dart through the blue. I relaxed each part of my body starting with my eyes, moving down to my jaw, my neck, chest, arms, and onward. Relax, relax, relax. It was a ploy to distract my mind.  “This is just for fun,” I reminded myself, “there’s no competition here.” With the pressure off of my mind, I could finally release it in my ears. It was like a switch flipped and I could finally equalize. I got down to 7 meters, then to ten, and then to twelve. The next day, I made it down to 16, completed my rescue dive, and buddy dived several times as well. From one moment to the next it went from ‘can’t’ to ‘doing it!’ I can see now why freediving is addictive. It’s like entering into a new state of consciousness. The urge to breathe is fierce, and it takes mental strength to get over it. Thankfully it can be learned, and any healthy person can do it. I’m hooked now, and I know I can go deeper. That’s what I aim to do, little by little. I’m so excited to have taken this first step towards becoming a mermaid. If you’re tempted to try it for yourself, do it. I promise you’ve never done anything like it.  *This post was brought to you in partnership with Freedive Flow. Feelings towards mermaiding are my own.  That’s so awesome!  So what was the longest you held your breath?  The 2:30? Yep. Hi Kristin! Congrats on your success and getting certified for level 1! Very proud of you. I don’t know if I could take a test while videoing myself! 🙂 Clearing a mental block is never easy, it is by far the hardest thing for me to clear. BTW, a 2:30 static breath hold is so impressive on its own. I freak out my kids when at the pool. I drift down and sit on the bottom of the pool and close my eyes and relax there, so peaceful, and it can last 2-3 minutes, I can’t imagine holding it that long while in motion between the ears and the CO2 buildup. But you can learn apparently pretty quickly!  How long did you need to hold your breath to get down to 16m and back? How deep did you go with the rescue? That’s great to know heaven forbid your buddy in the dive has problems. What’s a good price for these courses and what should I look for in terms of accreditation so I can trust them to be qualified for this? Sorry for so many questions, but this intrigues me since I love to swim underwater (I like to go from one side to the other and back in the pool that way sometimes, although that takes me only 1 minute). Although any healthy person can do it, I imagine one must be properly trained (certainly to know when you do have to resurface versus your body just out of reflex wanting to breathe) and not try to do this alone and the company you went with sounds fantastic and has a positive, relaxing feel to them. I love how they tested you physically before moving forward, you always find the best places! And it is good to know how you pronounce “Air” in Gili Air. I love the puns and irony, learning to hold your breath in “Air” and “Air” means water in Bahasa Indonesia :)! I would look for AIDA, SSI or PADI which will be a standard requirement for certification. You go down to 10 meters to do the rescue, and I’m not actually sure how long it took me to get down to 16 and back. Not that long! They don’t want you to focus so much on numbers because then you forget technique and that’s what’s important and results in longer numbers. Hard not to constantly want to ask how far you went though! Courses usually cost at least a couple hundred dollars for an intro. Thanks Kristin for the info and advice. Makes sense to concentrate on a successful dive than numbers :). It’s not about ego and competition. Found a PADI/SSI certified place has just added free diving training just down the street (the only one in town now, maybe in the state), still getting their feet wet, but might consider it if they do well and expand to a full 2-3 day beginner course ($375 seems reasonable which is what they say it would cost)!  Best wishes for a successful Tonga dive with the belugas in August! That’s more than what it cost on Gili Air however I’d expect that since their operating costs would be higher in the States. I learned freediving at Freedive Flow, too! They have such a great, supportive vibe there. I swam with whales in Tonga but before I knew how to freedive – I’m sure those skills are going to make it even more amazing! How was it?! I’m sooo excited to go! Your article doesn’t go into too much detail, but it kind of sounds like you had trouble transitioning from Valsalva equalization to Frenzel equalization.  Is that right?  That exactly my problem 🙁 I completed a level 1 course and made it to 20m no problem, did the rescues, etc.  But I couldn’t actually pass the course b/c I couldn’t Frenzel and therefore had to pull myself down the rope and keep my head up to use Valsalva.  So, if you have any thoughts/resources on how you figured out Frenzel, please do share!  For now, my ‘freediving career’ is kind of on hold until I figure out Frenzel… I couldn’t do either. What helped me to master Frenzel was sealing off my throat and forming a pocket of air at the roof of my mouth with my tongue and pushing that upwards. You’ll see the sides of your nose bulge when you’re doing it correctly. It didn’t take long for it to become second nature.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/rumah-pohon-nusa-penida/,Review: Rumah Pohon Treehouse in Nusa Penida,Indonesia,"There have been many brilliant sunrises in my life, but it’s hard to top the one at the Rumah Pohon Treehouse in Nusa Penida, Indonesia. The way that the sun rose over the jagged islets, lighting up the entire bay in layers of orange, pink, and gold, all while I watched from the perch in the tree, I felt like a princess surveying my kingdom. Or maybe like Wendy from Peter Pan. Or Khaleesi, or something like that. Looking back now at the photos I wonder if it was all just a dream. It certainly felt like it while the moon shone over the water the night prior, nearly full, while the tree gently rocked to me to sleep. Was it the best place I stayed in Indonesia, or Nusa Penida? Far from it. Was it one of the most unique experiences I had on the trip? Undeniably, yes, it was. Read on for my full review of Rumah Pohon and how to enjoy it fully if you opt for the same experience: This must be the best sunrise view on all of the Nusa Islands. The treehouse is nothing short of dreamy, at least from the outside. There are three treehouses and they book out quite far in advance. I found it online in January and booked it knowing that I’d most likely be in the Nusa Islands in March – that’s how early I had to stake my claim. In high season in July I imagine it’s even more important to book ahead of time. It’s also important to book the one you actually want. When I showed up, they let me pick which of the two open treehouses I wanted. Of course I picked the one with the best view, #1, pictured above. There are two others on the same peninsula that are both newer and probably a bit nicer inside, though they’re all basic and what you’re paying for is the view and the experience. You can book treehouse #1 on Airbnb here, or here for #2, and here for #3. You can also get $25 off through this link. You can also book it via booking.com and get $30 off through this link. It’s overpriced for sure. There’s a lumpy double bed, a fan, a narrow bench on the balcony that’ll make your bum go numb after 20 minutes, and not much else. The bathroom isn’t very clean, it’s not a private, secluded experience, and every move I made caused the tree and the bungalow to sway back and forth. When I compare it with the AirBnB I stayed in earlier in the week on the top of the island which could have slept six people, had two bathrooms, was incredibly private, had an epic view of Mt. Agung, and gorgeous gardens for only a few dollars more per night, the value just isn’t there for the treehouse (you can read more about the other place and get my full Nusa Penida itinerary here). I know this is to be expected, but since it’s so popular, people were asking constantly if they could come and take photos on the steps. I didn’t mind and I always said yes, until it was 5:45 AM and someone bounded up the steps shining a flashlight in the door. It scared the crap out of me! That said, it was private at night, watching the moonlight over the bay. I also had access to it at sunrise which you can really only count on if you rent it. Otherwise, you can expect that the other people who rented it will be using it for their sunrise photo shoot.  It’s a bit of a hike to get down to the treehouse, but don’t worry about carrying your stuff down the steps, the host will do it for you. There’s nothing on the peninsula except for the three treehouses and a bathroom, so you’ll need to bring your own food and water down with you. There’s a warung with fried noodles, soup, and fried rice at the top where you can buy some food to take down, though you’ll want to eat it quickly or seal it in a Tupperware or jar as you’re sharing your space with ants and other critters too, potentially. The best way to get to the treehouse, and around Nusa Penida in general, is by motorbike. It takes about an hour and a half to two hours from the port area to get to the Rumah Pohon area as it’s on the opposite side of the island, though the drive is beautiful. The roads are steep and pretty rocky and broken in places, so if you’re inexperienced or nervous on a motorbike, you can ask Artem, the owner, to organize transport for you. The Rumah Pohon Treehouse was an adventure to say the least. Would I stay there again knowing what I know now? The photographer in me says yes, mostly for the opportunity to photograph it at sunrise. If that doesn’t matter much to you and you want to climb down just to see it and take some photos, that’s entirely possible too. Of course, it’s up to whoever is staying at the treehouse at the time if they’ll let you walk up the steps to take photos or not. I don’t feel like it’s a great value, and it’s probably only worth staying there for just one night (I actually booked two and only stayed for one), but with the following discounts you can save a bit on your stay (they also provide me a small commission at no extra cost whatsoever to you): You can book treehouse #1 on Airbnb here, or here for #2, and here for #3. You can also get $25 off through this link. You can also book it via booking.com and get $30 off through this link. Happy adventuring on Nusa Penida! Thanks for the honest and open assessment of this place, both positive and not as positive, with some good humor added in. Also, haven’t used Airbnb before, so thanks for offering an even higher discount ($40) for that! Gosh!This is amazing, the picture of sunrise is just breathtaking ?Lucky you Kristin!! Hey, the links don’t seem to work except for Booking.com and it doesn’t specify which treehouse… any ideas on how to book the treehouse #1 as you mentioned? Hmm, each of the Airbnb links are working for me! Maybe give it another try? Weird question tho, but was there a lot of spiders? 😂 Really want to book this, but not so keen on sharing bed with spiders 🙈 Bugs of all kinds can’t recall spiders specifically. Kristin – thanks for the review and all your other posts on this site.  I’m headed to the island (and the treehouse) in a few months.  What kind of drone do you use? It’s a Mavic 2 pro. Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/indonesia-itinerary/,The Ideal Indonesia Itinerary for 2 Weeks to 2 Months,Indonesia,"When the sun rose over the volcano caldera, lighting up the sky in shades of orange, pink, and yellow, it illuminated the electric blue lake and the blue flames of the volcano faded into the light. I looked at the French guy next to me, whom I’d met during the hike up with the stars, and we smiled in unison. That moment would feature on the highlight reel of my life. This wasn’t the first time an experience in Indonesia would make that reel. There were the Manta rays in the water, the orangutans swinging through the trees and the friendly people who all made me realize, there’s something magnetic about Indonesia. It’s so much more than just Bali. The first time I visited Indonesia I budgeted six weeks thinking that would surely be enough to see all of the things that I wanted to see. I quickly came to realize that Indonesia is huge and that each island has its own unique food, culture, language, and often its own religion as well. Therefore each island is a destination in itself where one could spend months or years. I say this not to discourage, but rather to help create some realistic expectations for your Indonesia itinerary. There are literally thousands of islands in the world’s fourth most populated country spanning close to 2 million square kilometers (over 735k square miles). With that in mind here are some itinerary suggestions for 2 weeks to 2 months in Indonesia: If you only have two or fewer weeks, I strongly suggest picking one or two regions and doing them justice, like only Lombok and Bali, or only Flores and Raja Ampat. Each are so special in their own way and in such a big country, it could otherwise feel like all you’re doing is rushing and moving around. Here’s a great option: Fly into Medan and take a bus bound for Bukit Lawang. This will take most of the afternoon. Avoid Medan, really, there’s nothing to see there. Book a day trek into the jungle to see the Orangutans. These are best organized with guides who grew up in the jungle and know how to track the Orangutans without offering them food. More on how to do that here. Spend a day in Bukit Lawang before or after and inner tube down the river, enjoying the company of the incredibly friendly locals. Bus back to Medan and fly out to Bali. While most visitors to Indonesia flock to Bali, I tend to avoid it since the traffic can be hectic and many of the areas are Westernized, which I like to avoid when I travel. That said, Ubud and Canggu are traveler favorites and Keramas is a personal favorite of mine, and since Bali is so easy to fly into, consider spending a couple of days in one or the other before moving onto the Nusa Islands. Take a ferry from Sanur to Nusa Lembongan or Penida and spend 3 days exploring these lovely islands – visit gorgeous beaches, snorkel with Manta rays, learn to surf, or chill at one of the many beachfront pools and cafes. From Lembongan, it’s easy to ride a motorbike over the bridge to Ceningan for a day trip, or consider staying on Ceningan for a more laid-back vibe. This is popular with surfers as well and boasts much smaller crowds than Bali. Click here for the perfect Nusa Islands itinerary. Just a 2-hour fast boat over from the Nusa islands, or a short flight over from Bali, Lombok is yet again wildly different from the other islands you would have experienced with this itinerary, and well worth experiencing. Lombok is much quieter, more rural, and rugged. You’ll have to make some choices here between the Gili islands just off the coast, trekking the Rinjani volcano, which usually takes 3 days and 2 nights, or heading down south to Kuta for some gorgeous beaches and surfing. There are also incredible waterfalls all over Lombok to check out. The adventure there can be endless. This guide can help you pick and choose which activities on the island call to you the most. That’s one of many possible adventures for 2 weeks in Indonesia, though if you keep reading, you can pick and choose more options below.   You’ve got a full month in Indonesia – fantastic! You can take a bit more time in each place and rush around a little bit less. I also highly suggest adding diving into your itinerary, as Indonesia has some of the best in the world, truly! Repeat the 2-week itinerary, but give yourself more time in each place and expand it to 21 days, spending extra time in Sumatra and adding in Pulau Weh for a quiet, secluded island or Lake Tobah to stay on an island within a lake within an island (say that ten times fast), or spending more time on Lombok so that you can enjoy the beaches, do the Rinjani trek, see the waterfalls, and spend some time on the Gili islands. From there, this itinerary can go one of two ways – the diving route or the volcano route. If you’re into diving: If you go this route, reverse Lombok and Bali and fly into Lombok from Medan, Sumatra. Spend time enjoying Lombok, then fly or boat to Bali and after a few days there, head to the Ubung bus terminal and buy an onward ticket to Bondowoso, ferry included. Traveling to the base of Kawah Ijen will take most of the day. Once on Java, we’ll head to Kawah Ijen, the experience I referenced in the opening of this post, which still ranks at the top of my list over five years of travels and adventures later. Kawah Ijen is famous for its blue flames and the amazingly strong sulfur miners who carry loads up and down the volcano all day and night. Hike in with the stars to see the flames and watch the sunrise from the crater rim. More on how to do it independently of a tour here. Next, take a bus to Surabaya via Probolinggo and onwards to Cemoro Lawang to trek or drive to the Bromo volcano for sunrise – one of the most famous volcanos in Indonesia. More on how to do that here. From there, bus back down to Surabaya and bus or train to Yogyakarta to see the Borobudur temple. This temple was built in the 9th century and represents a mix of Buddhism and ancestor worship. It’s a unique temple in Java that you won’t see a match for in the rest of Southeast Asia. From there, fly out of Yogyakarta home or to your next destination. OR It’s hard to beat Indonesia when it comes to diving and though there are many places with fantastic dive spots, Komodo and Raja Ampat reign supreme. Komodo is a bit cheaper and easier to get to, flying into Flores and hopping onto a dive boat from there. The corals are fantastic, Manta rays are regularly sighted, and the scenery is gorgeous as well. Plus, you get to see the famous Komodo dragon on Rinca, the island pictured above. For more on diving Komodo, read here. Komodo’s main season is April through December, though you can dive there year round. If you’re in Indonesia during the rainy season, consider spending a bit less time in Bali, or cutting out Sumatra, and spending 11 days to two weeks in Raja Ampat, flying into Sorong, West Papua. While it’s possible to get on a dive boat in Komodo for just three or six days, most dive trips in Raja Ampat are longer, and it does tend to be more expensive. That said, the abundance and diversity of fish is mind-blowing, and the corals are varied, plentiful, and vibrant. Plus, the islands are incredible too. It’s easily one of the best trips I’ve ever been on. Read more on diving in Raja Ampat here. Note that both Komodo and Raja Ampat have notoriously strong currents and are better suited to divers with some experience. You should have at least your advanced open water before getting on a dive boat in either place. Nitrox is advised. With two months in Indonesia you can take a bit more time in each place, planning ahead much less and opting to spend extra days or even a week here and there in the places that call to you the most. For this itinerary I suggest allowing for more fluidity, with a few key things planned out in advance such as flights and diving. Spend more time in the jungles, on Lake Tobah, or on Pulau Weh. To truly head off the beaten path, head south on this giant island and explore the jungles. Given how much there is to do on and around Lombok and Bali, slow down, take a bit more time to explore, and take yoga classes, go for hikes on the volcanoes, learn to surf, attend a retreat, or just park in a bamboo bungalow for a week and hang at the beach. It’s easy to slow down and spend a good chunk of time in this area. My particular favorites are the mainland of Lombok, particularly Kuta’s beaches, and the Nusa islands. Explore the volcanoes and temples of East Java, or go the other direction and check out Sumbawa, a truly off the beaten path gem that’s perfect for beach bums and especially surfers. For a wave that has almost nobody else on it, a beach with only a few huts, and the type of tourist who tends to stay for 2-3 months on just this beach, look no further than Sumbawa. This is the next hidden paradise that almost nobody knows about. This is the spot that is only starting to get on the radar of surfers in the know. To get there, the easiest method is a boat with Ozone Adventure from Kuta Lombok. If you’re a diver, then you absolutely must experience Komodo, Raja Ampat, or both. These are easily the best spots for diving in Indonesia and each has the small stuff, the big stuff, and incredible corals. Scroll up to the one-month itinerary for more information on how to get to each and who to book dives with. With that, you will have had an incredible trip in Indonesia, both in the popular places and in plenty of off the beaten path spots as well. It’s the perfect mix in a country that delivers high value for your money and has great food and friendly people to boot. Keep in mind this itinerary still only covers a small part of a huge country. There’s also Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Sumba, West Java, West Timor, and so many more! After the four months I’ve spent traveling around Indonesia I still feel I’ve barely scratched the surface, and my list just keeps getting longer! What are some of your favorite places in Indonesia? What a great summary of what you have learned and discovered over your 5+ years of traveling at this locale. If anyone talks with me about traveling to Indonesia, I will send them over to this post. Also, this was very well written, you clearly put some effort on this and it shows! Great itineraries! I’ve never been to Indonesia, and I doubt I’ll go there for longer than 3 weeks at a time so the first itinerary sounds perfect to me! Diving with manta rays would be a dream 🙂 Great guide! Will definitely be using this when we are in Indonesia!! This guide has helped me shape my itinerary to Indonesia in April and I am so excited! I am doing 6 days at a retreat in Canggu, and then have 6 days to spend in Ubud, Gili Air, Nusa islands, or some combination. Would you recommend splitting the time or just choosing one? I might pick just one set of islands as well as Ubud. The Nusa islands get the slight edge over the Gilis for me 🙂 If you start from Jakarta, then take a train or bus to Bandung to see kawah putih, then to Yogyakarta to see prambanan and borobudur temple, have some fun in cave pindul,  after that go to jepara by bus to go to Karimunjawa Island to have snorkling,  go to east java trakking to kawah ijen,  baluran, menjangan,  go to nusa penida bali, next go to lombok island to see gili and the pink beach,  then sailing komodo tour in labuan bajo,  after that have an overland tour in flores, go to sumba island and Timor Leste. I’ve been researching Indonesia and your website has been very useful—thank you! I had a quick question—did you take anti-malaria pills when you went east of Bali (Nusa Islands, Lombok, Komodo Island, etc.)?  I see that the CDC lists Lombok, for example, as low risk. I was just curious what you did, given your robust experience/time in the area, and as a female traveler:) I have never taken anti-Malarials in Southeast Asia. I do in Mozambique and other countries where the strains are particularly lethal. However that’s just my preference and I don’t want to give advice on whether one should or should not. You can still get Malaria in Southeast Asia, and also Dengue, I just don’t want to be taking those pills for that long.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/wild-atlantic-way-galway-donegal/,The Best of the Wild Atlantic Way from Galway to Donegal,Ireland," There are so many places in this world, sometimes it seems silly to go back when there is so much left unexplored. Then again, it’s silly not to go back when you love a place so much that you know you need to explore more of it, isn’t it? That’s what Ireland is – a place worth going back to over and over. It’s the greenery of the rolling hills, the sea cliffs that, on a clear day, provide views of the other side or even other islands. It’s the hospitality and the humor that keep me coming back. …and the oysters too. MAN I love oysters. This time it was all about exploring a new part of the Wild Atlantic Way, a road that wraps around the island and is the longest coastal drive in the world. While it’s always been there, it’s only lately that it’s had this name and become popular, and the little towns along the way are still quaint and small, and some of the roads still small and winding. From Galway to Donegal, here’s the best of the Wild Atlantic Way (IMHO): The Wild Atlantic Way is famous in part for the food. Chefs are taking Irish cuisine to a whole new level, showcasing local seafood, lamb, and beef. The dinner at Ard Bia, a restaurant just under the Spanish Arch, was the perfect introduction to this food culture. Trust me on this one: The lamb croquettes and steak are heaven. Plus, the bartender liked Steve and my corny jokes. Nobody likes Steve’s jokes, so this was pretty cool. (juuuust kidding, Steve). Stay: The House Hotel – the location is great and it’s all pretty in pink. From Galway to Clifden you can take your time and drive along the coast or do a straight shot. The coast has some great stops so despite the fact that it is quite narrow in places and with lots of turns, it’s worth driving along it and stopping from time to time. The first stop for us was just north of Galway at a beach called the Silver Strand. There were kite surfers and even a swimmer in the water! I couldn’t believe my eyes. The receptionist at the House Hotel had also suggested that we stop at Two Dogs Bay on the way up, which was a stellar beach as well, with white sand and light blue water over black rocks. I suggest taking your time on this drive, watching out for the Wild Atlantic Way signs and pulling off whenever something looks like it could have potential. Clifden was the stopping point for the day where we took a walk through the bogs and through history with a local guide who told us about the landing spot of the first trans-continental flight, as well as one of the first and largest radio receivers in history. It’s always nice having a local tell you about his home, isn’t it? Stay: Clifden is a good stopping point for the day since the drive up from Galway, especially with stops, can be pretty long. I stayed at the Quay House and it’s one of the quirkiest and funkiest places I’ve been. Each room has a theme, including the Napoleon room or mine, the blue room: Plus, they had oysters on the menu, for breakfast! You had me at oysters. Upon leaving Clifden, the Sky Road, which only takes about 20 minutes to drive, offers some gorgeous views. Or at least I’m sure they would normally be pretty gorgeous, but it was a misty and cloudy day for us. I still enjoyed the drive anyway, and that’s Ireland, after all. Next you’ll come to Kylemore Abbey, which was a highlight for me. I’d seen a photo of this famous Abbey when I was younger and painted it for my grandmother, who had also traveled through Ireland (and much of Europe and the rest of the world), so it had sentimental value as well. That’s when I started to really appreciate the mist: Entrance to the Abbey is €14, which includes the gardens, the church, and the walkway pictured above. You can still get the iconic photo of the Abbey from the bridge, without the entrance, if that’s all you’re after. There’s also a short but steep hike to a statue of Christ just above the Abbey if you feel like getting your sweat on. From there we made our way to Killary and took a fjord cruise, amazed that during low season, we had the boat to ourselves! There were so many little streams coming down each of the seaside cliffs, it looked like mini waterfalls on the changing orange grasses, dotted with sheep. On a lucky day you can see dolphins as well. Stay: From there you can head inland a bit to Delphi Resort and Spa, which is situated in a gorgeous little valley near the tallest mountain in the area (at just over 800 meters). It’s family friendly and their seaweed bath had my skin feeling like it had reverse-aged about 20 years, it was so soft!  The next morning you can either take the coastal route or the route through the mountains, which is what we did, and found a few perfect little photo stops along the way: For lunch I suggest you make your way to Westport which is building a name for itself as a foodie spot. What I loved about it is the nature of the locals there, who emphasize working together to achieve success with tourism, their main industry. When Steve and I took the food tour there, sampling soft local baked goods, delicious craft beers, mussels, crisp apples, and super flavorful homemade pesto and hummus, locals kept recognizing our guide and joining us. By the end there were 6 of us altogether, which, to me, so perfectly illustrates what I love about Ireland – the friendliness and the feeling that everyone is practically family. You can contact Redmond for a tour here. For the night, we stayed at an inn connected to a pub in a tiny town south of Sligo called Templeboy. This is the type of place where you can really feel Irish friendliness and hospitality. Within a few minutes of walking in there was a group playing the fiddle (and very well I might add), and a group of guys who invited Steve and I to join them for two pints of Guinness. Honestly, where else do you walk into a pub and you’re everyone’s new best friend? It happens all the time in Ireland! Stay: Templeboy Beach Bar, particularly room 9 which has a nice view of the beach and cliffs of Sligo. When passing through Sligo, Strandhill is a popular stop to watch the surfers. Steve and I were on a mission to make it to Slieve League and then ownard to Derry for Halloween the same day, so we bypassed it but if you have the time, definitely stop by. Mullaghmore is also an absolute must. Steve and I actually drove up there for sunset and then back down to Templeboy for the night, which doesn’t make any sense logistically, but we wanted to make the most of the gorgeous sunset unfolding given that we’re photographers and that kind of thing is how we get our kicks. It would be stunning at any time of day, though. Then it was onwards to Slieve League, which is a must-see. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Nov 1, 2016 at 10:20am PDT  If you saw and loved the Cliffs of Moher, and especially if you didn’t Slieve League is equally as impressive: They’re Europe’s tallest sea cliffs, and at least at the end of October, were free to view. That night we made our way to Derry, Ireland’s only walled city, for the Halloween festival:  If you have the time, it’s so worth road tripping through Northern Ireland as well, with towering basalt columns at the Giant’s Causeway, gorgeous beaches, and Game of Thrones filming locations which, even for someone who isn’t a fan of the show (I don’t watch TV or movies because I have no attention span), were a delight. Those are a few of the best (of many, of course) great stops between Galway and Donegal in one of the friendliest and greenest countries in the world. Sit back and enjoy the twists and turns and narrow roads, driving on the left and self-fiving yourself for getting better and better at it with each passing day. A road trip down the Wild Atlantic Way is an adventure you’ll never forget. *This post is brought to you in partnership with Tourism Ireland who helped me experience yet another part of the Wild Atlantic Way. Opinions of Ireland, a country I’ve happily returned to 5 times and expect to visit many more to come, are my own. Loved this post! Personally my favourite part of the WAW is from Galway to Kerry but the views in Donegal are pretty insane! I haven’t gotten to explore it as much as you have but your pictures make a pretty convincing argument for me to plan a trip there! Didn’t make it to Kerry but adding it to the list now! Thanks for another great post, and for taking me into the northern part of the Wild Atlantic Way! On my around the world journey I was lucky enough to cover the south-western part and it was amazing , but time ran out & I missed the north – looks like it’s worth a trip back…http://www.travelynntales.com//?s=Ireland+&x=0&y=0 I did the same a few years ago. It’s good in bits and pieces too! Im from Ireland and its so nice to see people enjoying our countryside!  We take it all for granted but when someone else shows us their photos or opinions of the country, it reminds you just how beautiful Ireland is.  I only recently did the Wild Atlantic Way myself and loved every second of it!   The Burren, Kerry and West Cork are all instagram ready too…absolutely gorgeous! I love reading other people’s opinions of where I’m from too! It’s nice to see things from a visitor’s point of view. Glad you like the photos! Off in a few weeks back out to the WAW and headed up to stay with friends in Donegal for a month or so cannot wait. I think Donegal is truly my favourite area of Ireland although a housesit for 7 weeks in Tipperary almost had me convinced to move there…lol… I love the wild rawness of Donegal and the lack of tourist and people most of all it allows me to breathe and that is so wonderful That part of Ireland is really nice for heading off the beaten path a bit and being around locals, for sure! Would you mind suggesting a itinerary for Ireland like you did for Iceland? I follow your guide for Iceland and loved it! Thanks! This is my best one for this part of the coast, and you can find my northern ireland one linked in there as well, however I haven’t traveled the whole country so it’s hard for me to comment on the rest of it! this has made me so excited as we are doing the same for my 50th in october, wonderful and helphul, thanksjo from manchester Have fun! We’re travelling to Ireland for the first time this coming June. We only have 10 nights, and are starting and ending in Dublin. We need to visit Northern Ireland (Bangor), since that’s where my family was from, and originally the reason we are going. Now that I’ve been studying Ireland, I realize how much more of it I want/need to see. What a beautiful Island. We’re just trying to figure out a route for our 10 night stay. Everywhere looks like heaven to me, and I know that 10 nights is not nearly enough. I can say that hopefully I’ll be back, without even having gone yet. I did this route in about a week, in case that helps! You can drive back down to Dublin via a more major highway instead of the WAW and get it done in a few hours. I was planning on going to Derry for halloween this year and I am so happy I saw this post beforehand. I would love to do this road trip there! Do you think this drive would be doable for a single female? It sounds like everyone you met was very friendly so that gives me hope! Yeah I’d definitely do it solo! Kristen, Love Your Photos!Came across your blog while researching for our family trip to Ireland in 3 weeks.  I spent a couple of years traveling solo across Asia and Nepal early 2000s, but now traveling with hubby and 2 kids….sodoing a bit more planning this time 😉We have about 10 days for travel before heading to a wedding in Connemara.  So many amazing choices and so little time!  Hubby is a lover of nature and rocks, not a fan of lots of people or tourist sites.  I’m thinking of forgoing the Ring of Kerry and Cliffs of Moher to take the road less traveled and follow your route N of Galway to Derry!  Thanks for posting all this info and  the photos 🙂 You should have more solitude on this route. Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/game-of-thrones-tour-ireland/,I Became a Game of Thrones Character in Northern Ireland,Ireland,"Are you a Game of Thrones lover? If you are, keep reading. Or are you more like, “why does everyone love this darn show so much?! It’s basically soft core porn, but with more death and incest”? If you are, keep reading because you don’t have to love the show to appreciate the beauty of Northern Ireland. In June My friend Steve needed some help shooting a documentary about the various Game of Thrones filming locations and I offered my assistance because I am a kind and giving person like that.* (*Because Guinness tastes better in Ireland and I have been dying to go back ever since I left) I honestly don’t really watch TV or movies, a source of much frustration for my friends on a lazy evening in, and thus am not usually a TV or movies tour type. I did, however, catch the first season of Game of Thrones on a flight between Europe and the US last summer, and therefore wasn’t completely in the dark. Yet even if I had never seen an episode, it was the pleasure of exploring Northern Ireland that I was after, which is quickly becoming the place of traveler’s dreams as its dark history fades into the past. I’m referencing the three decade-long period of conflict in Northern Ireland that began in the late 1960s and lasted until the Belfast “Good Friday” Agreement of 1998. The struggle was mainly a political one rooted in religious and ethnic differences between parts of Northern Ireland’s nationalist community (principally Roman Catholic) and unionist community (principally Protestant). On paper the disagreements and conflicts stemmed from Northern Ireland’s status as part of the United Kingdom and anti-Catholic discrimination in housing, employment, policing, and voting. The fighting resulted in nearly 4,000 casualties, many of which were civilian. the Good Friday peace agreement “ended the violent conflict in Northern Ireland by creating a power-sharing government and serves as a positive example worldwide for handling ethnic conflict” (via NPR). I mention this because for many people, the fear of visiting Northern Ireland remains due to its history but is largely unfounded. The Northern Ireland I saw was the well-built industrial city of Belfast, lovely beaches, and gorgeous countryside. What additionally stood out to me was the friendliness and sense of humor of the locals. This is something I’ve encountered in countries with similar recent histories such as Cambodia and Sri Lanka as well. So if these photos tempt you to visit, go knowing that you’ll be safe. After all, the Northern Ireland of today is where dragons, Khaleesis, and Kings roam. Take a look:  A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jun 16, 2015 at 7:20am PDT  The first day started here with a bike ride through the forest and, most importantly for me, dressing up in a cape and running around with a foam sword. As Steve explains in the documentary, several scenes from the beginning of the series were shot here. Plus, all this really cool stuff: I had no problem remembering Castle Ward as the filming location for Winterfell as it appeared quite a bit in the first season, and is where Bran was memorably (except for him) pushed out of a window. I, however, will always remember it as the place where I learned how to shoot with a bow and arrow: And where I ran around in a cape (again) because I can’t get enough of dress up time. The guide for Tollymore Forest and Castle Ward was Winterfell tours – highly recommended if you want to do something similar. The owner, James, was a great guide and host! Prices for the archery start at £25 per person, including costumes. Cushendun is a massive cave where, in the show, the shadow assassin was born. I liked it even more after learning that because how badass does “shadow assassin” sound?! At around 3:00 in the video you’ll see our next guide, Phil with McComb’s Tours, who took us around to all of the filming locations over the next couple of days (tours start at £35/person/day). He was, without a doubt, the best guide I’ve ever had. For anything. Ever. Given he normally drives the cast and crew during filming, he was the perfect person to show us the remaining locations. He’s also just nice to be around, and we spent the whole time joking, poking harmless fun at each other, and enjoying the beauty of the Northern Irish coast. I don’t often talk up tours, but this one is well worth it, mainly because of Phil and how knowledgable he is about the history of the area and the lore from the show. This was my favorite stop of the second day and maybe of the whole trip. It was such a clear day standing atop the cliffs of Murlough Bay that it was possible to see Scotland clearly across the ocean. It was so blue and so green, I actually had to take the saturation down when I edited the photos that evening. It was truly the Ireland of dreams and movies, (and TV shows, as it were). Though not a filming location, no trip to Northern Ireland is complete without visiting the Giant’s Causeway. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage site that was formed by volcanoes, or, depending on what you believe, feuding giants. A tip from Phil: Most people think that it’s necessary to pay an entrance fee to visit the rocks, but the fee only grants access to a visitor’s center and isn’t required to see the rest of the area. If you ask me, that’s a needless expense. They’re also open any time, so get there before the busses start running at 9am. Steve and I arrived at around 8:30 and walked the whole 12 minutes down (easy peasy) and had them nearly to ourselves until 9 o’clock. Ballintoy Harbour was another highlight for me. I love a cloudy, rugged beach and it was just gorgeous with the various colors of moss, seaweed, and wild flowers. It was once a small fishing harbor and a processing area for the rocks from a nearby quarry back in the day. Up until recently, it wasn’t on the tourist radar. Thanks to the show, now more than just the locals know about it. As they should, because it’s so impressively beautiful. The causeway coast was also a destination in itself, and the drive along it is gorgeous: Yet another place that was rather unknown prior to becoming a GoT filming location (for only a few seconds when Arya Stark escapes King’s Landing), the Dark Hedges is now a favorite amongst photographers. The hedges are one street lined with intertwined beech trees that were planted in the 18th-century. The perfect time to catch them looking their finest is at sunset. Despite not being a huge fan of the show, mainly because I was talking about myself earlier when I mentioned that I’m most likely watching YouTube videos about slow motion while binge-eating Cheeze-Its when I’m feeling lazy (because have you tasted them? Holy crunchy, salty goodness), this remains one of the most unique and entertaining trips I’ve taken. Plus, the guides truly were wonderful and enthusiastic about the subject matter. If you find yourself in the area, pop up to Northern Ireland and take a look around. You’ll never forget it. *Since I was there working and providing assistance to Steve this visit was not paid for by me, however, I wrote this only because I wanted to, not because I was expected to, asked to, or compensated to do so. I shared the experience with you because I enjoyed it and thought you guys would, too.  Oh wow, stunning photos! I do love the GOT books, I binge-read them for 5 full days when I was the sickest I have ever been in Arequipa Peru. But those rock formations – that it a bigger draw to me than the filming locations, I cannot believe that is natural, so amazing! I do love binge-reading a book series when I have a lot of forced down time like that! The rock formations were amazing and I was really looking forward to seeing them. Murlough Bay was pretty stunning too, though! Nicest people I’ve ever met were the Irish.Great country. Could easily do a month there.Definitely have to go to Northern Ireland after reading this post. I could easily do a month there too. I would love to travel the entire coastline. Oh my gosh! I just got back from Ireland/NI! We hit up a few of those spots but were on time constraints and I knew my parents couldn’t handle me doing an hour photo session [which I would’ve totally have done]. So basically I now have to go back and hit up all of the same places with a few new ones I knew about but didnt get to. Such a gorgeous gorgeous place that looks like its from a movie! guess it wouldnt hurt either to watch Game of Thrones 😮 We did quite a few hour+ filming and photo stops. I don’t think we spent under that amount of time in any of these spots so I can see how you’d need to go back in order to be able to do that 🙂 Sometimes it’s nice traveling with people who are also photo and video-obsessed so I don’t feel as annoying taking so long to get photos! Dress up is a pretty big selling point for me when traveling or going to festivals. I love it and always have! Agreed you couldn’t ask for more amazingly beautiful places to don a cape and sword than these. Hi!! So happy to find your blog 🙂I went to Northen Ireland in october and this one of my favourite place in the world!!Giant’s Causeway and Dark Hedges were stunning (also if i didn’t see Games of Thrones yet – ooops!) I’m glad you found it too! I really loved NI too. So beautiful. i am not a fan of the show!!! but the places that they film are gorgeous and now they are on my list of best places to go Even given my lack of show knowledge and general interest I still LOVED checking out the locations and especially dressing up in character. Dress up = awesomeness. I’m a HUGE Game of Thrones fans, so this looks amazing! I’ve been to Northern Ireland before, but only very briefly to visit Belfast and Giants Causeway. I SO want to see the Dark Hedges some day. That road is too pretty. I think I saw your Giant’s Causeway photo before and it’s a big reason why when that was on the itinerary I was like, “Yes yes yes! That’s one spot I know and have long wanted to see!” This is so cool ! Which episode  ?I love rocks too ~ like a lot =)Could share some budget guide in Ireland or europe cheaper place to travel  ? Haha I didn’t actually get into the show, I just got to go to the same places and dress in the costumes 🙂Ireland isn’t a budget destination but Eastern Europe (which I haven’t been to yet) gets rave reviews from other travelers and it’s pretty cheap as well. Northern Ireland is far more beautiful than I could have ever imagined … thanks for the tour via Game of Thrones shooting sites! Do you possible have a map in order or these locations?  Planning a trip late summer!  Photographs are simply amazing! I don’t but you can plot them on Google maps. I posted them in the order that we drove to them 🙂 I’ve never seen a single episode of Game of Thrones… But I am very likely headed to Ireland this fall so I’m digging through your Ireland posts for a little inspiration! I think for Valentines Day I’m going to fix my guy a big feast since I’m off and he’ll be at work all day, and I was thinking of purchasing an Ireland map so that we can spend the evening fantasizing about our trip. What are some of your favorite spots that we should maybe look into? He’s going to spend the first week and half walking across Ireland (I forget the name of his route…) and I’ll meet him there after spending some time somewhere else in Europe with my best friend. So he’ll have already done a good bit of walking but I still think we’d like to do some hiking and extensive exploring. I’d really love to see the Giant’s Causeway you mentioned here! But anything else you think should top the list to look into? Great Article & Images We did the tour from Belfast with the same Company that transport the Cast & Crew of the show while filming here in Ireland, The tour was amazing they had all the props for getting into theme on the Coach, The tour guide was also a extra on the show and the driver drove the Cast around, We also got to see the Giants Causeway & Carrick-a-rede.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/western-ireland-attractions/,Amazingly Beautiful Western Ireland,Ireland,"Ireland truly was a special place for me, but for some reason I hadn’t written much about it.  I was blown away by the friendly locals and stunning countryside, but had trouble finding the words to describe the beauty of it. That was, until I reviewed my photos and realized that I simply couldn’t fail to pass along information on the amazing west coast attractions. I was very surprised to learn that this is actually the least fertile part of Ireland, given I come from the desert and this looked pretty darn green and lush to me, not to mention it boasts some amazingly gorgeous beaches that you can get almost completely to yourself (check that link for another idea of a great way to spend a day in this area). The area was hit very hard by the potato blight as well as emigration, resulting in a relatively small population as compared to the past, which these days makes for a great array of off the beaten path adventures: The Great Western Greenway Hop on a bicycle and cycle the Great Western Greenway, aptly named as the view along the entire ride is rewarding as is the exercise kick.  The entire greenway stretches for 42 km along the western Irish coast from Westport to Achill. Check out this map for a better idea of where to bike and where to eat some amazing Irish cuisine along the way. Cliffs of Moher Though arguably firmly on the tourist trail, the Cliffs of Moher are wildly popular for a reason. Easily accessed as a day trip from both Dublin and Galway (though it’s a mighty long bus ride from the former), these cliffs are well worth taking a look at.  If you’re lucky, you’ll get them on a day as clear as I did: Cnoc Suain in Spiddal Stop at the Cnoc Suain a few miles outside of Galway – a restored 17th century Connemara hill-village set on 200 acres of bog land. The family that lives there has committed their lives to educating visitors more about Irish culture, the ties of western Ireland to the bogs and the importance of peet as fuel, as well as some traditional Irish music and dancing. Visitors can even stay here overnight in one of the cottages, which in hindsight I absolutely would have done.  It’s incredibly peaceful and warmly welcoming at the same time. Though I certainly can’t consider myself Irish, given my family has been in the United States since the Mayflower, I couldn’t help but feel somewhat connected to this part of the world, and its history.  Part of my heritage is Irish (I believe my surname is as well), which had me wondering about my forefathers who walked these very same fields. I wonder how they felt about the bogs, how hard it was to leave this beautiful place for the bustle and confusion of the United States, and if they ever missed it. I feel lucky to have seen it for myself. Have you been to Western Ireland or are you planning to go? *In the spirit of full disclosure, Failte Ireland was my host on the west coast and Paddywagon brought me to the Cliffs of Moher.  Opinions are, as always, my own.  I LOVED Ireland and was lucky enough to visit a few years back. We drove from Dublin, west to Galway, then south to Cork and then looped back up to Dublin. I found the people warm, the scenery just stunning and pretty must everything about the country inviting. Driving on the left made me a little crazy (no shoulders on the narrow roads and the Irish love to whip around the little curves) but I’d go back in a heartbeat! Thanks for bringing back memories from my trip! You said it well Diane! The locals really make Ireland awesome. Oh man, I would LOVE to go to Ireland. My great-great-grandparents were from there and I’ve always wanted to see it. Your photos make me think it might actually look the way I picture it in my mind 🙂 I think it probably does.  Western Ireland isn’t even the “green” part! so pretty (except for the grey sky) I didn’t mind the grey sky 🙂 Hey Kristin!Love your photos of the west of Ireland. I’ve spent plenty of time there, but always long to go back. You seem to have gotten plenty of fine weather for your photos. Lucky you!Liam I definitely liked the weather! Nice and misty but not torrential downpours. Felt like we got some of that Irish luck 🙂 Great pics of some of the iconic locations on the west coast, but and there is a but ! The best way to experience the west coast is not on a day trip from dublin (unless you have no other option) where you only get to interact with the other people on the bus.One of the best experiences when in Ireland is staying in some small town or village and wandering in to the local pub, having a chat with some of the locals over a pint and maybe listening to some real traditional Irish music, it is during these often very humerous conversations that you will begin to understand the Irish psyche and also one of these locals may direct you to a hidden gem with a great story that other visitors will never know about.  I should have been clearer – I did the trip to Cliffs of Moher on a day trip from Dublin, but agree it was too rushed. Staying in Galway or the smaller towns is a great call! It looks really great there. The fotos are good and I bet you had trouble wondering which ones to post. Love it. Western Ireland is one of my bucket list places to visit. How good is the local transport there (if there is any apart from tours etc)? Looks like I could bivvy up okay – like it’s so sparsely populated and there are abandoned places that’d do for an overnite etc. I think you could probably find a bus. That’d be nice. Local info oughta point to something. Thanks. Had to take a minute to comment on your AMAZING photos! I know that this post is a bit dated, but I wanted to mention that if you’re a movie buff at all… The rock peeking out from the ocean at the Cliffs of Moher is actually featured in the Harry Potter films.. In the sixth film, Harry and Dumbledore go looking for one of Voldemort’s Horcruxes, and end up on that exact rock! As well, the cliffs themselves are the “Cliffs of Insanity” of the always-classic The Princess Bride!  Truly gorgeous place to visit, though! I don’t know if you witness this as well, but there’s a big sign there at the end of the tourist are indicating that you shouldn’t go past it. I have a picture of that sign with about 50 people on the other (“forbidden”) side! I didn’t know that! I’m a big fan of HP and Princess Bride! Good to know. I realize I’m here a bit late from posting but I’m cruising all your Ireland posts to get some ideas for the fall! I’ll be there for ten days. Your pictures are beautiful and are getting me so excited! Have the best time! it’s gorgeous there.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/off-the-beaten-track-in-ireland/,Only You and the Irish Coast,Ireland," There are so many places in this world, sometimes it seems silly to go back when there is so much left unexplored. Then again, it’s silly not to go back when you love a place so much that you know you need to explore more of it, isn’t it? That’s what Ireland is – a place worth going back to over and over. It’s the greenery of the rolling hills, the sea cliffs that, on a clear day, provide views of the other side or even other islands. It’s the hospitality and the humor that keep me coming back. …and the oysters too. MAN I love oysters. This time it was all about exploring a new part of the Wild Atlantic Way, a road that wraps around the island and is the longest coastal drive in the world. While it’s always been there, it’s only lately that it’s had this name and become popular, and the little towns along the way are still quaint and small, and some of the roads still small and winding. From Galway to Donegal, here’s the best of the Wild Atlantic Way (IMHO): The Wild Atlantic Way is famous in part for the food. Chefs are taking Irish cuisine to a whole new level, showcasing local seafood, lamb, and beef. The dinner at Ard Bia, a restaurant just under the Spanish Arch, was the perfect introduction to this food culture. Trust me on this one: The lamb croquettes and steak are heaven. Plus, the bartender liked Steve and my corny jokes. Nobody likes Steve’s jokes, so this was pretty cool. (juuuust kidding, Steve). Stay: The House Hotel – the location is great and it’s all pretty in pink. From Galway to Clifden you can take your time and drive along the coast or do a straight shot. The coast has some great stops so despite the fact that it is quite narrow in places and with lots of turns, it’s worth driving along it and stopping from time to time. The first stop for us was just north of Galway at a beach called the Silver Strand. There were kite surfers and even a swimmer in the water! I couldn’t believe my eyes. The receptionist at the House Hotel had also suggested that we stop at Two Dogs Bay on the way up, which was a stellar beach as well, with white sand and light blue water over black rocks. I suggest taking your time on this drive, watching out for the Wild Atlantic Way signs and pulling off whenever something looks like it could have potential. Clifden was the stopping point for the day where we took a walk through the bogs and through history with a local guide who told us about the landing spot of the first trans-continental flight, as well as one of the first and largest radio receivers in history. It’s always nice having a local tell you about his home, isn’t it? Stay: Clifden is a good stopping point for the day since the drive up from Galway, especially with stops, can be pretty long. I stayed at the Quay House and it’s one of the quirkiest and funkiest places I’ve been. Each room has a theme, including the Napoleon room or mine, the blue room: Plus, they had oysters on the menu, for breakfast! You had me at oysters. Upon leaving Clifden, the Sky Road, which only takes about 20 minutes to drive, offers some gorgeous views. Or at least I’m sure they would normally be pretty gorgeous, but it was a misty and cloudy day for us. I still enjoyed the drive anyway, and that’s Ireland, after all. Next you’ll come to Kylemore Abbey, which was a highlight for me. I’d seen a photo of this famous Abbey when I was younger and painted it for my grandmother, who had also traveled through Ireland (and much of Europe and the rest of the world), so it had sentimental value as well. That’s when I started to really appreciate the mist: Entrance to the Abbey is €14, which includes the gardens, the church, and the walkway pictured above. You can still get the iconic photo of the Abbey from the bridge, without the entrance, if that’s all you’re after. There’s also a short but steep hike to a statue of Christ just above the Abbey if you feel like getting your sweat on. From there we made our way to Killary and took a fjord cruise, amazed that during low season, we had the boat to ourselves! There were so many little streams coming down each of the seaside cliffs, it looked like mini waterfalls on the changing orange grasses, dotted with sheep. On a lucky day you can see dolphins as well. Stay: From there you can head inland a bit to Delphi Resort and Spa, which is situated in a gorgeous little valley near the tallest mountain in the area (at just over 800 meters). It’s family friendly and their seaweed bath had my skin feeling like it had reverse-aged about 20 years, it was so soft!  The next morning you can either take the coastal route or the route through the mountains, which is what we did, and found a few perfect little photo stops along the way: For lunch I suggest you make your way to Westport which is building a name for itself as a foodie spot. What I loved about it is the nature of the locals there, who emphasize working together to achieve success with tourism, their main industry. When Steve and I took the food tour there, sampling soft local baked goods, delicious craft beers, mussels, crisp apples, and super flavorful homemade pesto and hummus, locals kept recognizing our guide and joining us. By the end there were 6 of us altogether, which, to me, so perfectly illustrates what I love about Ireland – the friendliness and the feeling that everyone is practically family. You can contact Redmond for a tour here. For the night, we stayed at an inn connected to a pub in a tiny town south of Sligo called Templeboy. This is the type of place where you can really feel Irish friendliness and hospitality. Within a few minutes of walking in there was a group playing the fiddle (and very well I might add), and a group of guys who invited Steve and I to join them for two pints of Guinness. Honestly, where else do you walk into a pub and you’re everyone’s new best friend? It happens all the time in Ireland! Stay: Templeboy Beach Bar, particularly room 9 which has a nice view of the beach and cliffs of Sligo. When passing through Sligo, Strandhill is a popular stop to watch the surfers. Steve and I were on a mission to make it to Slieve League and then ownard to Derry for Halloween the same day, so we bypassed it but if you have the time, definitely stop by. Mullaghmore is also an absolute must. Steve and I actually drove up there for sunset and then back down to Templeboy for the night, which doesn’t make any sense logistically, but we wanted to make the most of the gorgeous sunset unfolding given that we’re photographers and that kind of thing is how we get our kicks. It would be stunning at any time of day, though. Then it was onwards to Slieve League, which is a must-see. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Nov 1, 2016 at 10:20am PDT  If you saw and loved the Cliffs of Moher, and especially if you didn’t Slieve League is equally as impressive: They’re Europe’s tallest sea cliffs, and at least at the end of October, were free to view. That night we made our way to Derry, Ireland’s only walled city, for the Halloween festival:  If you have the time, it’s so worth road tripping through Northern Ireland as well, with towering basalt columns at the Giant’s Causeway, gorgeous beaches, and Game of Thrones filming locations which, even for someone who isn’t a fan of the show (I don’t watch TV or movies because I have no attention span), were a delight. Those are a few of the best (of many, of course) great stops between Galway and Donegal in one of the friendliest and greenest countries in the world. Sit back and enjoy the twists and turns and narrow roads, driving on the left and self-fiving yourself for getting better and better at it with each passing day. A road trip down the Wild Atlantic Way is an adventure you’ll never forget. *This post is brought to you in partnership with Tourism Ireland who helped me experience yet another part of the Wild Atlantic Way. Opinions of Ireland, a country I’ve happily returned to 5 times and expect to visit many more to come, are my own. Loved this post! Personally my favourite part of the WAW is from Galway to Kerry but the views in Donegal are pretty insane! I haven’t gotten to explore it as much as you have but your pictures make a pretty convincing argument for me to plan a trip there! Didn’t make it to Kerry but adding it to the list now! Thanks for another great post, and for taking me into the northern part of the Wild Atlantic Way! On my around the world journey I was lucky enough to cover the south-western part and it was amazing , but time ran out & I missed the north – looks like it’s worth a trip back…http://www.travelynntales.com//?s=Ireland+&x=0&y=0 I did the same a few years ago. It’s good in bits and pieces too! Im from Ireland and its so nice to see people enjoying our countryside!  We take it all for granted but when someone else shows us their photos or opinions of the country, it reminds you just how beautiful Ireland is.  I only recently did the Wild Atlantic Way myself and loved every second of it!   The Burren, Kerry and West Cork are all instagram ready too…absolutely gorgeous! I love reading other people’s opinions of where I’m from too! It’s nice to see things from a visitor’s point of view. Glad you like the photos! Off in a few weeks back out to the WAW and headed up to stay with friends in Donegal for a month or so cannot wait. I think Donegal is truly my favourite area of Ireland although a housesit for 7 weeks in Tipperary almost had me convinced to move there…lol… I love the wild rawness of Donegal and the lack of tourist and people most of all it allows me to breathe and that is so wonderful That part of Ireland is really nice for heading off the beaten path a bit and being around locals, for sure! Would you mind suggesting a itinerary for Ireland like you did for Iceland? I follow your guide for Iceland and loved it! Thanks! This is my best one for this part of the coast, and you can find my northern ireland one linked in there as well, however I haven’t traveled the whole country so it’s hard for me to comment on the rest of it! this has made me so excited as we are doing the same for my 50th in october, wonderful and helphul, thanksjo from manchester Have fun! We’re travelling to Ireland for the first time this coming June. We only have 10 nights, and are starting and ending in Dublin. We need to visit Northern Ireland (Bangor), since that’s where my family was from, and originally the reason we are going. Now that I’ve been studying Ireland, I realize how much more of it I want/need to see. What a beautiful Island. We’re just trying to figure out a route for our 10 night stay. Everywhere looks like heaven to me, and I know that 10 nights is not nearly enough. I can say that hopefully I’ll be back, without even having gone yet. I did this route in about a week, in case that helps! You can drive back down to Dublin via a more major highway instead of the WAW and get it done in a few hours. I was planning on going to Derry for halloween this year and I am so happy I saw this post beforehand. I would love to do this road trip there! Do you think this drive would be doable for a single female? It sounds like everyone you met was very friendly so that gives me hope! Yeah I’d definitely do it solo! Kristen, Love Your Photos!Came across your blog while researching for our family trip to Ireland in 3 weeks.  I spent a couple of years traveling solo across Asia and Nepal early 2000s, but now traveling with hubby and 2 kids….sodoing a bit more planning this time 😉We have about 10 days for travel before heading to a wedding in Connemara.  So many amazing choices and so little time!  Hubby is a lover of nature and rocks, not a fan of lots of people or tourist sites.  I’m thinking of forgoing the Ring of Kerry and Cliffs of Moher to take the road less traveled and follow your route N of Galway to Derry!  Thanks for posting all this info and  the photos 🙂 You should have more solitude on this route. Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/when-to-travel-to-iceland/,The Best Time to Visit Iceland: A Breakdown of Each Season’s Pros & Cons,Iceland,"Iceland is magical to visit. Where else can you see countless waterfalls, the midnight sun or the northern lights, and landscape that looks otherworldly?  When planning a trip to Iceland, naturally one of the first considerations is which season to pick. There are pros and cons to each, and having gone in the peak of summer in July and in October, right on the cusp of fall and winter, I have some thoughts on when to travel to Iceland and why:  Weather: Iceland’s winter weather is, of course, cold; however, it is not nearly as frigid as you’d expect – thank you Gulf Stream! The temperature typically hovers between 20 and 30 degrees Fahrenheit, so while you should prepare for cold, wind, and snow, know that the winter weather is on the mild side – for the Arctic.  Keep in mind that Iceland only sees 3 to 5 hours of daylight in the winter, however this is perfect if you want to catch the northern lights! Average precipitation: The winter season sees an average of around 15 inches of precipitation (liquid equivalent, melting down any sleet and snow), about 3 inches per month. While it does precipitate in Iceland year-round, autumn and winter tend to see more precipitation than other times of year.*  Pricing: Flights and accommodations tend to be much cheaper in the winter months than in the summer months. In fact, some prices even drop to half of what they would normally be in peak season.  Booking ease: Booking a place to stay and reserving spots on tours and excursions is significantly easier in the winter than in the busier months. Not only will you have no problem finding availability, you will pay a much cheaper price than you would at other times of year.  Road conditions: Some routes will be closed this time of year, like Iceland’s highlands. Major attractions like the Golden Circle, however, should still be mostly accessible. Be aware of icy roads and high winds, and remember that daylight hours are few. Oh, and watch out for reindeer!  Major attractions availability: Few of Iceland’s major attractions close for the winter. In fact, many of them are actually more enjoyable in the winter! For example, natural hot springs might be the most fun in the colder months, and popular natural features are all the more stunning when not overcrowded with tourists and frosted with snow. Also, the island’s ice caves can only be visited from November to March. You even have the highest chances of seeing the northern lights in the winter due to the sky being its darkest. Weather: The spring months bring somewhat warmer temperatures, but many days still see rain or snow and usually range from 30 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Springs sees significantly more daylight than winter. Average precipitation: The spring season experiences about 4 inches of precipitation (liquid equivalent), an average of 2 inches per month (a little more in April, a little less in May).* Pricing: Tourism is still sparse during the spring, as many travelers want to visit Iceland in the summer when the sun is out late at night. As a result, a springtime trip is significantly cheaper than a summertime one.  Booking ease: Crowds do not begin to collect until the end of May (the start of summer tourism), so finding accommodations is easy in the spring, especially in April. If you book well in advance and choose dates in early or even mid-May, you’ll be able to enjoy a combination of warmer weather, affordability, few crowds, and lots of daylight!  Major attractions availability: Spring offers a wide variety of attractions and activities; however, it is important to note that a few winter attractions might not be available for the whole of spring. For example, the ice caves close at the end of March, and after mid-April, brighter night skies make the northern lights harder and then impossible to see. Still, this is a great time to camp along the Ring Road with fewer people around and better weather than in the winter months, especially if you rent a camper van with a space heater.  Road conditions: Driving in Iceland is certainly safer in the spring, and many roads are more accessible as the temperatures warm up. However, routes in the Central Highlands remain closed, and roads could still be dangerous if the snow and ice persist further into the spring months.  Weather: Summer in Iceland means that the sun is out all the time, even late at night. Temperatures are at their warmest, averaging from 45 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, but not uncommon to experience days well into the 70’s (all time record of 87 degrees F). Cold, windy days are still a possibility, though. Average rainfall: The summer season sees about 6.5 inches of rainfall, with roughly 2 inches each month through June, July, and August.  Pricing: Prices will be at their highest in the summer, as this is peak tourism season in Iceland. Everything from hotel rooms to rental cars to guided tours will significantly jump in price.  Booking ease: Booking for this season isn’t easy. Accommodations and activities are expensive and fill up quickly. The key is to plan your trip well in advance for maximum availability.  Road conditions: Roads are their best in the summer, when the ice has melted off and closed routes have opened back up. While there will be more cars on the roads than in other seasons, summer is the best time to drive around Iceland.  Major attractions availability: The only downside to Iceland’s list of attractions in the summer is that both the northern lights and the ice caves are not one of them. With the sun out nearly 24 hours a day, the sky does not get dark enough for the lights to be visible, and warmer temperatures prevent travelers from touring the ice caves. That said, it’s the only time that’s feasible to hike the Laugavegur and Fimmvorduhals trails, given their very short hiking season of July and August. This is an experience worth having! Better weather and plenty of daylight ensure that you can try plenty of the countless other things Iceland has to offer.  The weather starts to cool off in the fall, with temperatures, on average, hovering around 50 degrees Fahrenheit in September and lowering towards 30 degrees at night through October. Daylight hours narrow significantly as winter approaches, but September still does see a good amount of sunshine. By October, you’ll experience almost an equal amount of light and dark, making this an ideal time to travel the Ring Road (here’s an itinerary) in search of the northern lights. Personally, the fall is my favorite time in Iceland for the changing colors, smaller crowds, and lights.  Average precipitation: Autumn receives around 6 inches of precipitation (liquid equivalent) in all, ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 inches per month. Pricing: Fall marks the beginning of “off-season,” so most prices will drop a great deal the first week of September. In fact, some off-season prices can drop to less than half of what they would be during peak season. This goes for everything from tours and excursions to flights and accommodations.  Booking ease: As the “midnight sun” begins to disappear, so too will the crowds. It is much easier to book flights, places to stay, and activities in the fall, and the later in the year you visit, the fewer tourists there will be.  Road conditions: Some areas will begin to become inaccessible as the weather changes. However, September is still fairly warm, so roads won’t start closing until ice and snow become a problem.  Major attractions availability: Fall might just be the best season for Iceland’s attractions. The northern lights reappear in September, and Iceland holds a film festival in late September. Most of the activities available in summer are still available in the fall, plus the ice caves open back up in mid-October.  What we can take away from this is, there’s no bad time to visit Iceland. Thanks to the milder temperatures than what the rest of the Arctic tends to experience, it’s cold but not unpleasant throughout most of the year. And unlike the rest of the Arctic, Iceland doesn’t get mosquitoes in the summertime, either! So if you want the perfect combination of beauty and comfort, Iceland is ideal. And if you ask me, it doesn’t get any better than visiting in the autumn months, unless you want to hike, then you’ll just have to go back again like I did!  *All temperature/precipitation data is based on statistics for Reykjavik, Iceland    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-fimmvorduhals-hike/,An Independent Guide to Iceland’s Fimmvörðuháls Hike,Iceland,"Iceland’s Fimmvörðuháls hike is a two day adventure in the southern part of the island, either beginning in Skógar and ending in Þórsmörk, or vice versa. For the more adventurous, like my BMTM Adventures group and me, it’s the perfect addendum to the four-day Laugavegur trail beginning in the highlands. Whether you’re doing this as an add-on, or only have time for the Fimmvörðuháls trail, you’re in for a beautiful adventure with shades of green that I previously thought couldn’t exist outside of cartoons, plentiful waterfalls that look like they’re from the Shire, and sweeping glacier views, provided that you have clear weather. This post will help you do the hike independently, since most of what I found online were tour operators selling tours without any meaty info. So without further ado, here’s everything you need to know about the Fimmvörðuháls hike: This point-to-point hike can be done in either direction. Obviously, if you’re adding this on from the Laugavegur hike, you’ll be beginning in Þórsmörk (pronounced ‘Thorsmork’) and finishing in Skógar. The benefit of beginning in Þórsmörk is that you will do most of the steep part of the trail uphill. I much prefer this to a steep downhill, though I may be in the minority there. This also means that you get a chance to see where the famous waterfall originates, at the glaciers, and follow it all the way down to Skógafoss, which felt like the perfect culmination of six days on the trail for us. I also appreciate that the downhill is so gradual. It is about 1000 meters, after all. The drive back from Skógar to Reykjavik, stopping at some of the beautiful sites along the way, was a perfect finale as well. Conversely, if you choose to do it in the other direction, your uphill will be more gradual as you make your way to the pass, watching as the landscape goes from green to a chocolate covered volcanic terrain. It’s pretty dramatic and beautiful! You can also hike all 26 km in one day, which some people do. Since you have so much daylight, it’s not out of the realm of possibilities. Be sure to check the bus schedules (there are about 5 companies) to make sure that you can make it, and be prepared to have to turn back if the weather gets bad. It can happen. Some of the trail is steep and narrow, making parts of it quite perilous if the weather isn’t good (more on that later). Make sure you’re checking in with the wardens to get a read on the weather. Online resources are rarely accurate. I liked breaking it up into two days, being able to take our time a bit more, stopping for photos, which happened constantly. First, decide how many days you want to give this trail. Will you stay in the hut in Þórsmörk the night before you begin, or the night that you finish if you go the other way? Just in case the weather is bad, it might be nice to have options and extra food. Here’s what I brought: Food: I brought along just-add-water camp meals. After many backpacking trails, and being a human guinea pig, I figured out the best tasting ones. I have a ranking here to help you. It’s best to buy these at home and bring them into Iceland with you. Even though the hut at the pass did have just-add-water meals for sale (for like $30), I wouldn’t count on them having provisions. It’s also wise to pick up snack, breakfast and lunch items at the grocery stores in Reykjavik before you head out. You’ll find the best selections there. Hiking: You need to have waterproof clothing. I’m not a fan of rain pants, so I wear Lululemon leggings that dry super fast. However I do advocate a rain jacket and if you’ll use a rain cover, make sure it’s one that straps around the middle and around the waist so that it stays on in the potentially heavy wind. I love this one. Waterproof gloves are also a must. Even if you’re not a fan of hiking poles, it’s important to have them on this trail. Parts of it are very steep and slippery, and you may encounter heavy winds like we did. Connectivity: Although the huts don’t have WiFi, I was shocked to find that I had cell service for most of the hike! I was able to surf on 3G, for better or worse, for most of the hike with a Siminn SIM card that I bought at the convenience store at the arrivals hall of the airport. Just keep in mind there is nowhere to charge electronics on the trail, so bring an external battery pack if you plan to use signal or charge camera batteries. Sleeping: First, decide if you’re camping or staying in the hut. It’s important to note that the hut where you will overnight, should you choose to do this in two days, does not have running water. Collect as much water as you can from the snowmelt if you start in Þórsmörk or if you start in Skógar. There’s a river on the right hand part of the trail when the water is easier to access. If you’re looking for it you won’t miss it. It’s about 30 minutes from the hut. You also must book this ahead of time, which you can do here. You will also need your own sleeping bag. The huts are pretty warm, so you don’t need something that will keep you warm below freezing. Finally, bring an eye mask and earplugs. You could be sharing the room with snorers and since the sun never truly sets, it can get bright. Both are very helpful to shuteye and were worth their weight in gold to me. If you’re backpacking it, be sure to check out my backpacking packing list which has all of the gear that I use. It’s also helpful if you’re staying in the huts, just eliminate the tent and sleeping mat. Since I did this hike beginning in Þórsmörk , that’s the direction I’ll describe the hike in, but you can easily read this and then reverse it: Though we hiked into Þórsmörk from the Laugavegur trail, it’s possible to take a bus in as well. The hut in  Þórsmörk is nice to stay in, has a kitchen, and allowed us a night of rest before making our way up. Since the wardens told us that heavy winds would be coming in the afternoon, we began our hike at 5 AM as the sun was cresting the horizon. After about a 600 m gain, we came to our first narrow part of the trail. There are ropes to help stabilize you for part of it, and as long as it’s not incredibly foggy or very windy, this is doable, but will be pretty uncomfortable if you have a fear of heights. We were lucky. It was perfectly clear and beautiful as we made our way past a green canyon and up, up, up roughly 200 meters more to a plateau with stunning views of the glaciers. It’s one of the most impressive views I’ve ever seen on a hike, and that’s saying a lot! This is a perfect resting spot before another narrow part of the trail, again with chains to hold onto. Keep in mind that the signs posted on this trail don’t always give an accurate read of how far you’ve come or how far you have to go. I believe this is because the area of Þórsmörk is somewhat large and the huts are each a couple of km away from each other. So don’t depend too much on them to figure out how far you’ve gone or have to go yet. It can get disheartening. From there it’s quite a steep final 200 m gain to the area of the last big volcanic explosion on Iceland. The landscape changes from green to volcanic rock and sand. You’ll see plenty of snow along the trail as well. Finally, you’ll hike a few more kilometers along the volcanic landscape before an incredibly sharp descent, at least when I went, on ice, followed by another sharp ascent before arriving at the Baldvinsskáli hut. Make sure you’re heading to the small white Baldvinsskáli hut with the sloped roof rather than the red hut to the right, which is for rangers only. Follow the signs. Though this hut does not have running water, there is a small jug that they truck in from Skógar. The warden had to be pretty sparing on how much water she gave out when I was there, as their truck was having issues, so don’t count on being able to get as much water as you want at the hut. For hikers coming through, she was selling a maximum of 1 L for 500 ISK. Since we knew that there would not be much water at the hut for the night, we collected and purified the snowmelt as we went. The hut has two options for sleeping – one upstairs with about 12 mattresses, and downstairs where the rest of the people sleep. I liked the cozy atmosphere and enjoyed meeting all of the different people who stayed at the hut for the night. Each person has their own mattress on the floor but you’ll need to bring your own sleeping bag. It felt pretty clean to me and it was nice and warm, too. The winds that we had been warned about the day before never really came, instead waiting until about 7 AM the next morning when I looked out the window and saw thick fog and felt the howling wind against the window. I never thought those things could go together before! After a quick breakfast, finally finishing up all but the last of our rations from our epic hike, we made our way out into about 35 mph wind just as the fog cleared. This is another reason why I really like hiking poles. They help a lot with balance in conditions like these. I felt like a marionette for the first few kilometers but as we descended the wind got a bit lighter. There are two main ways to get down to Skógafoss – a road that the big trucks use to bring provisions up to the hut, and a path past all of the waterfalls, the Fimmvörðuháls trail. You’ll follow the road at first, but after a couple of kilometers you will notice the blue stakes start to veer off to the right. You’ll know pretty quickly if you miss it because there should be a bridge to cross the river (whereas the road would require a river crossing) and a sign as well. From there you’ll get back down into the greenery, and you’ll start seeing your first waterfalls. There must be at least 20 on the way of varying heights and widths. They’re all beautiful and if you’re like us, you’ll be stopping pretty frequently on the way to take pictures and enjoy the views. The trail just gets more and more lush as you make your way down. It’s worth mentioning here that this part of the trail is often very foggy. We had our route mapped out on our phones using maps.me, an offline GPS app, which I highly recommend you download before you leave Wi-Fi. The trail can have sharp drop-offs, so always be looking for where the posts are to mark the trail. As you continue downward, you’ll keep passing more magical canyons and waterfalls as you start to see more and more people joining the trail from Skógar. This is always a bittersweet moment for me, because it means the end of a long hike but also re-joining civilization. I look forward to the hot shower while simultaneously wishing I could stay out in the wilderness for a bit longer. However this day is gradual, and enjoyable, and finishes with the crown jewel waterfall: Skógafoss. If you have the time, I recommend staying in the town of Skógar (Hotel Skógar has nice rooms, a hot tub, and a great restaurant) for the night so that you can go back to the waterfall around sunset when there aren’t very many people around. That’s how we got photos without anybody in them! The next day, take your time and make some stops on the way back to Reykjavik if you can. Since there were so many of us, we got our own van and driver. But I’m guessing that there are tours you can look into as well to see the waterfalls and black sand beaches of Vík on your way back. I can understand why this is Iceland’s most popular hike. Where else on earth can you see this many waterfalls all in one day? Moreover, each of them is spectacular and unique. It’s hard to think of many places on earth where you get that, and sweeping glacier views surrounded by impossibly green canyons. This hike is just one beautiful layer after another and if you get lucky with the weather, you can see it all. Happy trails, and if you do this hike, I hope you’ll come back and let me know how you enjoyed it! And if you can be swayed, I absolutely recommend doing the Laugavegur trail from Landmannalaugar as well. You can read more about that here.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/laugavegur-trail-iceland/,How to Hike the Laugavegur Trail in Iceland Independently,Iceland,"The Laugavegur Trail in Iceland is one of the most unique and visually stimulating trails in the world. Not only do you have constantly shifting landscapes, from the rainbow-striped mounds of the highlands in Landmannalaugar to the psychedelic greens of Þórsmörk, but ever-changing conditions as well. No wonder National Geographic ranked this trail in their top 20 in the world. There’s nothing out there that can equal it. With the uniqueness of the trail comes a unique set of requirements for enjoying and thriving on this journey. Before I set out on it myself, most of what I could find were posts advertising guided hikes without any real information on what to expect each day and how to prepare. That changes now. After guiding a hike on the trail myself, I found out everything you need to know about hiking the Laugavegur Trail in Iceland independently: Based on the other multi-day hikes I’ve done around the world, I’d rank this as a solid moderate. The gains and losses aren’t too bad nor dramatic, though there are some steep parts. The biggest issue is weather, which can change at a moment’s notice. You just need to be prepared for that, which I’ll get into, and you’ll be just fine. That is the question. Should you begin in Landmannalaugar (say that 10 times fast) or Þórsmörk (pronounced “Thorsmork”)? And perhaps more importantly, should you add on two more days at the end, or beginning, to Skógar? If you can be swayed, I advocate making this a six day rather than a four day trek and going all the way to Skógar on the Fimmvorduhals trail (more on that later), beginning in Landmannalaugar. This makes the first few days, when you have the most weight, a bit easier because instead of having a big uphill on days one and two in the reverse, you have a more gradual uphill on day one. That said, there’s no wrong way. The next big question is, will you backpack or will you stay in the huts? Given the huts cost about US$90 per night, it’s quite expensive for what you get, which is just a shared bunk, and sometimes even a shared mattress, in a room with lots of other people. That said, if I had it to do over again I would still stay in the huts because there’s a very good chance that your tent will never be dry on this trail. The winds can get crazy strong and it’s highly likely that at some point in the day, you will encounter rain. Most of the time, by leaving early in the morning, we were able to avoid the bad weather. But if you’re in a tent there is no escape. You also lighten your load by not having to carry cooking equipment, a tent, and a sleeping mat. The choice is yours! If you do decide to stay in a hut, book them as far ahead of time as possible. There are only two months out of each year that are reasonable to hike the trail, in July and August, so they book up quite far in advance. Sometimes you can get lucky and get a last-minute booking, but that might mean you’d have to carry your tent around just in case, which nullifies the point for me. Food: I brought along plenty of just-add-water camp meals. After many backpacking trails, and being a human guinea pig, I figured out the best tasting ones. I have a ranking here to help you. It’s best to buy these at home and bring them into Iceland with you. Even though the huts have kitchens, this makes cooking so much easier and only requires that you boil water to make dinners. Additionally, pick up snacks and breakfast and lunch items at the grocery stores in Reykjavik before you head out. Some of the huts will have snacks and food, but don’t count on it. Hiking: You need to have waterproof clothing. I’m not a fan of rain pants, so I wear lululemon leggings that dry super fast. However I do advocate a rain jacket and if you’ll use a rain cover, make sure it’s one that straps around the middle and around the waist so that it stays on in the potentially heavy wind. I love this one. Waterproof gloves are also a must. Even if you’re not a fan of hiking poles, it’s important to have them on this trail. Parts of it are very steep and slippery, plus they’re useful for the river crossings. Connectivity: Although the huts don’t have WiFi, I was shocked to find that I had cell service for most of the hike! I was able to surf on 3G, for better or worse, for most of the hike with a Siminn SIM card that I bought at the convenience store at the arrivals hall of the airport. Just keep in mind there is nowhere to charge electronics on the trail, so bring an external battery pack if you plan to use signal or charge camera batteries. Sleeping: You will also need your own sleeping bag. The huts are pretty warm, so you don’t need something that will keep you warm below freezing. Bring a towel as well, as some of the huts have showers for 500 ISK (about $4), and they take credit cards. Finally, bring an eye mask and earplugs. You could be sharing the room with snorers and since the sun never truly sets, it can get bright. Both are very helpful to shut-eye and were worth their weight in gold to me. If you’re backpacking it, be sure to check out my backpacking packing list which has all of the gear that I use. It’s also helpful if you’re staying in the huts, just eliminate the tent and sleeping mat. The following is the itinerary I took my BMTMAdventures group on, taking a leisurely pace so that we could enjoy each day, with plenty of time in the huts each night. Though I recommend bringing a map and tracking along on the maps.me offline GPS (download before you go and plot the huts in case it’s super foggy), the trail is usually pretty well marked. You have a couple of options for day one. Either you can make your way to Landmannalaugar, chill in the hot spring and spend the night in the hut to head out the following morning, which is what we did, or you can bus in from Reykjavík early in the morning and start your hike that same day. I’m glad that we gave ourselves some time in the area to do day hikes and to soak in that spring. It’s the perfect combination of scorching hot and cool water that had me straddling the line between the two for a good couple of hours. It also allowed us to start hiking early in the morning the next day when the weather was nicer. Your first day will involve a 470 m gain, passing piping hot fumaroles (The name for the tubes popping out smoke along the trail, just a few letters off from what you’ll experience should you end up falling into one), looking at the striped rock in shades of reds, greens, and oranges, and walking on snow a bit here and there as well. The uphill is mostly gradual except for two very steep parts, which are nearly vertical. However they don’t last long, and there’s no shame in hand and foot scrambling if needed. You’ll finish the day at the highest point of the trail in a basic hut with a few bunk beds with single mattresses and doubles. The doubles are barely larger than a normal twin bed, so try to get there early if you know that you don’t want to share. There are a few side hikes around there as well, but some fairly wretched weather moved in a few minutes after we arrived, so we chilled in the hut and did puzzles for the afternoon. Given how much daylight there is, you will have plenty of time to hike each day. And since each day on this list is fairly short, if you’re a fast hiker you can probably combine one or two of these, particularly if you can’t get a hut reservation on one of the days. This was my favorite day of the Laugavegur trail thanks to the diversity of scenery. We began at the hut, with a chocolate and meringue colored landscape that reminded me of Choco Mountain on Mario Kart (anybody remember that level from N64? Please say yes). The day starts off relatively flat before an uphill climb to a sweeping view of the rainbow colored rocks in the distance. This is one of the last major views of these before descending into what looked to me like Middle-earth about an hour later. If you’re lucky enough to have a clear view, you’ll see a glacier to the left and impossibly green peaks in the valley below. It truly looks like you’re about to descend into another world. There will be a few ups and downs, some of which are quite steep and on clay, which is why I highly recommend hiking poles, before a final steep downhill to the greenery below – and your first river crossing. Obviously each year is different in terms of water levels, but this was a pretty tame river and an easy one to cross. From there, make your way to a more comfortable hut than the previous night (that actually has running water in the bathrooms!) and the potential for hot showers. A few people even went swimming in the lake, which seemed certifiably crazy to me, but to each their own! It would make the hot shower thereafter that much more delightful. There is a restaurant and bar at this hut, so you can order some food if you please. It’s pretty expensive and marginal at best, but it is Iceland after all. Day three will be a bit longer than the previous two days, but it’s also much flatter and without much elevation gain or loss. You’ll pass by another hut, a potential alternative to Álftavatn if you can’t get into that one, followed by a wider river crossing. This one felt much colder to me than the first one, probably because there was more water and it was longer to get across. Still, it was only about knee height on me and not too difficult to traverse. By the way, the best way to cross the river is to face the current rather than the typical method of walking straight. Slide each foot side to side, without crossing them over, and don’t forget to unclip your backpack from your waist. This is the safest way to cross. Next, you’ll more or less leave the green behind to walk across a volcanic field of pebbles and sand with little wildflowers. The landscape is mostly black with dramatic, jagged mountains. This eventually leads you past some glaciers and to a beautiful glacier view at Botnar, which is where you’ll spend the night. Even though the huts on night one were a bit more basic, this was my least favorite because there were so many people in the room. It’s about 25 people to a hut, each with its own kitchen. There are showers available here as well. Similar in length to day three, day four will take you closer to the glacier, and then downhill a bit towards the canyon. There’s a steep descent down to a bridge where you cross the river, followed by the trail along the canyon edge with beautiful views. You’ll follow this before another big uphill and eventual final river crossing for the Laugavegur trail. This is a pretty big river. Although it’s not necessarily deep, it takes a long time to cross because it’s quite wide. I recommend watching other people do it first to see where the better spots to cross are. From here, it’ll be another uphill and then eventually a downhill to Þórsmörk. There are three different huts that you can stay at, though the Langidalur is the most common and also where the bus picks up to take you out and back to Reykjavik. Or, as I mentioned earlier in the post, the best possible thing you can do is keep going onward for two more days to Skógar on the Fimmvorduhals trail. This route will take you past over 20 waterfalls and what was, to me, the most beautiful day of the entire trek on day five, with glacial views and water carved canyons all along the way. It’s also about a 1000 m gain and then loss, but it didn’t feel that intense to me. Be sure to check out my post on that trail to decide if it’s for you. A big factor determining your enjoyment of this trail is going to be something that you can’t control – the weather. If you have heavy fog and can’t see the views, it’s not going to be as exciting, but we found that by leaving earlier in the morning we had a better chance at good weather. It’s also imperative that you’re prepared for the elements. By having a waterproof jacket and making sure that I was warm enough, I was never that uncomfortable. I also have a separate pair of shoes for crossing rivers so that I didn’t have to have wet feet. At least if everything else was soaked, my feet could be warm and dry. I also think staying in a tent would have severely impacted my enjoyment of this trail, considering that they had to deal with crazy strong winds and lots of rain overnight. As much as I love backcountry backpacking, when I know there is a hut nearby, it’s harder for me to enjoy it. Keep in mind that severe weather is part of traveling in Iceland, so if you can afford it, you might want to stay in the huts. All in all the Laugavegur is one of my favorite backpacking trails that I’ve done. The diversity and beauty blew my mind over and over again. I hope this resource has helped you to plan out your Laugavegur trail experience with a bit more info. Stay safe, have a blast, and let me know how it goes for you. Hi Kristin, I am.so glad that I stumbled on your website. I am planning to walk the Laugavegur Trail on my own, in the first week of July. It has been a lot of Years  since I did a multi day hike, so appreciated the tips on your website, to refresh my memory.I am struggling with the Hut  booking process though. Every time I send F island some dates, they say the hut is booked, in fact they say that the Huts are basically booked out for  all of July. Do people just reserve them or do they have to pay for their hut bed up front, ie, when they book.?Perhaps I should try some dates, but walking in the opposite direction , South to North.. maybe this won’t be as busy or heavily booked.Kind regardsLynne It might already be booked out, unfortunately. You can try to take a chance and get last minute bookings but then you’d still have to bring a tent in case they don’t have any.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-packing-list/,The Perfect Iceland Packing List For Any Time of Year,Iceland,"Iceland is a country that can experience several different kinds of weather within one day, or even within one hour! One moment the sun will be shining and the next, you’ll be driving through a storm of hail, wind, and rain. In fact, the wind is so strong, it can blow a car door right off its hinges, seriously! Regardless of the time of year (I’ve been in October and July), bringing waterproof clothing that can protect you from the wind, and potentially snow and hail, is essential to your comfort while traveling through Iceland. Thankfully, the Gulf Stream keeps Iceland’s temperatures from plummeting much below freezing in the winter but its latitude also means that even in the summer, temperatures don’t get much higher than 50°F/10°C. The great thing about the varied weather is it makes Iceland incredibly green and beautiful. Thanks to the rain, often followed directly after by sunlight, it’s the land of waterfalls and rainbows. Who doesn’t love waterfalls and rainbows? Personally, I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t smile at both. So how do you pack for a place that experiences so many different types of weather in one day? Bring layers, and make sure your clothes are waterproof! Here’s the ideal Iceland packing list for any time of year: 2 warm, lightweight undershirts (I also have it in grey) 1 rain jacket (Summer) 1 puffy vest 1 Jacket + alternative (Winter) 2 pairs fleece-lined leggings (Fall + Winter) 2 pairs normal leggings (Summer) 4-5 thin shirts (I recommend this and this as well) 2 thermal shirts 1-2 sweaters 1 bathing suit 1 pack towel Gloves and hat 1-2 pairs snow boots (Fall +Winter) 1 pair waterproof boots (Spring + Summer) Enough socks and undies for your whole trip Camera bag Let’s dive into the specifics: A good jacket is the most important thing, apart from good footwear, that you will pack for your trip to Iceland. If you go any time other than the height of summer, chances are good that you will experience freezing temperatures, especially if you head to the highlands, so something warm that keeps out moisture is essential. During my first trip, we encountered nearly 48 hours of straight rain and snow, so a jacket that got soaked easily would have been a real drag. I was so glad to have my warm jacket along with me, plus, the red was the perfect color for standing out against the background! I spent €250 on my jacket at a department store in Berlin. Online, it’s only available in Sweden, but here’s a jacket that is almost exactly the same and might even a bit cheaper. It comes in black, too! The other item to allot more of your packing budget to is snow boots. These will keep your feet warm and dry, and high-quality ones will stand the test of time, too! I brought two pairs along with me and was glad I did. Though they kept the water out for the most part, that time I was jumping across freezing rivers of water in Landmannalaugar and couldn’t quite clear the water, I dunked my entire leg and was very glad that I had a dry pair of boots back in the camper van. My pairs are wool-lined UGG Brand Elsa boots, and the pair I’m wearing above are a few seasons old, but are just like Sorel’s version which comes in tons of adorable colors and sizes. My fleece-lined leggings were perfect for keeping my legs just warm enough for the temperatures in Iceland, which were right around freezing for most of the time that I was there in October. Thankfully, they’re also super cheap, so I got several pairs of bright and flashy ones and a few black and blue ones, and wore them during the whole trip. You can find a bunch of options here and here. If you’re going in spring or summer, you might not need a super heavy duty snow jacket, but a rain jacket shell is a good idea, and layers that you can put on or take off underneath. I like bright colors, so I brought along a pink shell and wore my thermal layers underneath, which worked out perfectly. Since you’re unlikely to experience any snow in the late spring or summer months (but you never know, of course!), bringing waterproof boots is a good alternative. If you’re doing any hiking, you’ll definitely want them, but even if you’re just walking around the waterfalls, boots that keep out the moisture and have good tread are very helpful for the slippery rocks. I like the Montara boot for all of my hiking trips, but if you want something with a bit more style, Doc Martens would work well, too. You lose so much warmth through your head, so a fleece-lined beanie is a great way to stay toasty and luckily, they’re also very cheap. You can find a bunch of great options in every color here, and patterned ones here. I also keep a pair of rainbow gloves on hand for when night falls. They’re lined with fleece and though I bought mine in the Himalayas in Nepal, you can get a pair here for cheap. The key to staying warm when you hit cooler temperatures and then shedding layers when it gets warmer are cheapie, easy thermals that you can mix and match and layer underneath your jacket. One of the coolest things to do while in Iceland is visit the public swimming pools, which are super popular with the locals. Just about every town, no matter how small, seems to have one. They have showers and pools of varying heat up to 104°F/40°C, and are a great way to unwind after a day of adventures. What’s more, you’ll definitely want a suit for your visit to the Blue Lagoon. Additionally, be sure to bring along a pair of jeans or pants, a thick scarf, lots of warm and thick socks, ample undies, lots of thin, long-sleeved shirts to layer, a few pairs of normal leggings to layer or wear on their own in case it’s a bit warmer during the day, and a camera bag with a waterproof sleeve. To review, here’s the full list: Check out this kit for easy ordering:  I’m in love with those leggings! In fact I just went to snoop around the internet to find a couple of cheap pairs, I hate wearing jeans and those would be perfect in the Finnish winter. Just noticed on the sidebar that you’re travelling to Finland soon, which cities are you going to visit? I’ll be in Lapland 🙂 You’re amazing at looking good in winter gear; I’m going to be copying this list if (when) I go to Iceland! Thank you! It’s a whole new world of fashion I never dealt with before but I’m finding wintery places to be awesome. Just have to be dressed right for them. I’m not even thinking of going to Iceland anytime soon but I still read this whole thing through. Just procrastinating. I’m basically drowning in books studying for the FSOT to work in the foreign service. So I’m taking a break to read and re-read your travel adventures to remind myself what it’s all for! Thanks for the inspiration! Aw that warms my heart. Thanks so much and I’m so glad it keeps you motivated. Good luck with your studies! Do you think these same things will be needed for August as well? Or would I be too warm? I’d always pack warmly for Iceland. The weather changes so quickly! Wil this list will work for Auckland New Zealand winters? I’m going in July! Should work for most winter destinations! Awesome post Kristin!I’ll be visiting Iceland this August and im stoked, however im still a bit puzzled on what I should pack.Can you confirm that, even during summer, the weather is wild and can go through drastic changes?Also, would you be able to tell me what the average price is for gasoline?I’ve also read that people would recommend diesel cars because it’ll be “cheaper.”  Safe travels from a fellow Southern Californian. I only ever found one kind of gas there and don’t recall it being that expensive, but that was in October and a few friends who had been the year before experienced double the price so I can’t be sure what it’ll be for you in August. Yes, be prepared for any kind of weather! I thought that in Iceland there is only glaciers. But even there you can swim! We are visiting Iceland in june- very excited?How does the access to the camp sites work- do we need to buy an access card/book in advance  before leaving on our trip? will be great to hear from you. I didn’t book in advance but June might be more crowded so might want to look into it. The campsites will be open, charging, and more crowded then. Thanks for the great article! I live in NE Florida and am a little stumped about what to pack. Sure it gets cold here, but we don’t have snow boots lying around and I’d rather not invest too much money in this that I could spend on the trip! Do you think I can improvise by bringing my snowboarding jacket (http://bit.ly/29UPbxr), snowboard pants, LL Bean boots (6 inch), my steel-toed boots from work for hiking and lots of leggings and thinner tops for layers? I carry a backpack when traveling. I think that should all work. The main thing is you just want it to be waterproof, and layers always help so if you’re too cold, add another and if you’re too hot, take one off. So glad i found this list! Fleece lined leggings are the mvps! We are heading to Iceland in October as well, hopefully the weather is good! We have also gone with the campervan plan for more freedom! Goodness! This is marvelous… I’ve been tailing you for such quite a while on Instagram ? I’m at last anticipating going to Iceland next spring. Would you be able to in any case observe northern lights in Spring? Thanks for your great activity on this article. It would behoove you to get there before daylight savings time but possibly! how is it to book the blue lagoon in advance? worried if i get stuck in a reservation for a rainy day that i will want to visit on another day It’s probably a good idea to book in advance because it’s so popular. If it rains it’s still cool because the water is so warm! Thank you for the packing list. Leaving for Iceland on the 31st of december to have a great start of the year (and an Icelandic new years eve). Do you have a reconmendation on where to rent a car? Depends on what you plan on doing! I used a 4×4 since I wanted to deviate from the ring road a bit. More on that here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-camping/ You are an inspiration!! Took your photography class and learned so much from them. Will be going to Iceland in the summer and used your guide to plan our trip. Thank you!! Amazing! Have such a great time and share your pics! I want to see them! Thank you so much for sharing. This pretty well documented experience.Thanks again Kristin, A.M Thanks for this article, I’ll be ready to do the packing for October! Excited! 🙂 Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-itinerary/,The Perfect Iceland Ring Road Itinerary,Iceland,"Iceland is a microcosm of rugged, real, and surreal all wrapped up into one little island. I know this sounds like hyperbole but I was overwhelmed almost to the brink of crying tears of joy from what I saw during the week I spent driving Iceland’s Ring Road, the highway 1 that circles the perimeter of the country covering 828 miles (1332 km). The landscape changed constantly, providing perfect photo ops at every turn. Really, just about every single turn! I just couldn’t believe that scenery could really look like that on earth. There were so many waterfalls, we just stopped pointing them out to each other the third day into the drive, and the landscape changed so often, we never got bored. One of my early goals was to find some places in Iceland that weren’t written about as much, or where I might escape other tourists. Some of the following on this itinerary are tourist favorites (and rightly so), and some you might just get all to yourself. Some are accessible with any kind of car, and some require a 4×4. Some are directly off of the ring road, and some require a (worthwhile) detour. Keep in mind that when driving the Ring Road, you’ll want a minimum of seven days to do it. More would be even better and will allow you to see way more of the scenery. I left wishing I’d had a month on that beautiful island. Here were my favorites from that week. Choose your own adventure: There’s no right or wrong direction to head on the Ring Road. You can go north or south, but we chose to go south first because we were chasing clear skies for a chance to see the northern lights, a plan that paid off. Check the aurora forecast if you’re in Iceland at a time of year when you will have some dark skies (not in the summertime) and plan accordingly. If you haven’t had a chance to check out Iceland’s golden circle yet, it’s definitely worth the detour and is a great way to start your Ring Road trip (check out my post on how to avoid the crowds on this popular road and some extra ideas too!). I’d already had 48 hours in Iceland so I started on the Ring Road right away, bound for Landmannalaugar in the highlands because the photos of its painted mountains looked spectacular. This is the exact car that I used and I thought it was fantastic. We spent that day almost entirely in the car, mostly because the rain and wind were so heavy that I was terrified – honestly, terrified – to step outside for longer than a minute. Plus, driving on the 4×4 roads at 10-20km/hour takes a lot of time. Even though we spent most of the day in the car, it was still an awesome day as the scenery was pretty incredible. We started to question if we had accidentally ended up on another planet when we came to the part of the road pictured above, which looks like a black and white photo but in reality, the landscape was black as far as the eye could see. If you don’t have a 4×4 but still want to see the highlands, tours depart daily from Reykjavik and will take you to the same place, though you won’t have the freedom to stop for photos when you want to along the way. Map: Landmannalaugar Camp: The wind and rain were so scary strong that day that the road to the campgrounds closed due to flooding (check road closures here), so we had to find a dead end to hole up in until the morning. This was fine given nobody was crazy enough to drive that road in that weather in the dark, and the nice camper van had heating and kitchenette. After a cup of whiskey to chase the fear away I slept like a baby – rocking back and forth in the (strong as h$@l) wind. I’ve heard great things about the whole F-208 road, but unfortunately due to flooding and closures, we couldn’t go any further than Landmannalaugar and never got to check out the camp 30km away. I awoke to snowy surroundings and thanked the universe for letting me live through the previous night’s storm. Landmannalaugar is a great place to hike for an hour or two, though one could do so for days or even weeks, so we explored a bit, eager to see the mountains that looked like painted hills. Hiking around took half of the day while retracing our steps and heading back to the Ring Road filled the other. We spent most of it jumping over about two dozen freezing streams of water across the valley and finding a waterfall, only to lose the trail in the snow and jump right back over them to head back to the starting point. Our goal for the rest of the afternoon was to thaw out, dry off, and make it to Seljalandsfoss for an AM viewing of the waterfall, especially since sunrise there is particularly famous. Technically, I didn’t really start driving the actual Ring Road in the daytime until day three. But my, what a dazzling introduction it turned out to be. Map: Seljalandsfoss Camp: There’s a great little campsite right next to Seljalandsfoss. Highly recommended if you’d like to catch the sunrise at the falls! Waking up to a massive waterfall is an excellent way to start the day, and I simply can’t believe I hadn’t tried it until hitting Iceland. I suppose I can credit that to few opportunities, but everyone should do it at least once! Seljalandsfoss is popular with tourists, so don’t expect to get it to yourself, and you will get wet if you want to get behind it for photos. We didn’t get a sunrise that day thanks to the clouds. That said, it is impressive, and the drive from there to Skógafoss is delightful, punctuated with tons of waterfalls and green misty mountains. Skógafoss Skógafoss is also popular with tourists thanks to its massive flow and relative proximity to Reykjavik. It’s very close to the Ring Road and worth a quick photo stop. I’m not exaggerating when I say that we saw hundreds of waterfalls streaming from green cliff edges and volcanic basalt columns throughout the drive. I kept wondering to myself how one waterfall could be more famous than another considering there must be thousands, no exaggeration, all across Iceland. There are tons that you’ll pass during the trip that would all be famous if they existed in other countries. But in Iceland, waterfalls are a dime a dozen. Fjaðrárgljúfur I got the inspiration to visit Fjaðrárgljúfur, along with most of the other places we stopped at, from a combination of looking around Instagram for suggestions and consulting a big picture book that my buddy Maksim brought (which was in German, but there’s a similar English version here). For us, the easiest way to pick and choose was visually. If one of us enthusiastically said, “Wow, I really want to go there!” we added it to the itinerary if we could possibly fit it. Fjaðrárgljúfur is a canyon that is 100 m deep and about 2 km long and was likely created during the last ice age. I dug it because it gave me multiple opportunities to be really foolish and hang around the edge of things, something I have a habit of doing (which, if you watch my snapchat with any regularity, you already know: @krislikewhaat). A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Oct 6, 2015 at 7:06am PDT  There were tons of places to stop along the drive, so we did just that, enjoying our first day of sunshine. Next thing I knew, we rounded a curve and there was a giant glacier, and stretching out from under it, a black sand sea that stretched onwards for miles to the horizon. Maksim asked me what I’d do if I saw northern lights over the glacier lagoon that night as I frowned at the cloud cover above. I told him I could die happy if that happened and an hour later, he called me outside and there they were: Maps: Skógafoss, Fjaðrárgljúfur, the Black Waterfall (Svartifoss), Jökulsárlón Iceberg lagoon Camp: We arrived at the Jökulsárlón Iceberg lagoon just after dark and were worried when we didn’t see any camping options. Luckily after checking their website it turned out camping is allowed in a contained camper van or RV. Score! Maksim and I woke up to a glorious sunrise. It was the first we’d seen in days due to the rain but it made up for the inclement weather in the highlands when a rainbow arced down to the glacier lagoon. This was a big driving day for us. There was a lot that we wanted to see in the north and the aurora forecast looked bleak due to cloud cover everywhere with the exception of a spot over 445km away. We wanted to see them again and figured it was our best chance. We turned out to be happily, gloriously correct. The Eastern Fjords are lovely, and I suggest stopping whenever you see something beautiful for a photo or even taking little detours from the Ring Road for some of the coastal towns. We didn’t feel we had time for that (as it was we barely made it back to Reykjavik within the seven days we allotted), so we stuck to the Ring Road. There’s a lot you can do that we missed out on, such as ice cave trekking, which was booked out way farther in advance than I’d bargained for, or helicopter tours of the active volcanoes, but the nature of the Ring Road trip is that you’ll have to pick and choose – you can’t do it all. That night before the sun had even fully set, the northern lights came out and started dancing. The sky was completely clear and dark, giving us a dazzling display that beat out the first night’s, snaking across the sky and dancing like lines of classical music across the pages of a hauntingly enchanting song. How else can I describe it? It brought tears to my eyes. Map: Asbyrgi Camp: Asbyrgi has awesome camp grounds equipped with showers, sinks, clean bathrooms, and places to charge your electronics. Most of day five was spent on foot rather than in a car, which was a welcome change from the day before which was quite the opposite. Maksim and I elected to do the A8 trail, which takes you to the canyon view from the top and over to the river on the other side, spanning 12 kilometers. The trail was marked as red which means “difficult” but honestly I don’t know what whoever ranked that trail was smoking (a lot of weed, apparently), because the trail wasn’t difficult at all, and even those with limited fitness could do it. What I loved about it was an aerial view of the fall foliage below, plus landscape that seriously looked like the moon. The middle part was my favorite, feeling like an astronaut for an hour, followed by fields that were so red and orange, they appeared to be on fire. If you have time to do this and enjoy hiking, definitely squeeze it in. Maps: Husavik Camp: The drive from there to the campgrounds at Húsavík is a quick one, so take a dip at the bath house in the town and enjoy the evening. Whale watching is a popular activity in Húsavík mostly because the chances of seeing them are around 97-99%, so might as well, right? The tour we took was around €75 and took three hours and we were able to see a Humpback Whale come up and swim around several times before heading back to the harbor. From there, Maksim and I went waterfall chasing: We took the 4×4 for another spin on a road that is closed off to normal vehicles, because we wanted to check out what was poised to be the coolest waterfall of all with even more basalt columns than Svartifoss has: This is Aldeyjarfoss, which was my favorite waterfall in Iceland. This, plus the highlands, definitely justified getting the 4×4 version of our camper van. Without much of an idea where to head after that, we checked in with Instagram again and discovered Hvitserkur, a rock in the ocean that looked cool enough to check out. That night ended up having the most active auroras of all, which I took a couple quick pictures of but then elected to just watch and enjoy:   Maps: Godafoss, Aldeyjarfoss, Hvitserkur Camp: We spent the night at Hvitserkur, which I think is a no-no, but we didn’t have much choice after arriving long after dark and spotting the northern lights again which we, naturally, had to stay and stare at. Day seven involved a couple more detours in order to see more amazing waterfalls before finishing up the trip and heading back to Reykjavik. We found Barnafoss on Instagram and wanted to take the chance to see if it still had the fall colors we’d seen from a couple weeks prior: It added another hour or so to the trip and we were glad, once again, to have a car that could handle some back country roads when we took a short cut to get there. Next, we elected to make the several-hour detour to see our final waterfall of Iceland, Kirkjufellsfoss: It was the cherry on top of a perfect Iceland Ring Road trip. I’ve enclosed two maps below, broken up since theres a max amount of stops per map that I can embed, beginning in Reykjavik. Here’s the map for days 1-5 (ish):  And for days 5-7/8:  One to habitually look a gift horse in the mouth, I wondered, will Iceland ruin everything that comes after it? Will anything be impressive to me ever again? Of course it’s impossible as each country has its own special and unique beauty, but in Iceland, it’s easy to forget that anything else exists, you’re so wrapped up in the sights before you. I hope you find these tips helpful and if you take this trip, let me know! Wow! So many different landscapes within one little(ish) country! So glad you’ve captured them all with your camera to share with us. Definitely makes me want to make a visit of my own! Did you find the roads to be easily driven, or are road conditions something to consider when planning an Icelandic road trip? Luckily for me, my friend Maksim drove and he’s used to driving in bad conditions. One day the rain and wind was so heavy I was actually terrified. I wouldn’t have been able to drive in it but he was a great captain. If you aren’t used to snow or heavy rain and wind I’d take that into consideration As an Icelandic guide I wanna fill in a bid. Driving in Iceland can be weary dangeres lot of site winds, icy roads, mist and rain and cloudy and of course bliserd there are lot of dangeres korners on our roads, lot of tourist stop in middle of the road for photos and that is dangeres to so always find parking spots. If the sign says road close than it dos not mean that you can drive on it in small Yaris? Many tourists do it hehehe. Any way you have amazing photos from my country.Sorry my spellings.With cinde regardsHilmar Valur Jensson tour guide Hello, is it possible to visit landmannalaugar in may? Around 15/18 may? Or is the road too bad? You might be able to get there with a 4×4. Breathtaking, fabulous, surreal…Box Canyon Mark What company did you rent your camper van from? My husband and I are looking to do the same thing in September and have just started researching everything we can on Iceland. Go Campers and I highly recommend them! The staff is great, the vehicle was in great condition, it had everything we needed, and the price is right. http://www.gocampers.is/ Ah! Your photos are gorgeous! But I bet Iceland is even more beautiful in person It’s pretty unbelievable Breathtaking! These places look absolutely beautiful, and your photos are so good I want to get to Iceland immediately! Thank you so much! Thank you for the inspiration. Checking into adding one month in Iceland before embarking on 8 month backpacking journey in SEA. We are mid 50’s and still traveling. Never lose sight of your dreams. Awesome, Tom. That sounds like an epic trip! And so varied, too. I’d say the star of the show was your red jacket :). Looking forward to getting there with my #greenjacket this year hopefully. Your photos look like if they were taken in the fairytale! Iceland is on top of my bucket list, I hope to visit this amazing country in 2016 🙂 Fjaðrárgljúfur (yes I had to copy and paste that, and I won’t even try to pronounce it…) was probably my favorite photo in this itinerary, but all of it looks amazing. And It’s just so hard to believe all of this is in one country. I’ll keep all of these in mind for when I go! Yeah, I couldn’t believe how varied it was too! SO much to see all packed into one island 3 questions:1. My wife loves your boots. What brand are they?2. Was your camper van 4×4?3. We are going Oct. 5th – 16th this year. Does that line up with when you went? Hoping it’s still somewhat green. 1) They’re Ugg brand but I bought them years ago. I found a similar style here: http://amzn.to/1UknvhJ2) Yes3) Yes I went from October 1-10! Great timing but it’s not AS green as during the summer. It’s red, yellow, orange, and if you ask me, way more beautiful with the fall foliage. I’m going to Iceland next summer, and I came here looking for some inspiration… and inspired I was! Thanks a lot for sharing my itinerary. Some of your pictures made me feel like WOW I have to see that… Iceland is magical. I’m so looking forward to this trip. I meant of course “your”* itinerary! I guess I was too quick to make it mine in my head, because it looks so awesome 😉 Haha, if you do follow this itinerary let me know! I love it when people try out my suggestions and enjoy them! Great travel advice for future trekkers to my fair country!I can wholeheartedly recommend the stops you mentioned. Just one thing I might add for visitors to Iceland  (and sorry if you mentioned it already and I missed it):  When you feel the need to stop and snap a picture (and believe me, you´ll want to do that very frequently), make sure your car is towards the side of the road, or even off the road if possible…don´t stop at a “blind” turn….and please, please, keep in mind, that off-road driving is nowhere allowed (even on the black sands on the south coast).  Enjoy your trip to Iceland! Hi Bjorn, so glad to see that a local agrees with my suggestions! In my 24 things you need to know post I mention both of those things: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-camping/ I remember hearing a story of some tourists who went off roading on a black sand beach then had to spend hours raking it all back into place! Gorgeous pictures! We are planning a trip in April – I hope we can get to some of these places! How did you find navigating around on the roads? Did you use a GPS? Are the road signs in English? I got a local SIM card and it had amazingly good coverage and wasn’t expensive from Vodafone and that was the best method. The signs for each place are in Icelandic. There isn’t really an English alternative. We are planning a 26 day trip to Iceland in August/September 2016. This will also include a 3 day stop over in Aukeryi and an overnight stay on Grimsey. Should be a great trip – thanks for the info. Awesome guide, I’ll be doing the same trip this summer and you’ve gotten me even more excited, if that was possible! Great post! woohoo! My best friend and I are going to Iceland in a couple of weeks — 2-8 May — and your blog has been incredibly helpful in planning! We really want to get to Landmannalaugar but I am reading that the F roads will not be open in early May but I see you were able to access it in October. Any guess on the chances of our being able to get there in our rented 4×4 or advice on affordable alternative ways to access it? Thank you! They usually close the roads due to flooding and in May perhaps they expect a lot of snow melt. I have seen tour busses go there and we took a 4×4 rental. If you’re thinking of renting one I highly recommend gocampers.is they were great and will probably be able to answer your questions! Thank you so much for sharing your experiences and recommendations. We will be touring Iceland this July.  I’m sure out trip will be most efficient and enhanced by your suggestions. Very stylish boots Thanks for sharing! If I’m reading right, you camped in your Camper Van each night? Where did you shower and how did you stay warm? Assuming the nights get cold. I am trying to plan a trip for late September/early October! I slept in the camper van every night, yes. There are bath houses in every small town where you can shower and the van had a heater inside so we stayed nice and toasty. Details here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-camping/ HI! Thanks for sharing your itinerary! Just wondering if you remember roughly how much you spent on gas? I’ve read that the gas prices are exhoborant and I’d just like an idea of how much we need. Thanks!! Wasn’t much more than at home at the time but they rise and fall so what I paid might have nothing to do with what the price is now Hi, How easy it to see Icelandic horses? We are thinking of going to Iceland for 3.5 days in October and originally I was thinking of doing a horseback tour but now I think I’d rather see Kirkjufellsfoss but I still want pictures of the horses. Thanks! They’re all over. You’ll see them if you take a road trip. Loved this article!!! I’m planning an 8-day trip in Late September with my husband. While I love the idea of a camper van for the freedom it would allow, I’m very worried about the weather (I’m a Southerner with a low tolerance for being cold!). Even if we can stay nice and toasty inside the van, there would still be the chilly trek to the bathrooms/showers as well as having to be outside to cook (at least in the camper models I’ve seen). I fear making myself miserable, but really love the idea of not having to lock in accommodations well in advance. How did you decide that a camper van was the way to go and how did you deal with the weather? Thanks and I appreciate your advice. Hi Gena, we didn’t cook outside until the last night because we were cold, too. You can cook inside if you crack the windows and just boil food instead of frying it. there’s also a ventilation thingy at the top of the van. We had a space heater so we were more than fine inside. Yes, though, you’ll have to go out to use the bathroom. That part is tough when it’s cold or rainy but I will put up with those small discomforts in exchange for the freedom of the van. SO worth it! Thanks! I can’t wait for our 1st anniversary adventure! Hi ! Me and my boyfriend are going to Iceland for two weeks in july/august. Your itinerary seems perfect and I was wondering if you remember how much it cost you for gaz ?  Thank you, Gas is always fluctuating so I didn’t give a figure here but it wasn’t too bad for me at the time. About like home. I just read every word you wrote about spending time in Iceland and it made me want to travel even now, and sooner to boot! Just incredible the way you highlight everything of importance. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! What great tips you offered! I am planning to take my two boys (I’m the mom) to Iceland for a month. We just got back from a month-long UK road trip, so next year is probably when we will be going to Iceland. I loved your descriptions of the rain storms and am actually looking forward to them! I’m wondering if Spring is as awesome as Fall, though. That’s when we usually do our traveling (we home school, so it’s cool). The Northern Lights are definitely on our bucket list, so summer is out of the question. Any way, thanks for the great summary!! Wow a month there will be awesome! I wish I could have stayed that long. There was so much hiking and outdoorsy stuff to do! I’m sure that any time of year there is beautiful in its own way. Have fun! How much did you and your friend spend in gas for the total trip? I am taking the trip in late October and was wondering how much money needed to be set aside for gas. Your trip looks like it was so amazing we just might follow your itinerary! The prices rise and fall and that was a year ago which is why I haven’t given a gas price. It wasn’t so bad when we were there. About $5-6 per gallon but at other times it has been closer to $8 Hey Kristin! We found you through your Easter Island guest post on Nomadic Matt’s site. Great article, btw 🙂 Reading about your road trip brings back a TON of memories. Though we didn’t have a chance to visit the highlands (nor were we lucky enough to catch the Northern Lights), we did cover a lot of the same sights. We had wondered whether we took too many photos, and included too many in our posts, but judging by your article, it seems like that’s just what happens when travelling in Iceland! Fortunately, we had two weeks for the ring road so we were able to take our time. It looks like you had some great weather, though. The bad driving conditions were the most extreme for us on our way across the Westfjords to visit the Puffins of Látrabjarg. Bumpy, cliffside roads coupled with extreme fog can be terrifying. Glad we all lived to tell our stories! All the best, Adamo & Joey– The Gays Abroad Glad you guys enjoyed your time there as well! I don’t think it’s possible to take too many photos! Iceland is soooo photogenic, too. I was there with my friend Maksim who did the driving. He’s from the Ukraine so he was used to all kinds of weather while I sat there in the passenger seat terrified of the storms. I wouldn’t have been able to do it without him! Hey Kristin,I really like your Blog and I got a lot of useful information from it. So thanks a lot 🙂 A friend of mine and me are going to Iceland this late September/early October. We have car, that is not a camper, but still big enough to sleep in. However, since we have a very good and stable tent, we would love to sleep in it from time to time. Do you think that this will still be possible during the first days of October, since most sites close at the first of the month.  Information for further usability is very scarce and mixed. If weather will be too heavy we will book some additional accommodations for some of the days.  Another question I have is whether you think we will be able to do a circle around Iceland alongside the Ringroad, without having a 4X4? We are not planing on heading towards the Highlands away from Road1… Would be very happy to hear some further advice from you 🙂 The campsites were still open for use when I was there even though there was nobody there to run it or collect a fee. Sometimes it was just me and a few other people there.  You’ll be really cold sleeping in a tent. It’ll be around freezing or below each night. If you have really good sleeping bags and gear then it might work. You can do the ring road without a 4×4 but not the highlands and not all the waterfalls. Have fun! I am planning one of my next road-trip to Iceland. So thank you for your help with this post. Very helpful. Kristin,I’m heading to Reyk Aug. 31 – Sep 7 and I’m so so happy to have stumbled on this entry. We’ve rented a non 4×4 so I know some of this will probably be difficult or even impossible. Also, we’re planning to tent camp almost every night as there are four of us. Did you sleep in the van every night, or did you camp outdoors from time to time? As you went a month later than we’re planning, we hope that the weather will be a bit more friendly but who knows.. Did you see a lot of outdoor camping available? We are hoping to be able to hike from wherever we park the car and camp out in the earthy areas and not necessarily super established campsites. Do you think that would be possible? Also, very curious as to what kind of camera you are shooting with here. Any other tips? Thanks again for your awesome itinerary. I only slept in the van and we used the van’s space heater. It was needed since we got snow. You can’t go to the highlands and just one of the waterfalls we went to without a 4×4 so you’ll still see a lot. You can camp at the same places that I parked for camping. This is my camera info: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-improve-my-travel-photography/ Love your blog! Your tips are so helpful. My dad and I will be visiting Iceland October 2-10, we rented a happy camper for the trip. Your post makes me feel better about the cold, I was worried we would freeze in the camper. Do you have a suggestion for planning the road trip? I love your itinerary, I’m just concerned about timing as the days will be shorter in August. Do you just map out your trip prior and try your best to estimate the timing? We went at the same time of year and had the same daylight. Just aim for where you want to get to and amend the itinerary as you go, that’s what I always do everywhere I go 🙂 Hi Kristin,  Do you mind me asking what your rough budget was for this trip? I’m looking to do one very similar and want to get an idea of how much to save/bring etc. I haven’t had a chance to read all of your posts, so maybe you have one with this information that I missed. Thanks! Here you go! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-does-it-cost-to-travel-in-iceland/ Hi Kristin – my husband and I have hired a 4×4 campervan to travel round Iceland in April 2017.  We are however just discovering that the majority of campsites are only open 1 July – 1 September! I note that you went in October, so also “out of season”.  Where did you park your van to sleep? (I have read that going off road etc is illegal).  Similarly, where did you shower?!  Our draft itinerary is very very similar to yours by the looks of things, so if you are able to let me know where you parked up to sleep and where you showered that would be really amazingly helpful!Thank you!x The campsites are closed but they leave the parking lots open so that people have somewhere to go. almost every town, no matter how small, has bathhouses so you can shower there 🙂 Thanks Kristin.  Did your van have a toilet then (as I assume the toilet facilities at the campsites are also closed)? The toilets were open and no the van does not. Thanks Kristin – that’s super helpful!! 🙂 I’m going to end up doing some of this next year! So stoked! My friend is getting married in Iceland, so I mean… As if I needed more of an excuse to go. 🙂 Thanks for all the tips, Kristin! This was a great post! My boyfriend and I are travel photographers and will be traveling to Iceland in November! Only 1 month away!!!!! Crazy! It sounds absolutely stunning and other worldly! Thanks for the blog post…it gave us some great ideas! Thanks for this info-loaded article. Am planning a road trip there for 2017. Would I lose out on a lot of the sights if I rent a bigger campervan vs the smaller 4×4 that you rented? Thanks!! The highlands and Aldeyjarfoss, which was my favorite waterfall in Iceland. You’ll still be able to see tons of amazing things, though. Hi Kristin! Cheers to 2016 & Happy 2016 to you!I’m wondering if you’re able to share your itinerary map with me?Thank you! P.S. Your post is awesome! Hi Keane, there’s a link to each place on Google maps right before the camping suggestions under each place where it says ‘map’. Have fun! Hi Kristin!My husband and I are planning to follow your trip in September. We also looked at the gocamper site, but a 4×4 camper van for 2 weeks costs over 4000€. Thats quite insane in my opinion 🙁 Due to budget restrains we are looking t rent a normal 4×4 which is about 800€ and then combine that with a tent. However you also wrote, that its quite windy, so not sure what to do. Any tips from your end?Loved your itiniary by the way, and AMAZING fotos!!! Hi Linda, a few people have been saying lately that the price is really high for the camper vans. It seems like they raised it. I’m surprised that it’s 4,000, though! However, I only rented it for about a week, so my cost was much lower. I do think that the wind could be a factor in a tent. However I camped in that kind of weather in Patagonia and survived, it just wasn’t pleasant. You could always opt to do guesthouse rooms if you see that the weather is too heavy for you. Driving the ring road at the end of May in five days.  Do you have suggestions on an itinerary to cut it down to five days and which cities to stay in (Hotel)?  We know…. not enough time, but it’s all we have. You could head south then backtrack. That’s a beautiful part. I didn’t stay in any hotels but Vik is a good one with lots of options. Beautiful post and beautiful photographs. I grew up in the East Fjords and you captured the beauty and contrast perfectly. I do think that 7 days on the ring road is pretty fast-I traveled the whole road in 10 days and feel like it was a bit of a whirlwind. But with Icelandair’s 7 day stopover this is perfect! Glad you like the photos! 7 days is super fast and I would have loved more time! He Kristin, we are just back from agreat trip, thanks for all the info, … regards Wouter Hi! Im going to Iceland with my boyfriend on September 21 for about 10, 15 days (havent booked the ticket back)Our plan was to rent a campervan and do the ring road, but some Icelanders kind of scared us saying its really dangerous if we are not used to it. Is this so?Would it make ant difference just renting a car and stay at hotels?Should it definitely be a 4X4 car? Also, when you talk about all the hikings you did, were they on your own or with tours?I would prefer a self-travel more than an organized one. Great post!!, thanks for all the info and the amazing pictures!!! Why would it be dangerous? I don’t really get that. A 4×4 is necessary for some of the spots, like the highlands. I didn’t do any tours in Iceland. Hi – I read this post last year (which is just so  helpful) and followed the comments but have just come back to it as I’m sending it to a friend who is due to go to Iceland later this year. Can I ask what camera you used to shot the amazing photos? It’s here! http://amzn.to/2m16fTu(affiliate link) What an incredible journey! We loved Iceland and we’re off again for New Year this December. We’d love to drive the ring road but have been advised against it in winter.What camera did you use to capture the Northern Lights? We struggled with our Nikon D3300. I used a Sony A6000 for these and just upgraded to the A7S and it’s incredible how much better the latter is in low light. I’ve found that you kind of have to pay up if you want great low light cameras. I love that you did the whole road!  I recognized a lot of the photos.  I’m really glad someone else would describe it as nearly causing tears.. I felt the same way.  There can’t possibly be a place with more chances for scenic photography than Iceland.   I was especially amazed at some of the places you don’t hear about often, like the unpaved interior roads of Snaefellsnes, and the incredible thousands of tiny waterfalls everywhere descending to the coast on the eastern side of the country near Djupivogur.  For 90% of the time we were there (mid september with even days/nights hours), we felt like we were the only people around.. it was rare to see other cars or people! I was surprised by how uncrowded it seemed as well! HI Kristin, amazing photos and a detail blog. We are planning to take a road trip in late july for 7 nights and I am wondering how did you organize the direction from one place / attraction to other. We have decided what to see in each place but little nervous we might get lost. Is Google map reliable or will the car rental place will help us program in GPS. Please advise. If you happen to have a detail direction map please share with me.  Reuben I used Vodafone the whole time for my GPS and it was great. It’s just the one major road so it’s hard to get lost. Me and my husband are planning a trip to iceland for our anniversary in October. Do you have a map of the campsites? You can camp at all the stops I suggested and there are google maps linked for each 🙂 Your post are exactly what I need to plan for my next trip! This is awesome and I thank you for that. Catching Aurora is one of my ultimate bucketlist! Wishing you all the best on your future adventures. Why did you say:” We spent the night at Hvitserkur, which I think is a no-no”. What is wrong with spending a night in the Hvitserkur?Thank you. It’s the parking lot of the rock arch that I don’t think you’re supposed to camp at. HI Kristin,Loved this post. My husband and I are going in October. Was wondering where your awesome red coat was from? Thanks!! It’s a Swedish brand called Saki and I wish that they sold them online! So many people have asked. I can only find them for sale within Sweden when I look at their site. I bought it at a department store in Berlin. Hi Kristin, the trip sounds amazing! I’m hoping to do the ringroad in the winter (January/February) next year. I’ve seen a few sites that advise against doing the ringroad in the winter (due to possibility of road closure/snow etc) and was wondering what your thoughts were on this? Did you experience any road closures or get caught out in snow storms? I went in October and there was a road closure due to flooding but it wasn’t on the ring road, it was in the highlands. I am sure it’s always a possibility that roads can be closed but at least in those months you have a good chance of seeing the northern lights! What clothing did you bring!? Here you go! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-packing-list/ Thank you! your article was very helpful in planning out our 12 day visit next year. Last year we toured the golden circle and we cant wait to return and travel with a 4×4 in the highlands. Awesome! I LOVE your blogs! Just got back from 10 days on the Iceland Ring Road. Relied heavily on your blog. So informative! And FUN to read! Your pictures are gorgeous! We took a Campervan for flexibility and to get out of the weather. Your packing list is fantastic!I am so greatful that you write these blogs. My niece is headed to Patagonia in January and I recommended your blog to her.Thank you for all your hard work to make it easy on the rest of us!And, most of all, thank you for your iinspiration! Thanks for coming back to comment and let me know, Linda! So glad you found it helpful and had a good time! Did you need to rent a sleeping bag from Go Campers since there is a space heater in the van? They provided bedding if memory serves. HI! We are travelling for 5 days in iceland in the next two weeks. We rented a camper van volkswagen caddy so not a 4×4. on your iterinary list, which area area are we good to visit without to worry of not having a 4×4 vehicle? Just the highlands and Aldeyjarfoss. I updated the post to reflect that. Thanks for asking – others were probably also wondering! I love your blog. it’s so stuffed. I feel like I’m ready to go to Iceland. Lols!Thank you for all the info you shared. Nice article and itinerary, similar to ours this July. My favorite part of Seljalandfoss was the falls about 300m down the trail. It is hidden in a crevice and we had to wade in a creek a short ways into the crevice.  It was like water falling from the high ceiling of a cavern. Hi there, was so impressed with your itinerary of iceland.  I am planning a trip to iceland this sept/oct 19 and hope you can give me some tips.My plan is to do the golden circle route 190km from Reykjavik to the Thingvellir National Park to Vik to Hof and than to Hofn, stay for 2 -3 nights in Hofn before driving the same route and making a detour to Blue Lagoon before Reykjavik.Hope you can advise me on the number of days and where to stay on this route.Many thanks I’m really not sure – it depends on how often you stop and what you want to see. Hi Kristin,  Loving this travel blog!  My girlfriend & I are planning a similar itinerary at the end of June (just after riding bikes around the Ring Road at Wow Cyclothon) and can’t wait to witness this beautiful place.  Question:  Do you need to plan for & reserve camping spots?  From your itinerary, it seems that wasn’t necessary but I want to make sure we have everything taken care of before we arrive.  Thanks again!  Paul Hi Paul, glad you’ve enjoyed the blog! I would reserve in June, since it’s high season then. Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-does-it-cost-to-travel-in-iceland/,The Cost of Traveling in Iceland (and How to Save),Iceland,"Iceland has increasingly become a more popular tourist destination thanks to its incredible landscape and cheap flights from Europe and North America. While the country is expensive, Iceland is the kind of beautiful that makes it worth the cost of visiting, and there’s so much that you can see and do even if you only have 48 hours or in my case, 10 days. That’s a pretty short trip for me, considering I tend to spend a month or longer in each country I visit. That wasn’t in the cards for Iceland, but by splurging on certain things and saving on others, my buddy, Maksim, and I were able to enjoy the country with maximum freedom and minimal costs. My personal spend for 11 days in Iceland was $937 before the flight, or $93 per day. Here’s the breakdown: Maksim and I might have been able to stay for a bit cheaper in Reykjavik had we gone for a hostel dorm room, but I honestly feel like those days are behind me now after doing dorms for 2 years straight in Southeast Asia. We rented an Airbnb flat with two warm and cozy rooms and a nice big living room and kitchen. Here are hostel suggestions and here are hotel suggestions, if you’d prefer to go that route. There are hostels and pensions all along the ring road that you can stay in as well, but I much preferred renting a 4×4 camper van, which would probably work out to almost the same price. Additionally, with a camper van, you can go anywhere you please and that kind of flexibility allowed us to camp right next to a glacier lagoon, famous waterfalls, and to explore the highlands. I took an airport transfer from the airport to the hotel nearest to my apartment rental in Reykjavik and then got a $75 rental for the two days that we were staying in the city from Sad Cars. We ended up with a full tank when we rented the car and had only just finished it when we returned it. They don’t have a policy that you have to refill the gas before returning the car, so that saved us some cash! As for driving the ring road, I feel that there’s no better option than a 4×4 camper van, as I mentioned before. It allowed us to see some waterfalls and explore the highlands that aren’t accessible without a 4×4 car. We also saw the northern lights three out of the seven nights we were camping the ring road, simply because we had flexibility. Plus, we could stop any time we wanted to take photos. Gas is expensive in Iceland as well, but when split between two or even three people, it’s doable. Food is very expensive in Iceland. A basic grocery store sandwich will set you back €9! The cheapest grocery stores are Kronan, Netto, and Bonus. Most of the cheaper stores are closer to Reykjavik, so stock up on imperishables before you leave. A big way that Maksim and I saved money was by cooking everything ourselves in the camper van, which has a sink, stove, and cookware. We never even set food in a restaurant in Iceland. Maybe we missed out, but this was our way of saving money so that we could splurge on other things. Each morning we had meusli and tea, for lunch we had sandwiches that we made ourselves, which made it much cheaper, for snacks we had boiled eggs and cookies and crackers with cream cheese, and for dinner we’d often have sausages and potatoes or pasta with pesto that Maksim brought with him from Germany. As for drinks, the water in Iceland is free and safe to drink as long as it’s the cold water and not the bubbling sulfuric stuff (obviously). If you think you’ll want alcoholic drinks during your trip, make your purchases in duty free before you leave your home or at Reykjavik airport. (Update: You can find liquor outside of the airport but they’re expensive and beer is weak and expensive as well).  If you have an unlocked phone, definitely get a Vodafone SIM card! It only cost me €13 for 3 gigabytes of data which was shockingly good all over the country. Maksim and I didn’t even need to use our GPS because the coverage was so good, we just used Google Maps on our phones to navigate. Maksim and I actually cut our expenses down significantly by traveling during off-peak season. In the spirit of full disclosure, I was also provided a media discount for my 4×4 rental. Regardless, you can expect just about everything, from car and 4×4 rentals, to accommodation, to be about double the price during high season, which is during the summer. Most of the campgrounds are also free during the off season since there’s nobody around to manage them, but they still remain open to discourage back-country camping and off-roading. You also have almost no chance of seeing the northern lights in the summer, which was too important to me to miss. Maksim and I spent €75 each for a whale watching excursion and that was amongst the cheapest tours available in Iceland. If you take tours instead of self-driving, plus pay for accommodation and food in restaurants, you’ll end up spending more than we did by doing things independently. Thankfully the natural attractions don’t have any admissions fees, so once you pay for your transport, food, and accommodation, your major costs are covered, especially if you visit during low season. Could we have spent less? Yes, where there’s a will there’s a way, but our method gave us comfort and ultimate flexibility which was exactly what I wanted for my Iceland adventure. Thanks for the tips! I am trying to plan a fall/winter trip and the campervan seems like the way to go for us. I’m a dude that loves a good shower from time to time. Are there facilities at the campsites and are they available to use outside of summer? There are showers at most of them that are coin operated but I think the cooler way to go, and usually for the same price, is to visit the public bath houses. It’s popular with locals and you get a shower AND a dip in a nice warm pool. More details here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-camping/ great tips and guide! Would love to visit Iceland soon! Alchohol is sold in special alchol stores in Iceland, not in supermarkets, you can buy 5% beer and other strong alchohol in our liqour stores; ATVRYou can find these stores in almost every town, take a look at the locations here http://www.atvr.is But duty free is still much cheaper 😉 yup thats true, but the statement about the percentage in the beer is not true ? It seems like you actually can but it’s just very expensive. Iceland has a history of alcohol prohibition. Yes, a history of alcohol prohibition that ended more than 27 years ago. There’s a liquor store in almost every town, but alcohol is not sold in supermarkets.  The cheapest beer (half a liter in a can) is around $2.30 This is rad Kristin thanks for the tips. And Sad Cars, HA! What a funny name. I’ve always thought it’d be crazy expensive, and even though that’s about x3 more than my normal daily budget, it’d doable especially with another person. And I feel ya about hostels, getting to the point where they are a bit annoying. Thanks for the tips, been following the entire trip and want to go this year. Also, just a heads up, I think the links to the “read more” articles at the bottom are a bit funky. Great post, thanks. I’ve been visiting Iceland in three- to five-day chunks. The country is pretty expensive. It is, but it’s worth it. Hello,  Great post! would you mind telling me what you cost for gas was?  Thank you! It’s a bit cheaper now than it was in years past. I think it was €1.14 per litre Another great, informative post. Iceland has been on my list for a long time. I was going to go this summer but the country went on strike so I had to cancel. I think I want to go during low season like you and see the northern lights while I’m there. I agree about Airbnb. You can find some nice ones there for a pretty low price too! Beautiful photos. Like the light effect on the car and northern lights shot! I read that you purchased the Vodafone SIM Card wtih 3GB data for 13euros! Where’d you get yours from? I checked out the prices on their website online and they’re not that cheap :/ I just walked into a store Reykjavik. This was for just data, no calling or texting. Maybe it’s only a deal in person. Here is the starter kit you likely were able to get: https://vodafone.is/english/get-online/ Hi, Kristin! I’m thinking of driving the Ring Road solo in May and hadn’t considered renting a camper – do you think sleeping in a camper would be safe for a solo female traveller? I’ve traveled Europe alone before but always stayed in hostels. Any thoughts on this? Thanks so much, and I’ve loved reading your Iceland posts. The photos are stunning! (And make me want a new camera haha) Iceland is the safest country in the world according to multiple sources, so I’d personally go for it! Awesome, thanks so much 🙂 Absolutely safe. One of my female friends rented a camper van solo and had zero problems. Damn, the $9 sandwich better taste amazing 😀 Sandwiches are expensive in sandwich shops, but $9 for a sandwich in a grocery store is just not correct.  1000 kr. might be accurate for gas stations and 10/11 maybe, but for normal grocery stores, sandwiches go for around $5 (even cheaper if they’re the store brand). The sandwhich price is exaggerated, last year the general grocery store price was around 4€ and today it’s 6-7€ (price changing due to the strengthening of the Krona, not raised prices locally. I believe the author is going off convenience store prices at best even THEN the price sounds off. It’s what I personally paid for a premade sandwich, so that’s what I’m going on. Glad to hear it’s a bit cheaper now 🙂 This article is a bit misleading… the sad car you took is definitely not a camper and the go campers on the photo is at 249 EUR per day and you DO have to fill it up with gas before you drop it off again… How did you fit that into the 93 USD per day budget? I noted that I had a media discount in the post, and I also noted that the sad car and camper are two seperate things. Not misleading, maybe just misunderstood by you 🙂 You say ” Additionally, with a camper van, you can go anywhere you please and that kind of flexibility allowed us to camp right next to a glacier lagoon, famous waterfalls, and to explore the highlands.” That´s not true, the low in Iceland only allow you to drive on roads and stay over night on a camp side. You can not drive anywhere you like and camp anywhere you like! You can by cheaper alcohol in vine stores “Vínbúð” The glacier lagoon permits camper vans, the campsite was right next to the waterfall, and the 4×4 allowed us to access the highlands. Hello I thought I saw in your posts, a recommendation for a local place to buy traditional sweaters in Reykjavik but now cannot locate it.  Did I imagine it?  If so, any recommendations?  Thanks! That must have been on another site because I didn’t do any shopping there. Sorry! My wife and I are planning a trip in early September for 8 days. Is it necessary to have 4X4 during our visit? Not if you skip the highlands and some of the waterfalls I visited. I noted here where we needed the 4×4: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-itinerary/ Hi there,  I’m travelling to Iceland for 5 days in March. Did your $93 per day budget include your accommodation costs? All of our accom/transport is already booked, so just trying to work out how much spending money to take! Thanks 🙂 I slept in the camper van so yes. Hi there, Great article! Can I ask which month you visited in? I’d love to see the Northern lights but I don’t want to have travel restricted from closed roads… Thanks in advance:) October. Some roads were closed due to flooding, though. Hello! I am wondering how much the cost was to rent the 4×4 camper with your media discount?  I am trying to figure out costs for a fall trip and am wondering how much it will be, I will also be getting a media discount 🙂 thanks so much for your articles. they are wonderful! The cost is exactly what I noted in the post for my share, and I split that with my friend Maksim Hi Kristen, thank you for sharing 🙂 you said you slept in a camper van, where you cold?  If so what kind of gear did you have? My friend and I are going in July and camper van sounds fun. It has a little space heater in it so it was fine! Hey Kristin, Love your blog! I would love to feature a link to this post about Iceland on a new website I am getting ready to launch – would you be interested? You’re welcome to link to me! Hi Kristin, I am a solo female traveler planning on hiring a camper van at the end of October to early November this year. I read some posts on other site and a lot of locals are strongly advising against hiring a camper van (due to strong wind gust it may get tipped over etc.). How was the weather when you were there and did you have any issues with wind? My camper van was a converted SUV so it was fine! Its incredibly windy so it’s more the doors you need to worry about. Hold onto them when you open them! Hi KristinA question on costs if I May? Not counting exchange rate variance and not exactly sure of the type of 4X4 you got (I’ve gone for the cheapest in this instance) the cost of the 4×4 alone is $1940 which divided by 2 is $970. How can the total cost be $937?Thanks I received a media discount for my 4×4 however May might be high season, therefore it is almost double the price, and the prices appear to increase year over year. Nice article.. Can I commute on my own, using public transport incase I don’t hire a camper van. I don’t know driving n I plan to travel solo. How is the connectivity? Also are there hostels across all major tourist attractions? Yes there are hostels, and I am not totally sure about buses since I didn’t take any, but there are definitely tour buses! Hello kristin!Great post I did enjoy all the tips..In fact I’m planning to go next summer to Iceland along with 2 friends (still can’t decide between June, July or september).. we’re mainly interested in hiking and long exposure photography so the idea of a camper van was a great discovery! Well the country is a bit too expensive so please can you estimate what would a 7-9 days trip cost it would help me a lot (camper van for 3 people + gas + food+ whale excursion+ glacier excursion) we might opt for some night stays in hostels too for  good night sleep and bathing.. Many thanks again!Greetings from Lebanon. Hi Firass, I can’t really estimate that for you, but this is supposed to be a guide to help you figure it out. Hope it helps! What time of the year you went?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-golden-circle-self-drive/,How to Spend 48 Hours in Iceland: The Golden Circle and More,Iceland,"These days more and more cheap flights, especially from the East Coast of the US, are offering long layovers in Iceland en route to Europe. If you stumble across one of these fares, you’re in for a real treat. Iceland is a country with so much beautiful scenery, and plenty of it close to Reykjavik, that even with just 48 hours there, you can see tons of awesome stuff and best of all, you can self-drive to maximize the freedom and lower the costs associated with this otherwise expensive country. Iceland’s Golden Circle is drivable in just one day given the driving time is only 3-ish hours. Allow for a full day of exploration, though, starting early in the morning so that you can fully enjoy each stop. Then, save the next day for more lake and geothermal pool exploration just south of Reykjavik. First off, here’s the perfect Golden Circle self-drive itinerary: What I loved about Iceland was that all of the national parks were free. The rumors that Iceland is expensive are true, but at least little things like this don’t set you back any krona. This national park is full of cultural, historical, and natural significance for Iceland. It marks the convergence of the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates and is also where the Icelandic Parliament was established. There are several rift valleys throughout the park, some of which you can dive and snorkel in, with incredibly clear water. Others are full of rocks and beautiful green grasses and red leaves. The area became a World Heritage Site in 2004 and borders Iceland’s largest lake. One could easily spend an entire day just in this park and Maksim, my travel buddy, and I devoted several hours to it. Having fun trying to pronounce these names yet? Here’s an easier one: Geysir. The Strokkur geyser shoots up every 5-6 minutes and the larger one, Geysir, rarely goes off anymore but I sure wish I’d been able to see it! The area was formed by earthquakes and the bubbling, sulfuric pools are simultaneously beautiful, crystal clear, and full of not-so-lovely smelling fumes. If you’ve ever been near an active volcano crater before, you’ll know I’m referring to that rotten egg smell. These geysers and bubbling pools are super cool to see, though, and not far from the next attraction: This is a pretty incredible waterfall, seeming to fall sideways in a staircase fashion into a crevice that is 105 feet (32 meters) deep. It seems to appear out of nowhere and vanish just as quickly. This waterfall is notable not only for its massive size but for the great measures taken to preserve it. The waterfall owner’s daughter, Sigríður Tómasdóttir, is credited as Iceland’s first environmentalist thanks to her determination to preserve the waterfall. When European investors attempted to dam the waterfall to provide power, and profits, she threatened to throw herself into the waterfall. Today, it’s one of Iceland’s most visited sights. Just a note on the crater lake, since Maksim and I decided to skip it (you’ll see why later in this post). The lake is notable for its red rather than black volcanic rock and is only half as old as most of its volcanic surroundings. If you have time, you can make this your last stop on the Golden Circle before making your way back to Reykjavik. The next morning, we decided to head a bit south of Reykjavik and explore an even more spectacular lake en route to yet another geothermal area more popular with hikers. The drive there was a beautiful adventure in itself, full of moss-covered stones and a seriously cool-looking sky: The drive around the lake is beautiful, full of lookout points and places to stop. Maksim and I even saw a couple having their wedding photos taken there, complete with a white gown on the black sand. It was magical (but I didn’t want to take her photo because I wanted to be respectful). This area is full of geothermal fields and bubbling mud pots including the famous Seltún. There were fewer tourists here than at the others geysers mentioned previously and while none of these shot up in the air, if you’re a hiker, you’ll love this spot. The area is also known for its soil, which you can see in the photos. It appears green, red, and yellow in places. It’s also where German scientists proposed a hypothesis on formation of sulphuric acid in nature based on a visit in 1845. Pretty cool stuff! No trip to Iceland is complete without some play time with the furry Icelandic horses, which were developed in Iceland and kept pure thanks to stringent import and export laws. They are small but hearty and rarely suffer from diseases. They’re mainly used for sheep herding and are notable for their thick, soft fur and manes. You’ll see them everywhere as you drive around Iceland. I have to admit, at first I was a little shy about getting close to them but this one really wanted me to pet him, so I obliged. It was a little awkward making friends with someone who has way better hair than I do, but we were able to put our differences aside. Maksim and I ended up here when he stopped by a gravel road and pointed, “There, I want to go down there.” (map) I wouldn’t have even thought of it had he not been so curious, and I’m glad I went along for the ride. This was the only spot during those first two days that we had entirely to ourselves and it was an incredible black sand beach with black stone cliffs that we climbed for at least an hour. It almost looked like a giant bowling ball had carved it out. The Blue Lagoon is best to visit en route back to the airport. It’s on the way, plus you will have the most relaxed flight home after. The water is warmer in some places than others so move around to get the best spot. You can also buy a few drinks for around $8 each, which is about what I’d pay back in Los Angeles, so I didn’t think that was too bad! The lagoon also has clay mud you can rub on your face if you feel like it. Fair warning; I have naturally dry skin and it did dry me out, but most masks tend to. A final lagoon tip: if you want to get your hair in the water, coat it with conditioner first as the sulfuric water can leave it feeling dry and crispy. When you land: Maksim and I booked an airport transfer that got us close to our hotel and on the way back, we included a stop at the Blue Lagoon. Rent: I recommend renting a clunker from Sad Cars because they’re super cheap and you don’t have to return the car filled with gas. We ended up with a full tank when we rented the car and had only just finished it when we returned it. It was awesome! Though you may not have the same luck, the car with all of the insurance was only around €35 each for my travel buddy, Maksim, and me. I don’t have any agenda and get no benefit for mentioning them, I just thought it was a great value. The roads along the Golden Circle are flat and pretty easy to self-drive barring bad weather, so a 4×4 isn’t necessary. Stay: Maksim and I stayed at a wonderful AirBnB rental that was warm, cozy, and well situated. There are tons of them in Reykjavik and apartment rentals (and small guesthouses) remain my favorite way to travel in Europe. If you’re looking for something more romantic, check out these honeymoon in Iceland tips. Great list, Kristin!  This is almost exactly the path I took when I had a rental car (also from Sad Cars which was great) for 48 hours. Starting my trip in Iceland it’s given quite a bit for the rest of my trip to live up to. It’s such an incredible place. Thank you for all the resources! I can’t wait to return and dive between the tectonic plates now that I’m advanced scuba certified! Definitely makes it hard to find a place this varied and beautiful again. It ups the game like crazy for other destinations but i also like that it pushes me to keep exploring more remote, different places. Great post! You mentioned a gravel road to get to Selatangar, but it also sounds like you did not have a 4×4 car is that correct?  Was the gravel road that bad? Would the gravel road be obvious (any landmarks to look for)? Any clarification would be appreciated!  Thanks 🙂 We did have a 4×4 and you can’t take the road unless you have one Hi Kristin, Would you recommend a solo female traveler to do this alone? I am heading there by the end of September and wondering if it is safe enough for me to drive around myself. I am from Southern California with limited experience in driving in the snow. Thanks. You can definitely take day tours if you’re not comfortable with driving in the snow. Otherwise I’d suggest staying at a hostel there and making friends and splitting a car with them. It’ll be easier than you think! Hi. Fantastic information and amazing photography!I am wondering what type of camera you use whilst travelling please? I’ve got all my gear listed here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/gear/ Hi there! Thanks for such good posts on Iceland.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-ring-road-camping/,Camping Iceland’s Ring Road: 24 Things You Need to Know,Iceland,"Iceland is one of the most geographically interesting and naturally stunning countries I’ve ever been to (and I’ve been to a lot!). I had to keep asking myself if we had landed on another planet, because the scenery was, for the most part, unlike anything I had ever seen before. It’s also wild, rugged, and takes a bit more preparation and awareness to drive through should you have interest in taking out a 4×4 and heading off the beaten path a bit (and you should! It’s so worth it!). The following are things I learned and tips to help you on your journey camping Iceland’s ring road: A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Oct 27, 2015 at 3:18am PDT  I get that you can’t always pick when you have time to go somewhere on vacation, but just about everywhere that I can think of is perfect in the Autumn, mainly because the weather is still pleasant and the crowds are much smaller. Plus, changing leaves are drop-dead gorgeous. In Iceland, Autumn is particularly spectacular because the ground also changes color from green to yellows, reds, and oranges. Plus, it’s much more likely to see the Northern Lights since nightfall is around 7pm, which means you get a nice amount of daylight and darkness. In the summer, it’s bright almost all the time and the opposite is true in the winter. Another plus: Iceland’s low season means you can plan on half price for things like camper vans and accommodation. A camper van is, without a doubt, the best way to see and camp around Iceland’s Ring Road and will provide the best opportunities for finding the Northern lights. One night in the highlands, we had no choice but to hole up in the van and pray for the insane wind to stop when we came to a closed road (find road closures here) a few km from the campground. Having a camper van allowed us to cook dinner and sleep soundly (well, as soundly as one can sleep with wind the strength of a jet stream pummeling you) without any problems. The camper van also allowed us to camp and wake up at the glacier lagoon on the third day, as they allow camper vans but not tents in the parking lot. That allowed us to combine the northern lights at night and a sunrise over the lagoon in the morning. It was wonderful having that kind of flexibility and we saved a lot on food and accommodation. The biggest reason to go in the fall is costs. Car and camper rentals in Iceland are easily double the price in the high season months of the summer. We saved half the money by renting in the fall. That, and most of the campgrounds were ‘closed’ but still kept their gates and facilities open since tourism is such big business in Iceland and they want to discourage camping anywhere other than designated spots. That means you can use them for free (seriously). If camping any time other than the summer, rent a camper that has a space heater in the back. It’s separate to the heater in the front that runs off of the engine when the car is on. It uses gasoline, but it’s efficient and I never even noticed a dip in the fuel levels, despite running it all night. The one in my van worked really well, and was a great place to hang things in front of that needed to dry out. Given the first 48 hours of the trip were either rainy or snowy with no break in the precipitation, this was quite handy. A solid week of 24/7 time spent together ain’t easy. Maksim and I are buddies and we were really tested by the initial 48 hours of constant bad weather the first two days, given we barely spent any time outside of the van and if we did, we ended up cold and wet. We were in pretty close quarters that entire time and if we hadn’t been patient with each other, it could have been a nightmare. It’s important to be gentle with each other, be open and honest if something is bothering you (the other person may have no idea!), and to laugh and joke as much as possible. Pick someone you know that’s all possible with. It’s not possible to buy hard liquor at stores in Iceland. If you want anything like that before you go, stash it in your checked baggage, buy it at your departure airport in duty-free, or purchase at the airport in Reykjavik when you land. It’s your only chance. I like my whiskey, so we bought a couple bottles (that we didn’t even finish, actually), at duty-free before going. I never withdrew any money in Iceland because I was able to use my credit card absolutely everywhere. The only places that you might want coins are for laundromats and campsite showers (but more on showers later). I didn’t have a card with a chip at the time, and it presented no issues. Just ask them to swipe it. I rented the GPS but found I never used it. I wanted the power point to charge my other electronics, and most of all, I was downright astounded at how good the coverage from Vodaphone was. Even in the highlands, hours away from any towns, I still had coverage. Any time we needed to figure out where to go, we just used Google Maps. Bonus, this is one of the cheap things in Iceland as 3 gigabytes of 3G was less than USD $15. (You’ll, of course, need an unlocked phone to use a local SIM). I’d read before I left that hot dogs are pretty popular in Iceland. I base myself in Germany for part of the year and it’s a requirement on the visa application that you love sausages, I’m cool with sausage but I also don’t want that or instant noodles for every meal. Even a pre-made sandwich at the grocery store will cost around $8. It’s much better to buy individual ingredients and cook or make sandwiches yourself. It takes a little bit of extra time but chances are you’ll already be parked for the night anyways or can spare 5 minutes to make a sandwich. Camper vans are equipped with a sink and running water that is easy to refill, a camp stove that runs off of propane, and cooking utensils. Easy peasy. Maksim and I learned the hard way that those nifty budget grocery stores (Bónus, Krónan, and Netto) that are a dime a dozen in Reykjavik were a lot harder to find once already on the ring road. Stock up on things that won’t go bad easily, such as pasta, potatoes, and cereals. They’ll increase in price if you have to buy at the smaller, more expensive stores. Tip: There is a Netto in Egilsstaðir in the Eastern Fjords. I actually never set foot in a restaurant in Iceland. I knew they were expensive and since we had a well-equipped camper van, cooking was the best bet. There was a system we implemented early on in the Ring Road to make things easier and to preserve and re-use ingredients before they went bad. It worked pretty well: Mornings: Muesli (or whatever cereal you like) and hot tea. Lunch: Soft-boiled eggs as snacks boiled the night before in the leftover pasta or potato water and sandwiches with tomato, thinly-sliced cucumber (one cucumber lasts forever but lettuce won’t), a mix of ham and salami, and some amazing sauce of the gods called Remoulade. Seriously that stuff is good. We resolved to keep eating sandwiches until we got tired of them, which, after a week, we never did. Dinner: Wither pasta with chopped peppers and pesto sauce (we had four kinds that Maksim brought from Germany), or boiled sausages with potatoes. I also boiled frozen veggies with my meals. Unless the weather is nice enough to cook outside, boil what you eat when cooking indoors or you’ll have an oily mess to deal with after and your clothes will smell like sausage. Snacks: A ridiculous amount of boiled eggs, crackers with cream cheese, and cookies. We really like cookies. It’s tough to know when you’ll come across another gas station, so when it gets to a half tank, start thinking about filling up, especially in the Eastern Fjords. We never even got close to running out, but better safe than sorry. Iceland has no shortage of water, and you can pretty much always find it for free at gas stations. There’s usually a hose around that you can use to fill up water bottles and the water tank in your camper van. If you are taking a lot of 4×4 roads and need to give the car a shower, you can do that for free, too! There are usually also hoses with large brushes attached just for that purpose. I’m glad you asked, because it’s actually pretty neat to check out Iceland’s public swimming pools that cost anywhere from 350-600kr (USD $2.75 – 5.75) for a shower and a dip in the heated pools. They are super popular with locals and seem to be in just about every town and village, no matter how small. You can also shower at the campsites if they’re open. The prices run about the same and you’ll need coins and will get just a few minutes. You can take as long as you want at the swimming pools. Find locations and hours of operation here. I preach to always have a pack towel in my packing guides but somehow completely forgot to bring one to Iceland. Major fail. I spent around 600 kronar, per shower, to rent one. If you’re wondering why I didn’t just buy one, I found they ran around 2200 kronar. It would have evened out eventually but I’ll let you do the math on why I didn’t buy one (#noshame). I didn’t believe it at first when we picked up the van and the girl at the shop told us to hold onto the door in windy weather. Why? It can blow right off the hinges – the wind in Iceland is that strong! One of the doors on our vehicle almost did blow clear off, and had to be fixed after, which brings me to the next point: Driving the ring road for a week or more means you’ll encounter all kinds of weather and road conditions that you might not have expected. I had no idea before we started how real the weather was going to be. Sand storms can happen, as can hail, insane wind, and all kinds of gravel marks, especially if you take a 4×4 road. Insure your rental fully, except for theft insurance since nobody steals cars in Iceland. Honestly, people even leave them running when they go to the grocery store! You should also make sure that you have travel insurance for yourself, just in case you get sick or need to go home early for medical reasons. The best case scenario is that you don’t need it but it will keep you covered in the worst-case scenario. Chances are good that at some point in Iceland you’ll encounter rain, and when it rains in Iceland, it rains. I was really glad to have waterproof boots with me. It was also a good idea to have two pairs, because during one of our hikes I had to jump across about 20 freezing streams of water and, despite those years doing high jump in high school, couldn’t quite clear it and ended up dunking my leg up to my knee. Maksim suffered the same fate but he only had one pair of shoes. Mine are Ugg brand and you can similar ones here and here. Check out this post for my full Iceland packing list.   I travel with a portable charger that holds four charges in it. It was super helpful to have that along considering my phone served as a GPS and I was using it for work as well (Snapchat, Instagram, emails, etc.), plus, my new camera needs to be charged more often than my old one did, and I have a GoPro, plus, Maksim wanted to charge his stuff too. In our van there was only one power outlet, which I think is probably standard, so it was a great idea to have another method for charging available. Iceland’s Ring Road drive had long been on my list because I wanted to photograph the heck out of it. I was really hoping to catch the Northern Lights and was able to find them three times because before setting off on the trip, we looked at the weather and aurora forecast and headed south rather than north on the chance that we’d get clear skies mid-week. It paid off! I knew that I needed certain equipment for photographing them, such as a tripod and a remote, and thankfully neither were expensive. I was also able to get some neat long exposure shots of all the waterfalls with those two items, as well as a CPL filter. Check out my Iceland photography tips for more on how to photograph the Northern Lights and waterfalls. After my last phone succumbed to the elements, I decided I wasn’t going to let that happen again and before going to Iceland, I bought a LifeProof case that would protect it even from freezing temperatures. I used to dislike similar cases because they’re so bulky, but this one is much sleeker and totally worked. I took it out in the rain, under the water in the blue lagoon, close to waterfalls, and in the snow and it protected me the whole time. I felt that it was definitely worth the cost of the case to protect my $900 phone. Plus, I can take my phone in the shower now to play music. Win! Sheep will just run right out in front of you without even thinking about it. Probably because they don’t think much? It’s difficult to know what’s going through their little sheep brains when they dart across the roads but they sure are cute and it’s hilarious to watch them running. It’s just not so hilarious to hit one. Keep your eyes open for them, especially when driving at night. On day one we declared the back of the van, where we slept and ate, a no-shoe zone. That was our saving grace as far as keeping it clean. The shoes and bags sat in the front seat while we slept so that we had ample space and clean digs. It’s really tempting to just stop in the road and take a quick photo when driving the ring road, but I noticed that there were always places to pull over and get out of the car. We always found an option, and it was frustrating when others just stopped in the road for long periods of time for photos. Be kind to those around you and just pull off the road in a clear spot where it’s ok to do so. It’s dangerous to park in the road and parking spots are never too far. There you go! 24 easy and quick tips to help make your Iceland Ring Road trip an awesome experience. Have any questions? Feel free to ask in the comments and I’ll be sure to get back to you. *GoCampers provided me with a discount on the camper van for my ring road trip. My review is favorable because I think the van was a GREAT asset for our trip. I definitely recommend this company and would have without the discount as well. I’ve never commented before, but decided I should start 🙂 So omg thank you this is the Iceland post I’ve been looking for! I’m planning to go to Iceland sometime in the next year or two and have been looking for literally this exact information That’s awesome! There’s a packing list coming as well and some golden circle info, so you should be covered 🙂 Great tips! I’ve only been to Iceland in the winter so far, and have yet to rent a car/camper because I know how crazy the winter weather can somehow get. But going in the fall sounds perfect! I will definitely keep this in mind for when I plan my next trip to Iceland! I wouldn’t have wanted to drive a car around there in the winter, but then again I have zero experience with that and would find it terrifying. I was glad Maksim was driving! I’ve finally decided to head to Iceland in late October later this year after wanting to vista for years and years so thank you so much for this awesome, helpful post Kristin!! Next stop, your post on ‘Iceland Photography Tips’ 🙂 Awesome! The packing post is coming this week too! Great advice and inghits as aways.  Wonderful shot of Kirkjufellsfoss! Was this with your Sony a6000 camera? Can I ask switch shutter speed you used for that particular shot? I have the same camera. Happy travels! Hi Jenna. I think it was a second or a fraction of a second and yes that was with my Sony a6000 This definitely looks like the way to go to see a lot of the country. Did you research and plan out your campsites in advance or did you just wing it while you were there? Are you going to write anything about the financial details of your trip to Iceland? I’ve heard it can be quite pricey, but since you’re so good with your travel money management, I’m curious 🙂 Completely winged it and yes I’ll write about the budget. It’s not a cheap destination at all but certain things can be cheap if you play your cards right which I’ll explain 🙂 I wish I would have had this list before my trip! I had to learn about filling up on gas often and bringing backup chargers the hard way. It’s pretty crazy when you’re driving, especially when you’re solo. I completely agree with the bring your own towel, stock up on cheap local food and get the insurance. Valuable information. Great photos as always! Thanks Cam! Luckily I read up on expertvagabond.com before I went and he had a lot of good suggestions about all of that. This was extremely helpful, there is so much more for me to think about than I first realised! I’m planning a trip to Iceland this October. I have 2 questions for you! 1. Would many of the places you visited be inaccessible if we only had a non-4×4 camper van?2. Did you buy your Vodafone card in Iceland? Thank you! 1. Yes, namely the highlands and one of the better waterfalls we saw2. Yes, in Reykjavik it’s easy there are lots of shops around Hi there, good information, and happy to see people share advice on traveling in Iceland. I would like to add one warning, to those of you who are going to come to Iceland: No matter how beautiful the scenery is and you want to take a picture instantly, DO NOT STOP YOUR CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD BUT TAKE IT ASIDE AS POSSIBLE so that passing cars can pass you without danger. this comment is based on experience driving in my country as a native experiencing increasing tourism.  And do not drive off road, no matter if on 4×4 wheel or not. Just follow roads and gravel roads outside the main road  but do not leave the road. It is forbidden for the sake of nature protection and you can get a huge fine, and it hurts us natives if people vandalize your country by leaving scars in nature after car wheels.  and a tip. There is this Bonus and Netto  supermarkets in the biggest towns around the ring road nr. 1 and the price in Bonus is the same in the Bonus stores outside Reykjavík Wish you all who come to Iceland the best of luck.  And thank you Kristin for warning about the sheep on the road. To many people have gotten seriously injured or even died when crashing into sheep on the road in Iceland. Yep, my points too. Don’t just stop in the middle of the road. Unfortunately a lot of people do! Hi, glad you enjoyed it. However there are shops selling hard liquor and beer in almost every village, just the opening hours are not long. Also there is both a Bónus and a Nettó in Egilsstaðir and in Reyðarfjörður next door there’s Krónan.Happy Travels. Good to know. My friend told me before I went that it wasn’t to be found ‘anywhere’ but I guess it’s maybe just a bit more expensive. Hi  Kristin, I am helping with a geology field trip to Iceland from May 24 to June 5.  We will have a total of 12 individuals in our group and will be mixing it up with camping for a few days and then a night or two in a hostel.  As the tech for the SLU geology department i will be helping one of our professor who is leading the trip.  My biggest responsibilities are usually first aid and the purchase of the groceries and the preparations of meals for the group, mainly breakfast and dinner while the group will make their own sandwiches for their lunches after breakfast is finished.  I am hoping to buy some food items in bulk at one of the large stores, though I am not sure what is available in Iceland for groceries, particularly in large packages.  Things like large bags of pancake mix, gallon carton of instant hash browns, canned goods to prepare meals with, hamburger, hot dogs or sausage, canned or frozen vegetables, etc…  Which brings me to my other big concern…  We hope to bring a two burner Coleman stove that takes the green Coleman canisters.  Are the green Coleman fuel canisters available in Iceland?  Do they hook up to a Coleman stove from the states or is it different?I have done this sort of work many times before, but in Alaska and the Northern Rockies were we were able to purchase in bulk and were able to purchase the Coleman Stove canisters.  Any insight on the purchase of groceries for a group and the availability of Coleman fuel canisters would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks too for the advice you have given and i am happy to be the muse and learn.  CheersMatt I had a stove with my camper van but I can’t remember the brand. It’s the same kind I would use at home with a stove. If you go to the big department stores you can buy the things you need though I wasn’t looking for bulk items so I can’t say for sure what the sizes are. Buy in Reykjavik, it’s your best chance. Really nice i can wonder about going to Iceland now but in next year probably i can go there from that reason i will use some of your tips for sure :] How much cash did you have on hand? Which did you use more often, cash or card? I never took Krona out of the ATM actually. Never needed it and I have a card that doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees (important!) so it was advantageous for me to use that for the mileage rewards. Question: did you bring a cooler with you for all your food? The camper van has one built in. May I know how much cost per person overnight in campsite per day? It was free for me because there was nobody there to collect any money, so I don’t know! That won’t be the case during high season I said people need to use campsites, and that they were open and free when I was there in October. They aren’t always, and you can’t camp anywhere you please. I think I was pretty clear about that but thank you for sharing this article 🙂 We’ll soon be off to Iceland, and are doing some research on how to make the best camping trip. This is was very helpful! Thank you 🙂 Hi there! I love this blog! It has been very helpful in planning our trip at the beginning of October. What dates were you there? I am just concerned that being there Oct 2-12 we may have trouble finding campgrounds open/ with bathroom facilities available. Did you run into any of this trouble or was it fairly easy winging it and finding places? Thanks! I was there from Oct 1-10. The campgrounds stay open! You can buy liquor at the state run liquor stores…I saw one in Reykjavik and one in Hofn…Would assume Akeuryi and Selfoss have them as well. A travel tip I would add is to never use the “fill up” option when pumping gas. It’ll put a 200 dollar hold on your account for 48-72 hours until the amount that was actually pumped clears. i didn’t see this in any book or forum before my trip. Would have been great to know. I think this is actually common worldwide at gas stations. Hi Kristin,Thanks for the nice blog article and great tips! I’m heading out to do a loop in Iceland in a few weeks (same time as yours). If the volcano stays calm, we’ll be traveling on a motorhome / RV for 4ppl. Given everyone will have at least 2-3 devices (phone, camera, tablet, etc) to charge nowadays, my biggest concern is to figure out our charging options. I plan to bring an extension cord, but am wondering if it was hard to find power outlets during your trip? Did your camper come with a 3-prong plug/adapter for your devices? Does the campground offer power outlets even if it is closed? My pack alone will have 2 a6000, 2 GoPro, phone, tablet, and a phantom.Any particular campground you really like?Thanks! I found a power outlet once at one of the campgrounds. I wasn’t looking that often. However your RV should have outlets.The best thing you can do is bring along portable powerpacks. I swear by mine. What a cool adventure to have at such an impressionable age for your toddler. That sounds so amazing! Love this article, it definitely inspire us to go to Iceland! We are planning to go in one month and as we miss our “van life” like that onces we had in Australia and New Zealand, we would like to have another roadtrip adventure! I have a technical question about the 4×4 campervan that you rented. Has the weather will be a nightmare on October,  is it possible to properly cook inside? I mean turn on the camp stove inside the back of the car like on a motorhome? Or you have to stay outside? And is mandatory a 4×4 or you are ok with a normal 2×2 campervan as well? Thank you! We cooked inside but instead of frying we boiled and were sure to crack the windows. Take a look at the itinerary as well and you’ll see what we needed the 4×4 for. You’d miss the highlands and one of the waterfalls, both of which were super cool. Just back from Iceland and I have to say that your tips about the country were great! Just a note, in Iceland you can buy wine or liquor in Vinbudin in small cities also, no only at the airport. Prices are pretty much the same. It’s closed on Sunday. Thanks for the tip! Hi there, Just wondering if you think it’s safe enough to drive around Iceland on your own? I’ll be doing a tour through the Highlands but will hire a car to drive around the Ring Road and have planned it all down to the T.Your posts have been super helpful thank you, and I can’t wait to get over there. Claire Hi Claire – Iceland is the safest country in the world. People leave their cars running when they pop into the grocery store. I do know some people who have done it solo and honestly I would have too if my friend hadn’t been with me. However I don’t feel qualified or comfortable with telling you that yes, it’s totally fine and that you should do it. I can just tell you that I probably would and that people often do. Your call 🙂 Hi Kristin,how safety is to go solo …girl solo?Thank you Ana I didn’t do it solo but Iceland is a safe country, it’s just how you feel driving alone and that’s up to you! Wow! It looks like you had a great time. All of your photos are stunning. It’s neat the locals visit the pools, too! Thanks for sharing all of these great tips. Hello, I love your posts concerning your iceland road trips. I am going this mid December and I’ve rented a camper van as well. However, I hope to have more information on campsites. May I know the names of the campsites that you’ve stayed overnight at? I know they are closed, but were there any shower facilities that are opened? I know that the most convenient thing to do is to take a shower at the public pools, but as I googled them, I find out that we need to shower in complete naked in front of others, and this idea makes me want to avoid the public pools. Please advice.  Thanks. The showers were half open and half not. You’d need coins to operate them. Most of the time at the pools nobody else was in there when I was showering naked and the men’s and women’s restrooms are separated so you would only be naked with other women. There’s nothing to worry about! I don’t have the names of the sites I just have the stops. There was one campsite at each place that you couldn’t possibly miss. Hi. We’re planning a motorhome trip around Iceland in July 2017. Can you tell me if (once out of Reykjavik) it’s possible to simply park at the side of the road overnight. I will obviously look for suitable places off the road’s edge, but are car park near waterfalls and into the interior simply free to park up overnight in? Thanks You are supposed to pull into campgrounds to park overnight. I need to take portable propane heater with myself on the Iceland or no need it here? The camper van comes with a stove Hi Kristin,Amazing info! My husband and I have decided to go to Iceland in October because of this article! We have never been before and are planning on hiring a 4×4 camper to travel the ring road. However I have looked on a few websites like tripadvisor and they say that all of the campgrounds are closed and that the facilities such a toilets and showers are shut and locked I’m just wondering if this is correct and if you could give us any advice?Thanks heaps!Ashleigh I found them to be unlocked but can’t say for sure what will happen when you go. They want to discourage back country camping so I think that’s why they were open. Closed??    All of the campgrounds would be closed at this time of year in Winter….   but I can’t imagine they would not be open in summer.   Surely what you read just meant they are closed right now for winter. I was still able to use them even though they were “closed” the parking lots were still open and the bathrooms too. Hi Kristin,    I just spoke to one of the GoCamper people and looking for September pricing on one of their 2×4 automatic campers.  He said it was their “shoulder” season and that they have  a 15% discount.  Quoted me a price of $149. us /day. Does this sound reasonable?  You had mentioned on your webpage there might be half pricing so I just wondered what your experience was and whether other vendors might have different pricing. Also looking at what I might miss by not being able to travel the F tracks without a 4×4. He mentioned the West Fjords might be difficult to access without the 4×4. I’ll be there for two weeks in September with maybe a 2-3 day stay in Reykyavik to begin with.Thanks for any suggestions,  Kim It’s probably reasonable, and when I say half pricing I should clarify that other things that are normally expensive, like campgrounds, are actually more like free. The natural attractions are free too for the most part. You’d want the 4×4 for the West Fjords but that also probably means you wouldn’t really be doing the ring road. I was there for 10 days and barely finished it in time. Oh My Gosh! I LOVE your blog!  Your writing is amazing!  Great Job!  Keep it up! I’m headed to Iceland in a week and I found your blog to be the realist.  Very authentic and covering basis.  Plus, your perspective is from your experience and it doesn’t feel like you’re trying to potentially sell my a tour (ha!) Thank you for you! No tour to sell, this is all self-drive 🙂 Enjoy Icleand! Just returned from Iceland a couple days ago and while we were there enjoying guided tours we started talking about going back in warmer weather and camping along the Ring Road.  I’m so excited to have found your tips!  Thank you!  I’m also looking forward to reading about more of your travels. Have an amazing time! Iceland is a awesome country for camping and hiking. Really good information on the trip.  Would love to recommend this to any backpacker who want to be a part of nature. Having the right gear and tools for your trip is only part of preparing for your camping trip. There are other skills which need to be mastered also. Thank you for sharing this and please keep it up Hi, this post is very helpful! We are looking to rent a camper van and going the third week in May, just before busy season. It looks like some campgrounds will be open and some won’t be yet. I have seen a few things about about a camping card – would you recommend it? I haven’t heard of that but even though they were ‘closed’ when I was there they were still open. Hi! Thanks for your super informative post! My boyfriend and I are looking to go in March and are planning on camping – we have plenty of solid winter camping stuff and have camped in subzero, windy temps before. Although I’m seeing a lot of stuff out there about high winds in Iceland in the winter, we’re up to the challenge!! Do you know if these closed sites will have open gates in mid-late March as well? We were hoping to camp at the sites instead of just off the side of the road, if possible. If you have any info or can direct me to someone who might, I’d really appreciate it! Thanks! Kelsey I don’t think you’re allowed to camp on the side of the road. They really try to discourage that, so they should be open though I can’t say that 100% for sure!  As for wind, I had some gnarly winds in Patagonia and the best thing you can do is get extra ropes and tie them to rocks and get the tent nice and surrounded in low areas. Of course, if it rains you’re in an ideal spot for the rain to collect, so try to find one where the water has somewhere to go 🙂 I’ve starting to plan my solo trip (67 year old woman) to Iceland and was going to do a short jaunt on the way to Europe…..but now I’m changing it up to 10 days, only Iceland, in a camper van and going whole hog! I’m so glad I found your site, you inspired me. Also, I thing I’ll go in Oct instead of Sept like I had been planning to. So whats the worse that can happen  Thank you!! That’s awesome Cindy! Let me know how it goes for you! I’m sure it’ll be amazing. Hello, I admit that I didn’t read ALL the comments, but I don’t believe you spoke to this: I understand that now that Iceland tourism/campervanning is popular, it is very much preferred to stay in campsites (‘official’ campsites?). Do you think this decreases the ‘coolness’ of renting a van and being able to wake up close to the geographical features that make Iceland great? What I mean is, is having a campervan to park in the campsites better, due to the sights, than staying at a hotel/b&b? Thanks for any thoughts! I personally really liked the flexibility that it gave me, but it’s going to be less comfortable, naturally, than staying in a hotel. Your call! Thanks for all the advice! We used KUKU campers to rent our campervan and ABSOLUTELY LOVED our experience. We opted for the one that’s slightly bigger than the one you guys used and it was way more room than 2 people could possibly need. Thanks so much for all the tips 🙂  HelloThank you so much for your post.  Me husband, toddler and I will be travelling in mid-march and keep going back and forth from the camper rental to a car with air bnbs. I don’t feel like planning out my trip ahead of time (I don’t feel like I have a grasp of where to go exactly) so booking accommodations is hard.  We have 6 days to travel.  I was set on a camper van but my main concern was the sparse winter camping sites.  Where do you park in the city? Is there anyway to know if the gates are still open in March for the “closed” campsites ? Thank you so much ! I believe they keep the gates open but the best bet would be to ask the camper van company Hello, I really need help about where to sleep.I’m planning to rent a campervan. Do we only sleep at campsites? Because for now I really thought we can only sleep at the campsites.Or what did you do before? As I read, you once slept in the parking area of glacier lagoon.How about the fee? If at campsites.Did you check where to sleep before the trip or you guys just stop at random places? Thanks a lot You are not allowed to pull off the side of the road to camp but the campsites were open when I was there, but not fully, so they weren’t charging or run by anyone. The glacier lagoon allows you to camp in their parking lot. We are arriving in Iceland on March 29th until April 5th. Renting a camper van. Do you have a site or any advice on where we are allowed to park or camp? We dont want to be those people  thanks in advance Yes, In campsites! Also, when I wanted to pull over for a view, there was almost always a little place to pull out within a few minutes or less.  How did you dry your hair after showering or bathing? I imagine with the cold you’d want to dry your hair instead of walking around with it wet. Do the pools or bathing stations have them provided? Did you bring your own and plug it into the camper? They had hair dryers! Thank you so much for writing this article. One of the best and more helpful ones for sure. We’re heading to Iceland soon and are planning our trip right off your writing. Thanks so much!!!! You’re welcome! Glad you found it helpful! Hi Kristin, No matter what I punch into google in regards to a trip my partner and I are doing around Iceland this coming Winter, your blog keeps coming up. Great work!!! So much useful information, especially about the camp grounds being open, and the weather conditions.  Thanks so much!!! That’s awesome! Glad you have found it all to be helpful! I am happy that I found your blog! Very interesting 🙂 It helped me a lot for planning my trip.But I have a question.I want to rent a “normal” car…not a camping van. Are we still allowed to have a sleep-over on a parking lot? In some yes and in some no. You’ll need to have a tent and a place to put it This was so informative and enjoyable to read. Thank you very much! Myself and my other half are doing 3 weeks in Iceland in July/August and will be taking a lot of what you said on board. Can’t wait to read some more. Wow I’m jealous you’re going for so long! It’s definitely better enjoyed with more time than less 🙂 Hello Kristin, I have read most of your comments, noticed one saying that we could rent a normal car and stay at the campgrounds provided we have a tent and a place where to put it. I was hoping to rent a 4×4 SUV car where me and my girlfriend could sleep over, like when folding down the seats, should be enough space for us, as I found out. Could you please tell me whether there might be any problems with the law or possibility of getting a fine for not having a proper camper van and sleeping in a normal car? I understand it is less comfortable etc. But we could surely save up lots of money and spend them on something else. Thanks a lot, amazing job with the article. And thanks for keeping it up-to-date for new tourists like us. Hi Stepan, Hm, I’m not the person to consult on Icelandic law, but I can tell you I never saw any police there.  If you do see them, get a selfie. They seem like a lot of fun https://www.instagram.com/logreglan/ Dude, that sheep is totally photoshopped Hi Kristin, great post! I am planning a ring road trip in October as well – possible first 2 weeks. I see that your post is very positive about campgrounds remaining open, but other places have been warning my troop and I away from even entertaining such thoughts. But I will take your word for it 😀 Just to be sure, when you say the campgrounds are open – does this include the facilities as well (aka the water, toilets, bath etc.)?  Thanks! Sometimes it did include the facilities. I hope you’ll let us know what you find! I had no problems. Great blog, Thanks a lot HI Kristin,  I saw that you said you went in Autumn and was wondering what month you were there?  Your blog is what actually got me to book my solo trip to Iceland from 9/22/17 for 1.5 weeks and I plan on renting a camper van and just travel on the ring road!  Just wondering if your trip was around that time and how the weather was…I know there are strong winds that can blow campers over.  Did you experience anything close to that?  Got a little scared from some Tripadvisor threads absolutely discouraging camper vans on the ring road from September on, so wanted to get your thoughts.  Thanks so much! I went during the first week of October, from the 1-11, so the timing sounds good. The wind is insane so hold onto your door when you open it! I didn’t experience weather so extreme that it would blow over a camper, though. Kristin: Thanks for the article. I’ve secured my trip (flight to KEF) for 6 days the hop over to BCN for Transatlantic. I have a lot of camping gear from my travels on the Appalachian Trail, and was thinking of renting a car instead of a campervan. It’s just me, so your insights are appreciated. BTW, what are the prices of a campervan in late October (27 October – 2 November)? Any company you recommend?  Stuart I used GoCampers and the prices probably fluctuate so I’d check with them! You don’t need a tent or gear if you get a camper van. I know it was mentioned before but you can buy liquor in government liquor stores. It’s the same in Canada, but yes you cannot get it in grocery stores.  A bottle of red wine will run around $20-25 USD and a 1lter bottle of absolute will be around $63.00 USD.  Good Evening Kristin: Impressive article and blog~! I’m heading to KEF on 26 October from Orlando, FL on a stopover for 6 days, and your article is just what I needed – straight answers. I’m solo and like a previous poster, also renting a 4X4 SUV so I can camp out of it. I have gear from my AT days with an MSR clean fuel stove, and gear that should keep me warm. I’m also bringing supplies. I have 6 days to tour, so I’m hoping you can answer a couple of questions – what area should I definitely hit in those six days and with only 6 days should I forego a 4X4 and the F-Roads? A little bit about me: I’m an adventurer, and although I’m a native Floridian, I enjoy the cold weather. Kristin, thank you for the article and thank you for your reply. Stuart Hey! Six days is short for the ring road – you’d really have to push it and miss a lot and I guess in that case I’d skip the F roads since they are slow-going. Alternatively make your way to the southern part and explore that area since it’s so beautiful and with so much to see, or head to the Western Fjords with a 4×4 for something that’s more off the beaten path. That’s next on my list! Hello, I intend to take my own motorhome (in 2018) from Ireland overland to Denmark and go by ferry as part of the adventure. I intend travelling in June and my question is would one have to pre-book camping sites at that time of the year. There seems to be no centralised campsite website that you can search by facilities/length of motor home/electric hook up etc. I used ACSI card in France last year and it has an accompanying APP for searching. I used this site to find camping spots: https://en.camping.info/iceland/campsitesSince I can’t answer your question from personal experience I suggest contacting one of the campsite managers to ask them. They can help out more! Kristin, thanks for sharing.  The pictures are beautiful.  You recommended to travel in the Fall.  Exactly when would be the peak time for all the Autumn landscape colors?  I plan to be there on October 10, so I hope I can catch some of those amazing autumn landscapes. That really depends on the year. I was there October 1-11. Wow! This is what I am looking for. A blog with all the info I want to know about roadtrip in Iceland.Will be going there next year with a friend. Probably around Aug or Sept. hope that would be the a good month. I wanna see the Northern Lights and he wants less tourists so we decided to go during Fall season. He wants to camp like the way you did but im anxious to do that coz it would be my first time to camp if ever. so we decided to just rent a 4wd and just camp outside in a tent for just a night or two. Can you suggest a nice place to camp outside? Just for experience.Will definitely come back in here to ask some more info. I hope you dont mind.Thanks for this wonderful post. Will share it to my travel buddy.Of all the tips, this is my favorite:“Pick someone you <3 to go with and be gentle with each other""I hope this trip would be a trip to remember for both of us. The campsites are the best place where you can camp, however you’ll need some good cold weather sleeping bags and gear! It’s cold in Iceland, especially if you want to go during a time that you can see the Northern lights. Hi Kristin,  Thank God I found your blog, your information about Iceland is pretty impressive.I am planning to go to Iceland next year, so this post help me a lot. Thank you! =) And also, your photos are stunning! I want to experience the yellow of fall like you did. Just wondering what month did you go there? I am thinking to go on October but a bit doubt because I read some other blogs say that October may be snowing. Should I go on September instead? Oh, one last question! If we rent campervan, where should we go if we need restroom some time? Is campsite provide it? I went October 1-10 🙂I did have snow but only in the highlands. Each year is different of course, but I thought October was perfect.Campsites have restrooms. If I just had to emergency pee we pulled over and I had a bag in the car I put the used toilet paper in. I am going to Iceland next week!! So this article was very welcome. We (my boyfriend and I) have rented a campervan and were planning on driving ring road. However, since doing our researc, we have a lot of urging against driving the ring road in winter time (when we will be there) and now my boyfriend is thinking we should change our plans. I wanted to see if anyone here had driven ring road in a camper and could share a little about your experiences? I don’t want to get ourselves into a sticky situation but I also don’t want to miss out. Any help is most welcome! Hi Kristin! My sister, best friend and I are going to Iceland Sept 29 – Oct 10, and are renting a camper. But we’re having trouble figuring out which type of camper would be best for us. We’re thinking a three-person van might get a little cramped after 10 days, but a lot of the 4/5 person automatic campers (none of us can drive stick) that we’re finding don’t have a sink in them; how necessary do you think it is for us to have one? I know campsites have sinks we can use, but is it worth trying to find one that has a sink in it? Also, if we wanted to venture off the ring road, say near Gullfoss or Kirkjufell, should we get a 4×4? Thanks! You’ll want a 4×4 if you head to the highlands, or anywhere else I listed on there. I think for Gulfoss and Krikjufell you don’t need a 4×4. Yes it would be cramped after a while so you might want to go a little bigger for your sanity! I guess a sink isn’t super important. Just save your dishes and wash at the campsites. Hello! Thank you for your wonderful blog !  I’m going to Iceland Mar 1 -10, 2018 and traveling solo in a camper van (Cozy Camper). I’m traveling around Ring Road and most of the campsites say that they’re open year round so I can be assured of toilets/ showers, but the one in Vik doesn’t say it’s open year round and their email bounced back.  Do you recall if they were open if you went there?  My friend who did this in Oct a few years ago said most places were open and not locked, even if there was no attendant avail. Also I just noticed Blue Lagoon is expensive!  $61 USD just to get in the door for the basic package.  That’s a lot of money. Are the other geothermal pools around the country that expensive?  I’m hoping to find them and enjoy them on this trip!   Thank you again, your blog was most helpful as I am doing this trek around Iceland to celebrate my 50th and my friend said the country is so safe and the people are great. She said the weather is a doozy, so you are my hero for TENT camping. haha –  My friend rented the Cozy Camper and had such a great experience so that’s why I am renting it.    Thank you! I found the same when I went in October. Most were open but not locked. In most cases regarding showers, we went to the thermal baths which seem to be in each town, even the tiny ones. So to answer two of your questions, you can bathe along the way, no problem and yes there are many alternatives to the blue lagoon, they just aren’t blue. Bring your own towel! Happy birthday! Yes Iceland is super safe. I didn’t tent camp, I also did a camper van. Was a great idea 🙂 Hey Kristin,  First of all, thank you for this awesome article! 🙂 I truly loved it! We 2 are planning to rent a 4×4 campervan for our 10 day, RingRoads trip to Iceland this September. Do you think that showers and toilets will be open during our visit? (We travel on a budget, so do not want to pay extra money for taking a shower etc.) My other question is if is there any car rentals that you recommend?  Thanks a lot in advance, your blog was extremely inspiring! 🙂 Hey! I would recommend the camper van listed in the post near the top. There were showers open at some campsites and not others when I went in October, but they were all pay-to-use. The public baths is part of the experience, though, so I’d recommend budgeting it in! Thank you so much! This has been very helpful! Thinking of visiting Iceland this August.  Your article answered many questions! Any you are funny! 🙂 I will use your packing list to the T Awesome have fun! your post is just awesome just need to know that i will be travelling with my wife in this october and need to know how ere the campsites in iceland and if therz a situation can i rent a room in campsites If you want rooms better book those ahead of time. Campsites are in each little town for the most part and on the website I linked 🙂 How much money did you spend on gas? Thing is the price fluctuates a lot so what I spent won’t be a good indicator of what it might cost now. I don’t think it was more than $100 each, though. Hi Kristin, I came across your blog this morning while attempting to plan a trip with my friend around Iceland in June.  I found it super helpful ! We are both avid campers and want to ideally camp around the island, but are unsure of the best routes and realistic possibilities in our 5 day trip.   If you had a moment to answer some questions about your trip and other options of seeing the island, I would really appreciate it.  Thank you and I look forward to your response! I’d head south in that case! Hi Kristin, Great article!  Definitely planning on using a lot of your tips and visiting the places you’ve recommended.  Had a question on camping… We were thinking of bringing our own tent/gear and simply renting a 4×4 so we could access the areas we would like.  We will be there early/mid September.  Did you always camp at campgrounds or just find a nice secluded area to call it a night? You’re required to camp in campgrounds as far as I understand. I think most 4x4s are equipped with tents or are camper vans, which makes it a lot easier and warmer! oh, i love Camping. You can enjoy the pure nature and just switch off…  About how much USD did the camper van cost to rent per night? Also month did you go? October! I have the campervan I used linked in the post. It was expensive but it also totally depends on what time of year you go. Great post! I’m planning a trip to Iceland for this summer and plan on renting a camper van. I’ve been doing research on campsites to stay at, but I haven’t seen anything about whether you need to reserve a campsite in advance. Did you need to reserve any campsites or was first come first serve? Since I’ll be visiting in the busy season I’m a little worried it may be difficult finding places to camp. I appreciate your help! I was there in low season so they weren’t even staffed. I think reserving ahead of time could be a good idea. I’d contact them directly to try to find out. Hi, great blog! I loved it! I´m thinking about a road trip to Iceland, but I only have a few days in early april, do you know if we go on a roadtrip with the van, I can find campistes to pass the night? I read some other sites that say in april almost all campsites are colsed. Thank you in adavanceKind Regards Monts (Form Mexico 🙂 ) I think they’re usually open but just not staffed.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/iceland-photography/,Magical Iceland: How It Looks to Set Foot in Narnia,Iceland,"That we leave our homes, that we step through our doors to the world, that we travel our whole lives not because we want to collect exotic T-shirts, […] but because it has the power to renew us—not the guarantee, not the promise, just the possibility. Because there are places our imaginations can never construct for us, and there are people who we will never meet but we could and we might. It reminds us that there is always a reason to begin again.― Stephen Markley, Tales of Iceland  It’s a bit tough to put Iceland into words. Some call it the land of fire and ice, but they’re leaving out a big part of it – the greenery, the changing colors, the wild seas, the black sand beaches, rainbows, painted mountains, the thousands upon thousands of waterfalls all over the country, and most importantly for me, the green lights in the sky. It gets to the point as you road trip through Iceland that you finally just stop pointing waterfalls out and learn that you can’t pull over every time you see a photo opportunity because you simply wouldn’t get farther than 30 or so kilometers in one day if you did. It’s that stunning. I visited Iceland in October and it was the perfect time for several reasons: The weather was mild, the amount of daylight and nighttime was almost equal, and the fall colors blanketed the ground and covered the trees. It left me wondering if I’d ruined the rest of the travels that lay ahead of me, simply because I might have already visited the most beautiful country on earth. Its official name is Iceland, but to me, it was Narnia. Here are ten photos to prove it, along with the camera settings so that you can replicate them: One big reason to visit Iceland in October was the opportunity to see the aurora borealis (Northern lights). In the summer, there’s hardly any darkness and in the winter, there’s hardly any daylight which really limits daytime activities. The shoulder season turned out to be a perfect combination of night and day. Lifting some tips from Expert Vagabond, the plan was to have as much flexibility as possible. My buddy, Maksim, and I did this by renting a camper van and checking out the aurora forecast before we decided which direction to head in for our week-long Ring Road trip. We planned so that we’d have the best possible chance for clear and dark skies. It paid off, and we got three nights of auroa activity at a level 5, which is high. The way it swirled and danced across the sky was spectacular, and it really was as bright as you see in the photo above. The camera must be completely still for such a long exposure so get a tripod and remote or use your phone as the remote. Also, keep in mind that a wide-angle lens is generally much better for night photography, as you can get much more of the sky in the frame. Even if it’s not as bright for you, with the right camera settings, you can still photograph it. If you see grey in the sky or slight movement, point your camera at it with the following settings and you may be able to capture it: Camera settings: F/4.5, 15-seconds, manual focus, ISO 2500 Equipment: Sony A6000, wide-angle lens, tripod, phone as remote I peeked out the window from my camper van right as the sun rose over these floating bits and pieces of glacier. The Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon is the world’s only glacier lagoon and an absolutely gorgeous one at that. I ended up with so many shades of blue and purple, it was surreal. Camera settings: f 5.0, 1/160, ISO 160 Equipment: Sony A6000, 16-55m lens, hand-held Aysbergi is Iceland’s answer to the US’ Grand Canyon. While it’s certainly smaller in scale, it looked so lovely with the fall colors popping up like little orange and red cotton balls from above, and it has a special beauty all its own. Camera settings: Intelligent auto. While most of the time, I like to mess with my own settings, the Sony A6000’s auto settings are often just as good if not better in normal lighting conditions, and it’s a much quicker option for when you’re hiking, like we were. Equipment: Sony A6000, wide-angle lens, hand-held Shortly after discovering the vista of the canyon, the landscape changed completely to brittle rocks and volcanic sand. It was the closest I’ve ever felt to being on another planet. Seriously, Mars movies could be (and maybe have been?) shot here. Camera settings: Intelligent auto Equipment: Sony A6000, wide-angle lens, hand-held I’ve never seen a waterfall quite like this that had a full path to walk behind. I’ve stuck my face under the spray of a good many and slid down a few here and there, but this one didn’t even seem like a waterfall. It looked like a bridal veil. Like much of the other sights in Iceland, this seemed to be straight out of a storybook and I questioned how something so perfect could actually exist. Equipment: GoPro  Icelandic ponies are famous for their thick, soft fur and long manes of flowing hair. This one looks like in a past life it was probably a unicorn, with that gorgeous white mane and one blue and one dark brown eye. Camera settings: Intelligent auto Equipment: Sony A6000, 16-55m lens, hand-held Svartifoss, meaning black waterfall, is amazing any time of year with its black, hexagonal basalt columns. The autumn, however, saw it covered from head to toe in golden leaves of change. I saw thousands, literally thousands, of waterfalls in Iceland, but if I had to pick a favorite, it would be this one. Camera settings: f/10, 1-second, ISO 100 Equipment: Sony A6000, 16-55m lens, tripod, filter, phone as remote Even though it was a 3-hour detour from our ring road trip, when Maksim and I saw this waterfall in photos, we knew we had to get there. It was definitely worth the trip, because it’s so unique with its four falls and peaking mountain behind it. Even though it is popular with the tourists, I was able to get a shot without anyone in it by just waiting out the crowds. Photography-wise, a wide-angle lens was the real game-changer here, able to get the whole falls and mountain in the shot together without cutting off parts of the scenery. Camera settings: f/10, 0.4 seconds, ISO 100 Equipment: Sony A6000,wide-angle lens, tripod, filter, phone as remote This rushing waterfall, Godafoss, was huge, and the way the sun decided to peek out from the clouds at that moment made it look golden, too. Though my wide-angle lens did take pretty good shots of the waterfall, my GoPro was the camera that really captured the shape and even accentuated it. Equipment: GoPro  How can you talk about Iceland without talking about the Blue Lagoon? Though bathhouses are common all around Iceland with heated pools like this one, what makes the blue lagoon stand out is obviously the color, and the mud masks you can brush onto your face to make it into a real spa day. The GoPro was perfect for this as there’s no problem getting these wet, and the way they take photos half out of water is pretty cool! Equipment: GoPro  Iceland is one of the most stunning and diverse countries I’ve ever visited. In one moment, you’re standing on a black sand beach and the next, you’re looking at hundreds of waterfalls at once. If you get a chance to go, grab it with both hands and enjoy the wild weather, rugged landscape, and hopefully, gorgeous green lights in the sky.   Kristin, I LOVE the site’s new look! I haven’t been on in a while (I do read your emails though) and you continue to make me jealous. Thanks Ben! And thanks for keeping up with the blog via email too <3 Your photos are so beautiful! Seeing the Northern Lights has always been a huge goal of mine…someday! Was mine as well and I know that we got incredibly lucky. Going hunting for them again in Finland at the end of the month and hoping I get lucky again! These photos are incredible!! I love all your pics! So much that I traded my camera in for the one you use!  🙂 I’m going to Iceland in less than 3 weeks and i cannot wait to shoot with it! Iceland looks like a different planet. It totally felt like one! It’ll be gorgeous and I can’t wait to see your pics. I hope you’ll come back and link them! Huge, big WOW! Those are really fantastic places; indeed, they look more like fairyland than real earth! Hope to visit Iceland someday. Happy new year! Happy New Year to you as well! And yes, even standing there staring at it, I had to pinch myself and ask if it was really real. My best friend and I are hoping to visit Iceland this year! (A pretty cheap flight for us out of Boston.) Breathtaking photos, I’m totally (re)inspired! 🙂 There are tons of cheap flights from the US, especially Boston! You should do it. It’s a bit expensive but it’s really worth it. I mean look at it! So much beauty and bang for your buck, really. Aurora Borealis is so beautiful! We saw it few weeks ago in Finland. Amazing! I’m heading to Finland at the end of the month! Excited to see them again (I hope)! You’re so amazingly talented! Aw love you! Wow, very beautiful pictures ! I visited Iceland in May 2015 after dreaming about it for a long time and it did’nt disappoint ! The glacier lagoon was easily one of my favorite as well as Svartifoss 🙂 But instead of northern lights I got midnight sun ! I don’t know if you also got to visit the West fjords, but I saw a part of it and it was well worth it ! I really wanted to visit the West Fjords but ran out of time. I want to go back and this time spend much longer hiking and visiting the fjords as well! Gahhhh! I want Iceland in my life right now. WOW! Just wow. What an incredible and unique place. I keep seeing Iceland pop up all over blogs and such but it still seems like there is nobody ever there, like otherworldly. Thank you for sharing the camera settings for all of these as well, really awesome tips. And phenomenal photos as usual Kristin =) I kind of want to frolic through the canyon. Did you frolic? Ah you’ve brought back incredible memories for me! Loving this post 🙂 I went last year and one week was not enough for the magic that is Iceland. A camper van is a brilliant idea, I think I’ll have to revisit for this reason! How long did you go for and did you camp the whole time? We drove along the ring road for 7 days and yes we camped the whole time. I’d do it that way again! Thanks for sharing the Tales of Iceland quote 🙂 Hi! What time did you visit in October? I will be in Iceland on 21st October onwards. I was wondering if it would be bare or there would still be the colours of fall? The first 10 days of the month. It must depend on the season, temperatures, and rainfall partially Hi Kristin, I just came across your blog on Pinterest and got really interested on your photography tips.  Thank you for sharing them.  I read you other post and really love them especially that one of Iceland. Thank you so much! I’m so glad that you have found the tips helpful. Let me know if anything is missing or you have any questions that haven’t been answered on here 🙂 Love your blog.  We are heading to Iceland next year and plan to rent a campervan also.  We shoot for Sep to avoid the crowd and when it is not too cold. Have fun! It’s gorgeous. Your site totally rocks! So much inspiration in one place! We love this! Yay thanks!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/path-of-the-gods-amalfi-coast/,A Guide to the Path of the Gods on Italy’s Amalfi Coast,Italy,"The Path of the Gods, or “Sentiero degli Dei” in Italian, is a clifftop trail running between Bomerano (in Agerola) and Nocelle (near Positano) along Italy’s Amalfi Coast. Situated halfway up Mount Sant’Angelo a Tre Pizzi, the trail averages at about 1640 feet (500m) above sea level. It is often referred to as the best hike in the world for its breathtaking views of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The trail once acted as the only means of communication between the Amalfi Coast’s villages. Interestingly, it was named the “Path of the Gods” by Italian politician and historian Giustino Fortunato in the late 19th century for its mythological roots in the tale of The Odyssey (Legend has it that the gods once rushed to save Ulysses from the singing Sirens of Capri, stamping out this path in the process.) When I visited the Amalfi Coast this May, I knew I wanted to work in some exercise and amazing views in between all of the eating and chilling (and more eating and more chilling). It ended up being a gorgeous trail with spectacular views of Positano the whole way, and it’s pretty easy to walk. Here’s what you need to know about walking the Path of the Gods on the Amalfi Coast. The trail is fairly easy to follow, as it is only about 4 miles (6.5km) long and is clearly marked with signs. It takes around 2 to 2.5 hours to complete in each direction. While the trail can be hiked in either direction, it is recommended that the trail be followed east to west, from Bomerano to Nocelle, rather than vice versa. This allows for the best views and for an easier hike, as the path runs slightly downhill from this direction. I began my hike from where I was staying in Praiano, which meant a lot of stairs to climb to the top. As anyone who has spent time on the Amalfi Coast knows, there will be stairs involved. From Praiano, I was able to join the Path of the Gods trail and make my way back to Bomerano, which was only slightly backwards to get to the beginning. There’s also the option of taking the lower or upper trail. You’ll know when they branch because you’ll come to a fountain with ‘Positano’ and ‘Praiano’ etched into the stone pointing in opposing directions. Head away from the sea when you see this and it’ll bring you to the upper trail, which is, trust me, more spectacular and not that much more difficult. Whichever way you choose, the trail is fairly uneven and rocky, so wear good shoes. If you want to experience the hike without a lot of other people, get an early start. By mid-morning the crowds will begin appearing, though it wasn’t all that bad when I was there in May. I imagine it’s worse in the summer, and hotter too! If you choose to get a rental car, there is free parking in Bomerano at the intersection of Via Casalone and the main road SS366. In Bomerano, there are signs leading from Bomerano piazza to the start of the trail. By public transportation, you can take a SITA bus (SITA being the local bus company) to or from several locations on the coast. You can find the SITA bus schedules here (It is important to note that the bus schedule is updated every few months, so make sure that you are always referring to the most recent timetable.) Bus tickets can be purchased at most bars or tabacchi shops and you must buy them in advance. To get to Bomerano from Agerola or Amalfi, take the SITA bus running between Amalfi, Agerola, and Naples and get off at the stop for Bomerano. From there, follow the signs toward the trail. This should take about 40 minutes from Amalfi and 10 minutes or less from any of the stops in Agerola. If you are staying in Positano, it is a bit more difficult to get up to Bomerano. Perhaps the best way is to take the SITA bus which runs between Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi. Get off at Amalfi, and take the bus mentioned above from Amalfi to Bomerano. This will take about 90 minutes. Unfortunately, it is a bit out of the way to go all the way to Amalfi and then backtrack to Bomerano, but there is no direct bus route between Positano and Bomerano. Another option is to take a ferry from Positano to Amalfi and then take the bus to Bomerano. The ferry ride is about 30 minutes long (approximately 20 minutes shorter than the bus ride) and costs between $9-$11 (€8-€10). Weekly ferry schedules and ticket prices are available here. If you are coming from Praiano, you have two options. Praiano is connected to the trail through a long staircase of over 1,000 stone steps, so you can add an hour or more to your hike and follow the stairs to the trail. However, if you want to start at the head of the trail, you can take a combination of buses to the very beginning in Bomerano. The Sorrento-Positano-Amalfi bus makes a stop at Praiano, so ride this bus to Amalfi. Then, take the second bus from Amalfi to Bomerano. From Sorrento, you can once again take the SITA bus which runs between Sorrento, Positano, and Amalfi, and then take the bus previously mentioned from Amalfi to Bomerano. This takes on average a little over 2 hours. Once you arrive at the end of the trail in Nocelle, you have the option of continuing on to Positano. There are three ways to do this: If you’re feeling ambitious, you can simply walk the trail back to Bomerano; however, remember that the trail will be going slightly uphill this time and that it will take another couple of hours to get back to where you started. If you would prefer to only do the hike one-way down to Nocelle, you will need to take the bus from Nocelle to Positano, and from Positano take the appropriate SITA bus (or buses) back to Amalfi, Agerola, Bomerano, Praiano, or Sorrento. You can also just take a taxi, which I did when the sky opened up and started pouring. That said, prepare for any kind of weather if you’re hiking it in the shoulder seasons. I experienced 3 seasons in one day! Overall, though, rain, sweat, and sunshine, it was a gorgeous trail that can be made easier or more difficult depending on how many stairs and buses you involve. The Path of the Gods is a must-do when on the Amalfi Coast and the perfect way to offset all of that pasta and gelato!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-take-low-light-pictures/,How to Take Ethereal Low-Light Pictures,Italy,"I always thought that there was some big secret that everyone who took amazing low-light and long exposure photos knew that I didn’t know. I figured it was probably a difficult technique or maybe something that only fancy cameras could do, until doing some research, playing around with my camera settings, and realizing that it wasn’t rocket science at all. There’s no big secret, and taking successful low-light pictures boils down to two things: the right settings, and the right equipment. For any kind of low-light photos, of course you need a camera (<– captain obvious). Phones don’t perform very well in low-light settings and nothing in this post involves flash, as I believe it’s the ruiner of landscape photography. Most DSLR cameras will do the trick in low light, and everything in this post was shot on my Sony a6000 with a wide-angle lens (though the lens doesn’t have to do with the ability to shoot in low light. It’s just the one I use and love the most). I also recommend a cheap tripod from Amazon. (You can find the rest of the gear I use here). You also have to be able to see what you’re doing and then to easily be able to turn that light off again so that the light doesn’t wash out the foreground of your photo. In this case I almost always use a headlamp to keep my hands free. For this post I’ve also teamed up with VARTA Consumer to show you a few other little tools, such as strings of battery-powered lights, an adjustable waterproof headlamp with several settings to help in fog, low light, and complete darkness (I use this for hiking and camping too!), and lightweight, LED lanterns that can all help to make a low-light photo look even more magical and ethereal. The reason why you need a tripod, or something sturdy to balance your camera on, when taking low-light pictures is because the camera needs to be completely still. This means that you also need to set a timer release when you take the photo so that the movement from your hand pressing the button doesn’t cause the camera to move as it’s taking the photo. You can also use a remote or even your phone if your camera is able to connect to your phone (mine is). In manual, you can change up the settings for three main things as it pertains to your low-light photos: Here are a few examples and my settings for each: Sometimes clouds can ruin a perfect summer day but I often find that they can contribute to making a photo better as long as you know how to make cloudy weather work for you. I’ve been to Lago di Braies in South Tyrol, Italy, twice but it’s very normal to have a bit of cloud cover there. No big deal, because the color of the lake is so stunning it needs no competition from a blue sky. For this shot, I put my camera on a tripod and set it to F14, ISO 100, and a 10-second exposure. I also set it to a 10-second timer and went and stood in the photo. You can see that my shirt, hair, and left hand moved a bit. I’ll blame a light breeze for the first two issues but admit I must’ve moved my hand. I love the glassy look of the water in this picture, and recommend this setting if you want to make the water look like mist in your photos in low-light situations (during daylight you’ll need a filter, but that’s another post subject entirely). Blue hour is the hour before the sun rises in the morning or after it sets in the evening. If you’re near water, this is a great time to get an ethereal night shot that makes the water look like mist without needing a filter to combat the excessive light coming in. About 30 minutes after the first picture in this post, I strung up some VARTA Consumer lights, put on a headlamp, and placed some of the smaller LED lamps around to make the photo look even more magical. I love the way that adding a few lights to a photo can really warm it up even if it otherwise looks dark and cool. This can be a total game changer to making an otherwise dark picture seem warm and inviting. I changed my settings to F4 (to let in more light), ISO 100, and 20 seconds. Once again, I had to hold very still for the picture. Tip: If you want to be in the picture, stand farther away from the camera and use a friend or a remote to take the picture for you. That way, even if you move a bit, it won’t be as obvious. Also, headlamps almost always make night photography look even cooler by adding a warm streak to the photo and shining out into the distance. When the sun is completely down and barely any light is left, you’ll want to find some way of lighting up whatever subject you’re taking a picture of, unless it has some light of its own. I either do this by flashing my headlamp light in the direction of my subject for a second or so, or by adding some light to the picture, as I did with the string of lights in the camper van, plus the lanterns inside of the van and up in the roof tent for this shot. Since there was so much light already in the foreground, I put my camera on a tripod, a 10-second timer, and F2.6, ISO 2000, and a 6-second exposure. We had to retake the picture about 10 times because we kept laughing at each other and moving during the shots. If I’ve learned anything, it’s that low-light photos are usually not quite right the first time around, but take some experimentation, trial, and error. Of course, it always helps if your subject matter is beautiful, as is definitely the case with South Tyrol, Italy. For more on my favorite spots there to hang out and photograph, read this next. *This post (obviously) was brought to you in collaboration with Visit South Tyrol and VARTA Consumer. I love the way the battery-powered lights make my photos look that much cooler and my reviews of the products and locations are sincere. Your trust always comes first.  This was super helpful! I just got myself a proper camera (instead of the phone..)  and I’m so excited to go out and experiment with it 😛 Let me know how it goes for you! I asked and you answered! Thanks for the tips! Going to use these on my trip to Ko Phi Phi! 🙂 Aaahh, yes adding the light will do the trick, and the picture looks better with the smaller LED lamps. I’ve never thought of adding the remote app to my camera, now I am going to add it. Do you use the Smart Remote Control for your a6000? Sometimes I do that and sometimes I just use the timer release. I have a remote too which for some reason I have trouble with. It’s my third one now so I wonder if the problem is me! really useful, thank you! I’ve always struggled to get those low light shots to look as good as they are in real life I found it’s all about long exposure I love dark and low-light pictures. It’s one of the next photography challenges I want to tackle! Astrophotography really opened my eyes to what is possible with a long exposure. Makes me happy to know that taking pictures doesn’t have to stop when the sun goes down! I got really excited that we’re using the same camera! Thank you for indicating your camera settings for each scenario! Really helpful! Officially subscribed to your site! Awesome! Once I master milky way photography there will be a post to follow on that too 🙂 Best way to get great milky way shots (and stars even) is to ensure your camera’s shutter speed is minimum 30 seconds, you’ll have to play around with your aperture because that will depend on the moon phase (different moon phases shed more or less light altering your aperture). If you want to do star trails take multiple 30 second shots and string them together in photoshop! If your shutter speed is longer than 30 seconds you might find your stars aren’t as crisp because of the movement of the earth. Make sure your focus is set to infinite! and good luck! Doesn’t that depend on the lens you use, though? I heard that the time your shutter is open would depend on that. great article! helpful and easy to follow! I took photography in school but still LOVE reading these kinds of posts to see tips and tricks other people use! This is a great post for beginners and does a wicked job explaining it! I love that you run into your long(er) exposure photos to add that little something extra!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/dolomites-italy-hiking/,"A Camper Van Adventure in South Tyrol, Italy",Italy,"Hello from sunny and green South Tyrol in Italy, a region you may have noticed I can’t stop coming back to. What I love about it now is the same feeling I had when I came here the first time and again six months later with my mother – it’s just so darn unexpected and not at all what I would have normally thought of when I pictured Italy in my mind’s eye. South Tyrol is so green and covered with wild flowers in the early summer and changing leaves in the fall. If you love the outdoors (and you know that I do!) there’s an endless list of hikes, via Ferrara, rock climbing, skiing in the winter, oh, and really nice food. I also just love that as I drive through here I keep seeing castles (South Tyrol, by the way, is home to 800 of them), Alpine huts, and sharply-sloping rolling green mountains covered in grape vines. Given my love of camping and increasing need to stay connected and charged while doing so, when battery company VARTA Consumer asked me to join them using and taking photos of their flashlights, powerpacks, and batteries along with my bestie Yvonne, I didn’t hesitate to say ‘yes.’ Can you think of a more perfect job for me than a week camping throughout my favorite part of Italy? Here’s what it’s been all about so far: I’m all about hiking and of course everywhere has its own special beauty. Though I’d never say one place is definitively better than the others, if we’re talking purely about landscape and quality and variety of the trails, the mountain range I love the most is the Alps. A really gorgeous part of them runs through South Tyrol. The huts running all through them with comforts of home, the intense greenery, and the dramatic mountain peaks all combine to win me over. I also really love the variety of cultures all through them, and nowhere is that more evident than South Tyrol. Yes, the beaches down south and Tuscany sure are nice, but I just love the hiking up here. It’s what keeps me coming back. This time I hiked from the Rifugio Alpe di Tires 2440 M (yes that’s the name!) over to Rifugio Bolzano. You can hike up to the Rifugio Alpe di Tires 2440 M as well from the valley, which is accessible by public transport (In my case, I took a Jeep up as we were low on time). It’s a rather easy hike with a few short and steep upward parts between the Rifugios. On a clear day you can see layers upon layers of mountains and valleys in every direction. I also loved how different this hike looked coming and going. I was like doing two totally different hikes! It took about two hours each way, although of course everyone is different. Camping in a camper van is pretty easy in South Tyrol and I found that the campgrounds featured pretty nice bathrooms as well. My favorite so far (I’m still going!) is Corones which has a pool and even little wine barrel rooms with heating and power plugs. Plugs weren’t a big deal for us, though. We had all the power we needed in several power banks from VARTA Consumer as well as lights galore. If you’ve been reading for a while you already know, food isn’t really something I talk much about (that’s why Jenn is so great!), unless I’m in Italy, that is. Thanks to an awesome local’s recommendation, Yvonne and I tried the food at Gostner Schwaige, a hut in the valley below the hike we did, known for colorful and inventive food made with tons of local flowers. Seriously having lunch there was like walking into a field of flowers, intentionally face planting, and eating everything in sight, but only way more artfully chosen and paired together. It’s all about freshness and creativity. Who doesn’t love that? The sparkling wine was spiked with rose and pine, the salad consisted of 24 different leaves and flowers, and the main dishes were so full of flavor and color, it made me think for a moment that I’m a food blogger as I snapped away photo after photo of the food. Usually I just forget and dig right in but this was too beautiful to disturb before digging in. I know I’m gushing but seriously, go there, and you’ll fall in love too. Unless you hate flowers, but I’ve never met anyone who has! In my effort to post more often in the moment, writing this from a campground, this is my impression of campervanning it in South Tyrol so far. Unsurprisingly, I still love it just as much as I always have. More to come soon! *This post (obviously) was brought to you in collaboration with Visit South Tyrol and VARTA Consumer. I would never camp without batter power and my reviews of the products, campgrounds, and food are all sincere. Your trust always comes first.  What a great post! I’ve never heard of this place before – wow what a stunning landscape and trip. And your camper van looks so freakin’ cool! Thanks Stephanie! This is the best camper van I’ve ever had for sure! Wow, that hiking looks amazing. Plus, I already am in love with the wine from South Tyrol, so now I really need to add it to my list! Wow – what a stunning area, and the food photos look to die for! How beautiful. I’ve been following along on Instagram and it’s nice to see the photos in a bigger size. The camper looks so cute and cozy! I’m going on a 1,5 week hike in Dolomites in early August and your post made me even more impatient 😀 Beautiful images of a wonderful place! We feel exactly the same way about South Tyrol and have visited twice (and hopefully more soon). It’s so underrated and lovely. This is a great post and we’ve shared it with our newsletter readers this week, so thank you! Thank you so much for sharing! Yes it’s a very special place and I’ve gone back twice too! Did you rent that camper van? More info please! We certainly didn’t buy it! You can find it in Munich. That’s where we picked it up from. Hi Kristin,  I love this post and plan on doing this in May. Do you know what company the camper van was from? Thanks!Marteen It was booked in Munich actually. You might want to look closer! Hi Kristen. Can we have a company name for the hire out of Munich –  as you’re stated..? I’m not sure who we booked with, sorry! I’d go for Google. Kristin,your post are really great. I am glad you had the chance to taste – for the first time the real taste of Parmigiano. However i noticed that Tuscany is not yet part of your radar screen.I know that you will be back in Italy – sooner than later – so I put myself at your disposal to discover the hidden Tuscany. As my guest, I will show you the amazing Crete Senesi by e-bike, for example an then a relaxing experience in a natural hot springs to relax. I would really love it.Hugs from Tuscany! and congratulations for your amazing blog! Aw thanks for the invite! I haven’t been there since I was 20 and would love to go back.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ahrntal-south-tyrol-italy/,Journey to a Hidden Valley in Italy,Italy,"Have you ever arrived somewhere a bit apprehensive, afraid that you may have chosen unwisely when a big attraction is located just an hour or so away? Have you ever been so pleasantly surprised to find that you actually made the best choice ever? Welcome to Ahrntal, Italy. When mother and I continued our journey following Granny’s footsteps around Europe, it took us to a place I hadn’t heard much about before. We had some leeway since it wasn’t super specific, but settled on a valley called Ahrntal since I had already been to other parts of South Tyrol and had fallen in love with the food and discovered I like rock climbing in the Dolomites (famous local mountains and a UNESCO World Heritage Site). When we initially looked at the spot on a map again en route on Eurail, Mom pointed out that it was pretty far from the famous Dolomites. It was all that she knew of the region, and it was all I knew as well. I was a little nervous but optimistic. Then, we arrived and discovered a quaint and far less touristy little valley that was full of greenery and little mountain chalets. Even better, there were so many hiking trails all over the place that there was no chance of boredom, with or without the Dolomites next door. Unexpected Bliss A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jul 8, 2015 at 3:06am PDT  What I loved about Ahrntal is how undiscovered it still is. South Tyrol, especially where the Dolomites are (closer to Bolzano) is not exactly a secret destination but this German-speaking, Alpine region of Italy is still not what most people picture when they think of an Italian holiday. I guess that’s why I dig it so much – it’s unexpected. I like this region of Italy for just about every kind of holiday – family, solo (I loved the interactions I had with locals there), and I can imagine it being perfect for romantic holidays, too. I was also happy to come back and see it in a different season since it was full of fall foliage the last time I was there. The summer greenery gave me a new level of appreciation, just like I’m sure the winter does with its snow blankets. Alpenpalace We partially chose this valley because of the Hotel Alpenpalace. It looked so stunning from the photos, plus it included meals that consisted of several courses, plus a pick up from the train station and rides to the surrounding hikes – our main reason for being there. They also offered activities like guided hikes and yoga daily as well. We didn’t partake since we had our sights set on one hike in particular, but it struck me how, if one were to really take advantage of everything offered, the price of a five-star starts to even out to what a cheaper hotel would be where snacks, meals, and activities aren’t included. Mom and I also couldn’t get over how fun and cute our server, Antonio, was. Always saying, “anything for you Madame,” to my mother. Here’s a little video if you’d like to see more:  Hiking Perfection The trail we set our sights on is called Speikboden – also a popular skiing slope in the winter. We were pretty impressed before we even started walking, finding that we had the trail almost entirely to ourselves all day. Each step provided us with yet another view and another perspective of the gorgeous valley. Then we rounded a corner, and, both in awe, my mother said, “this is every other mountain view on steroids” and I agreed. It was easy to see why those who live among these mountains erect crosses every so often along the trails and at the top of various peaks. When you’re surrounded by such profoundly beautiful nature, it becomes that much easier to believe in a higher power – a divine hand that could have created something otherwise beyond imagination. To get to the top where the hiking is the best, I suggest taking the round-trip cable car + chairlift combo ticket for €17. You still get plenty of steep hiking in if you take the route we did, which was the panorama trail plus the trail to the giant cross from the start of the cable car to the chairlift. It took us all day, with a break for lunch, to do it all. It’s also possible to go before sunrise on Wednesdays, which, if we’d been there on a Wednesday, I would have insisted on. As it was, we got up there right in the early morning, during what I can only refer to as “blue hour” given how the mountain layers looked plus the Dolomites in the distance. Nothing is too far away Pretty close to where we stayed, there was a gorgeous little water fall and a hiking trail that ran right up to it. The falls were beautiful on their own, but what really delighted me was peering in the other direction, and seeing a full-on circular rainbow on the other side. If you still want to see the Dolomites or the famous Lago di Braies, everything is just a short drive or bus ride away. My second return to South Tyrol within the year was such an excellent decision, and I was so happy to return with my mother, especially after saying to a local last time I was there, “I’m coming back, and next time I’m bringing my mother with me.” The fact that it worked out so perfectly as we followed Granny’s journal just added to the perfection. Thanks for the beauty, Ahrntal. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Hotel Alpenpalace and Eurail. As always, you can trust that everything I’ve written is what I really feel. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend either company for your South Tyrol vacation. Those photos are truly amazing. What a place! And that hotel! You’re totally right. It’s funny how we tend to think that there are no hidden gems like this and nothing new to discover. But then we risk going to a new, little talked about place, and our minds are blown. This is a great example. It’s one of the reasons why I keep telling myself that I should travel more in my own country, Spain. I’ve been to many of the main attractions. But I’m sure there are quite a few hidden valleys, beaches and lakes waiting to be discovered (by me, at least) So true, Fernando. I keep learning about new things in California (like this?! What? http://bit.ly/1MzgQe9) and it makes me realize how much I never knew about even growing up right there. So much of the world is undiscovered and so much of it is RIGHT NEXT to huge tourist spots. LOL, that mountain is quite something.Made me think of this “cathedral” built by a Spanish monk near Madrid: http://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-d-spain-20141221-story.html Many unfinished cathedrals in Spain! 😉 New follower here, found your blog while researching hiking Macchu Picchu. I’m already hooked on your travels! Beautiful photos and I love that you travel off the beaten path! Pretty cool that’s how you found me because I’ve actually never been to South America! Haha. Welcome and thanks so much for your kind comment! You love hiking and heading off the beaten path – Sounds like we’re kindred spirits 🙂 Stunning photos and very inspiring post. I fell in love with that hotel. What a view! Thank you for giving examples of hidden treasures like this. Hi,A friend sent me an e-mail she had received about Iceland,  in trolling the Trip Advisor e-mail I found your article about Iceland.  Interesting read, beautiful photos.  My husband and I are going May/June – 24 day trip doing the Ring Road.  You missed “arctic henge’?  In the fall we are considering Sicily so I wanted to see if you have been and if so your comments.  Didn’t see anything about Sicily but I did come across your blog about the Dolomites.  We ran out of time to go there on a previous trip  so now planned to go there on our way to or from Sicily.  Did you rent a car, and what city did you fly into.  Have been to 62 countries and Lord willing will continue doing so.  We are senior travelers. Haven’t been to those spots but I’m sure they’re all amazing.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/toerggelen-in-south-tyrol/,Törggelen: Italian Thanksgiving in South Tyrol,Italy,"As the Autumn days here in Berlin get a bit colder and the last of the leaves are falling, I look at the calendar and see that one of my favorite holidays from back home in the US is coming up: Thanksgiving. I have celebrated it in interesting ways since I started traveling. My first year it was a spread of fish, noodles, and a pot of potatoes – the closest we could get to the real thing – in Mui Ne, Vietnam with two new Australian friends. In the Maldives last year, it was an interesting mix of Tang orange drink and seafood pizza. Let’s just say I’d rather not repeat that meal. Just about a month ago in South Tyrol, Italy, however, which I visited just as they were finishing up the harvest season, it was a local thanksgiving tradition known as Törggelen. This particular region in Alpine Italy is, historically, a meeting point between Italians and Germans starting in the middle ages. Over time it has changed hands, and is now a region of Italy that maintains its own locally-run and funded public transport and public services. Locals joke that it’s good for tourists because it’s a beautiful part of Italy to visit, but things work like in Germany. Though I’ve only lived in Berlin for a short time, I know what that means: like clockwork. All through the region I heard people speaking both German and Italian to each other. “How do you know which to speak with someone?” I asked my local friend Deborah. “You just feel it,” she replied. Right. This side of the Alps gets twice as many sunny days as in Austria, yet from the snowmelt has no shortage of clean, “soft” water, has mind-blowingly gorgeous countryside, world-class skiing, rock climbing on world-famous mountains, and truly has a culture and all its own. Food wise, this is also true. South Tyrol is known for growing delicious apples (I can vouch), developing a deliciously salty and flavorful smoked and cured meat called speck, and producing delicious wine and beer as well, among many other things. I really liked learning about the wine in this region, mostly because it tasted so good and seemed a rare treat that is not widely available around the world. South Tyrol is the smallest region in Italy for wine production, representing only 1% of the market. Since all of the flat areas in this mountainous region are devoted to apple growing, most farmers here have small mountainside farms. Therefore, it’s hard for many of them to have large, private wineries. For this reason, many wineries here work on a co-op model. The farmers each contribute their harvest for the season to a local winery, and all profits after the production and sale of the wine are redistributed back to the farmers. While it’s typical in Italy for about 30% of wineries to work using this method, here in South Tyrol, it’s more like 70%. This winery, Cantina Valle Iscaro, offers private wine tours and tastings. I even had the chance to explore with the new General Manager, who then served up some of the best wine I have ever tasted. After each glass I found myself asking, “so is this available in Berlin?” I use the term, “Thanksgiving” loosely, as Törggelen occurs over the course of an entire month and is celebrated with harvest festivals and long meals of several courses shared with friends, family, and co-workers. During the course of the autumn season, Deborah tells me that she typically attends Törggelen at least 2-3 times. The meal is served in a farm house which raises the pigs and grapes on the property. The subsequent harvest, slaughter, and production of all of the foods and beverages enjoyed over the course of the Törggelen all come from the very farm the meal is enjoyed at. Talk about farm-to-table goodness! The feast kicks off with speck, which if you have familiarity with proscuitto (cured and salted pork leg), has its similarities though speck is smoked and unique to South Tyrol. It is also highly addictive and one must exercise great restraint to not fill up on speck before the rest of the meal rolls out. Also featured is a thin, hard cracker with anise seeds inside, another food unique to South Tyrol and often consumed in conjunction with speck. What typically follows this appetizer is the vegetable soup, again featuring veggies that have been picked on the farm: The next course features light, fried pieces of bread that reminded me of a lighter, savory version of a Southern beignet, served with sauerkraut. This is where the meal started to get difficult, because I had run out of room and, as Deborah warned might happen, had filled up on speck. I’m not a quitter, though, and managed to resist filling up on too much bread before the main event arrived, which was freshly-made pork sausage. With a plate of sausage in front of me and hearing the German language spoken around me, it really felt to me like I was back in Germany, yet remembering the speck and drinking the wine, it was clear I was still in Italy. Partway through the meal, the owner of the home and chief farmer extraordinaire gave us and other diners who asked a tour of the various rooms where the wine is made and the slaughter, smoking, and aging take place. It really blew me away how much work was involved and how incredibly local and fresh my meal had been. All around us, tables full of people laughed, played cards, and drank the young wine – somewhere in the aging process between grape juice and wine, but still very much fermented. The meal finished with pastry and the crown jewel: roasted chestnuts. As is typical with me, I did not photograph dessert because I tend to eat it before thinking. Who feels me on that one? Though a longer meal than I’m typically used to, I really enjoyed this Thanksgiving feast and was happy to have discovered this truly unique, special corner of Italy. Have you ever celebrated Thanksgiving in another country? What were the biggest differences? *Disclaimer: This post was brought to you in collaboration with the Tourism Board in South Tyrol. However, I never recommend or speak highly of something I don’t truly love. Your trust comes first.    Hi Kristin! Think this might be the first comment I put on your blog, but started to read it in the beginning of this year and have enjoyed reading it 🙂 I am 3 or so weeks into my trip now:) Right now I am in Krabi and I am going with Air Asia from here to Kuala Lumpur the 29 Nov(haven’t decided how long I’m going to stay there). I was wondering if you know if I will need to have booked a departure flight from Malaysia before my arrival? Greetings from the traveling Swede 🙂 Hey Chris,That’s awesome. Thanks for commenting. I haven’t been asked for onward passage when flying in Malaysia since I get a standard 90 day visa upon arrival and I assume you might get the same. This is a really helpful resource! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Swedish_citizens This sounds like an amazing experience: the food, the wine, the unique culture.  In 2012, I experienced Chuseok, kind of like the Korean version of Thanksgiving. At my school, we all dressed in Hanbok (the Korean traditional dress) and made songpyeon (balls of rice cake with chestnuts or other fillings) with the kindergarten students.  It’s so interesting to see how this autumn harvest season is celebrated in different cultures. Thank you for sharing! What a cool tradition! I had no idea South Korea had something similar. I love doing things like this. It makes me feel at home and welcomed when I can participate in the local traditions. Hmm, the sausages 🙂 I love sausage! I did a Christmas in Thailand once and I think I did the same. I sure do love Tom Yum, though. I’m experiencing some serious food envy here! Speck sounds spectacular! Tyrol sounds like a really interesting place to visit. I’ll add it to the list 🙂 Thank you for sharing this! Beautiful city! Hope you enjoyed. Definitely enjoyed 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/via-ferrata-south-tyrol/,"Discovering Via Ferrata in South Tyrol, Italy",Italy,"A friend of mine in Bologna asked me if I planned to do a via ferrata while I was visiting South Tyrol, Italy in the following days. He said it was the thing to do while in the area, so I said, “in that case, yes.” I made the plan without any idea of what a via ferrata is, of course. It turns out I have a habit of accidentally rock climbing. This is now the second time. First if all, I visited South Tyrol because friends had told me it is beautiful. I pretty much go where people with a similar travel style to mine say is awesome, because they’re usually right.  South Tyrol was no exception. First reason: incredible beauty. What was really quite amazing was being there in the autumn. I haven’t experienced changing leaves since I was almost too young to remember – seriously!  So being somewhere going through the harvest season and seeing such gorgeous changing colors was really spectacular. This was mid-October, and to me, the perfect time to check out South Tyrol because it lands between the influx of tourists in the summer and winter months for hiking and skiing, respectively. This is the Alpine region of Italy – which is something I think many travelers who visit the area probably don’t picture when they think of Italy. Maybe famous monuments, churches, beaches, or amazing Italian food come to mind, but do you think of alpine villages, hearing the German and Ladin* languages around you, and eating wurst while in Italy? I know I didn’t before visiting. *A word on Ladin – it’s a language preserved in this region by parents passing onto their young. The dialect changes from valley to valley and as few as 1000 people might speak a particular dialect of Ladin. In school, children begin to learn German, Italian, and also English.  There is one big reason why most people visit South Tyrol – The Dolomites, a rock formation which has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Now I’ve been to a lot of UNESCO sites in my travels, and I usually kind of hate visiting them because the tourism numbers the distinction brings with it usually tend to ruin the place for me. That said, arriving during a shoulder season definitely helped to curb that. It didn’t feel crowded viewing them, and same goes for climbing them. Seeing and climbing the Dolomites ended up being one of the biggest highlights of visiting the region, also famous for its wine, apples, and Thanksgiving feasting (but more on that later). It turns out that via ferrata is a fixed-route climb equipped with cables and ladders. One straps him or herself in to climb up and often rappels down, and, though my running shoes were not ideal for that type of climb (though I have a habit of wearing running shoes in situations they are unhelpful in, like that time I climbed in the snow in Nepal for two weeks in a pair with a hole in them), I was excited to give it a try. I was also characteristically unprepared weather-wise, and my amazing guide grabbed a jacket and sweater from his own closet for me to borrow – Italian hospitality. As we drove down winding mountain roads from Ortisei – a small town in South Tyrol, to the start of the trek my guide, Gregor, excitedly told me about his climbs he had done in the ’70s with friends in California. It was our common ground. He turned on the radio so that I could hear the sound of Ladin changing as we went from valley to valley . I always find language offers a pretty cool insight into the local culture in the way that things are said and the fact that this language has been so carefully preserved is testament to the truly unique culture here. Gregor is super cool. He is like a hybrid tour guide, certified rock and ice climbing badass, and pro photographer in one. He made sure to get some really awesome shots of me climbing throughout the day, which I am grateful for because I’m terrible about asking people to take my photo for me. The climb itself was really fun, and not too difficult. Surely it varies based on your fitness, experience, and perhaps shoe-appropriateness level, but it seems you never can truly run out of via ferratas to try. Gregor Said he has only repeated three all year and has discovered and named several (adorably, after his children) over the last decade or so. Regardless of which you do, my guess is the view is sure to be spectacular. If you’re lucky, even if you’re taking this trek solo like I did, you’ll end up with a brilliant photographer who doubles as a guide as well. South Tyrol really impressed me with its beauty, interesting culture, and warm people. I’d love to return one day. Do you like climbing and hiking as well? Where are your favorite spots? Do It Yourself: *Disclosure: This post was brought to you in collaboration with South Tyrol’s tourism board. All opinions, including being quite stoked to rock climb on accident again, are my own.  I recently did Via Ferrata in Banff National Park in Canada! Such a great experience, a great way to dip your toes into rock climbing if you are a bit intimidated. I used it as a step towards conquering my fear of heights! This area looks stunning, I am envious! It was really fun and made me realize I would probably love rock climbing. Wow! I’ve never had any interest in visiting Italy, but this looks incredible! I’ve always imagined Italy to be completely different. Same here and this really showed me a different side. I find most countries have something like this, that is completely different than what’s on the tourist brochure. It’s like you’re at the top of the world! It looks absolutely amazing. I love rock climbing, so I hope I get to do this too soon 🙂 Characters & Carry-ons That’s how it felt! Really beautiful and peaceful up there. Stunning view from up there! And you were lucky with your guide,too. Indeed one of the setbacks of travelling solo is that nobody can take a good photo of you. But it turned out great! 🙂 Yeah he did a brilliant job! Lovely place and great experience. I don’t know if I will have the courage to do rock climbing but would love to wander in South Tyrol for at least a week. I didn’t go to Torino but the real magic here is in the countryside and hanging out with locals as much as possible. So friendly and I love the traditions. I LOVE rock climbing!!! Climbing in the Dolomites has been on our list of places to go for a while… maybe once we’re back in Europe, and it warms up in 2015. Your pictures of the area are so beautiful! I’d be happy to bring you out climbing sometime… Would love to climb again! This looks so beautiful!  I’d love to do more rock climbing on my travels.  It’s one of those things I know I’d be really into if I had more opportunities.  And your photographs are stunning! Same here so I plan to work it in more. Easy to take stunning photos when the location is so beautiful! Hi there stranger! Glad to see the adventure lives on… Climb Krabi Town if and when you head back to south Thailand – you’ll love it. When’s the next US visit? I will do that. Maybe I’ll do a proper climb in Tonsai actually. I think it’ll be in the late Spring 🙂 Great shots! I once saw a via ferrata that was quite scary, with 800 m cliffs right under you. I was in the zipline then (this was in Copper Canyon, Mexico) which was rather exciting too… This wasn’t quite that steep but if I’m cabled in and have the rope holding me as well, it doesn’t bother me. Then again neither do heights which I can consider myself lucky for! I just did my first via ferrata in France, of all places since I live in Italy, last month and LOVED it! I am so bookmarking this one for the spring when I plan to become a via ferrata climbing queen. Bolzano is only a few hours from us. That’s wonderful! I think if you liked that one you’re sure to love this one as well. Your pictures are INSANELY gorgeous!!!! Wow! Thank you for sharing your adventure. 🙂 Thanks for reading and for the kind words! Oooo. Check you and the great pictures 😉 Such a beautiful place.  Italy is just magical! I always had a fascination about rock climbing. I still regret not trying via Ferrata in Mount Kinabalu! What a great view! I didn’t realize it was possible there! Me too. These photos are amazing! I’ve only ever done one via ferrata, in Switzerland many years ago, but had no idea they had them in Italy, too. So fun! Ah I’m sure they’re all over that part of the world. Cool I guess I need to try it in Switzerland! I worked in Corvara last summer and I could tell straight off that the V.F you did was Cir Spitz. It was my first VF too 🙂 There are so many more in the region to discover – plenty of reasons to go back for a second visit! I had no idea! Very cool 🙂 really beautiful! South Tyrol is one of my favorite place in the dolomites area 🙂 it has a special atmosphere that no other place can offer! great pics, congrats!! Agreed. Thanks! Hi Kristin, very nice place indeed and pictures as well! I like the ones where you are on the high rocks! But…I am sorry but I have to say it! You had completely wrong shoes for such tour! Trekking boots next time! 🙂 You’re totally right and I habitually wear running shoes in non-running shoe situations! I should have had rock climbing shoes but didn’t realize til I was there already that I’d be climbing the Dolomites 🙂 Hey, totally digging the blog. Once i again i came here for info on one part of the world, and ended up with 10 open tabs. Anyways, if I own the harness, carabiners, etc. do I need a guide to do the Via Ferrata routes? Or is it just what most people do? I imagine there are a ton of benefits of the guide, but just trying to see if it’s legal to go more bare bones style. Thanks! Not entirely sure about the rules. I’d contact the local tourism board – visitsouthtyrol.com and they can give you the info!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bologna-food-tour/,I Went to Italy to Eat,Italy,"I went to Italy to eat.  That’s right, I flew to back to Bologna after a year of painful separation for the sole purpose of eating as much as possible, at as many local producers as possible, while trying the biggest variety of foods possible in one week’s time. Italy has many beautiful historical churches and buildings, it’s true. Italy has a stunning countryside and magical islands and beaches – all facts. Italy is also full of really cool people, and I’m privileged to have wonderful friends there. But my reasoning for returning, above all, trumping all else, is Italian food. In particular, my favorite region for feasting is Emilia Romagna. Even the name sounds delicious. Nearly all of my Italian friends agree that it’s the best region for food in all of Italy (coincidentally they happen to also be from Emilia Romagna, but that is neither here nor there). Emilia Romagna is special to me because it’s the first place where I started to really appreciate the importance of food. It’s where I realized how much culture, the family unit, the way a town, city, or nation functions all have to have a lot do with the cultivation, taste, and consumption of food. It was during a 5-hour impromptu lunch with a couple in a the tiny town of Vignola last year, where the entire meal was crafted from either the family’s own garden or neighbor’s dairy and wine cask, that this became apparent to me. Ever since, I’ve realized that almost all of my conversations turn to food. “Oh you’ve been to Chiang Mai? Did you eat Khao soi?” “You went to Vietnam? Omigawd the FOOD is heaven in Vietnam!” or when asked what I miss about home, Mexican food always makes it into my top five. I arrived in Bologna by chance as the mortadella festival was under way. Yes, a festival completely centered around heat-cured finely hashed pork meat, with cubes of neck fat. I tried mortadella in every way imaginable, including as a dessert (the first two courses were great but I’m sorry mortadella, you and dessert are not meant to be together). I also made delicious mortadella, parmesan, and potato pasta for the second time there, with many folk watching, and fared much better than my first futile attempt. Special thanks to the photographer who kept coming over to give me a thumbs up for the essential moral support. Simon, who joined me for the pasta making, documented the recipe perfectly if you’d like to try it at home. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Oct 10, 2014 at 9:42am PDT  Now, I’m not really a fan of most cheese, but parmesan is completely different. I am addicted.  The salty, crumbly goodness of it makes up for cheese’s usual shortcomings of oiliness, gooeyness, and boringness. It’s pretty crazy to see everything that goes into the making of parmesan, from the muscle that goes into draining the moisture, to to the resting, to the salt bath, the sauna, the aging, and eventual cutting and selling. (Sidenote: Did you know the round center piece, which is almost never for sale, is the best part? It’s the “heart” of the cheese). I learned the white spots on the cheese are actually salt deposits, which is a relief because I had honestly always wondered and hoped it wasn’t mold. I also tasted cheeses of several different ages and determined that 24 months is my favorite (there are also 12 and 36 months, etc.). The bonus is anyone can book this hour-long factory exploration and tasting for at Caseificio 4 Madonne in Modena for €5 – and if nobody else books that day, then your guide becomes a private one. Pretty cool! Contact them here. Another salubrious reason to visit this region of Italy is the fine wine. It comes in so many varieties and blends – I feel like I’m always trying and falling in love with something new. This was my third visit to a Lambrusco (sparkling red wine) producer and each time they’ve been pretty different, in size, process, and atmosphere. I was surprised, I don’t know why, to find out that the bubbles in Lambrusco are created from the yeast in the wine eating sugars and giving off the CO2 as a byproduct, just like with the beer I used to brew at home. I hadn’t imagined the two were made in the same way. Armed with that knowledge, drink up! There are so many things in this world that Balsamic vinegar can improve drastically – salad, bread, meat, strawberries, etc. Before I knew any better, I assumed the only way to get nice, thick Balsamic was to reduce it in a pan. Little did I know that aged Balsamic is much thicker and has a really unique flavor to it at each stage in the aging process, which can take up to 25+ years. This was my second visit to a balsamic producer but like the Lambrusco producers, both have had their own flair. The best part Acetaia Paltrinieri’s tour is that it can end with a feast featuring course after course of balsamic-enriched goodness. It’s also shockingly reasonable in price at €25 per person for wine and several courses, including dessert. Contact them to book. I will bring my mother back here. It’s also possible to tour a prosciutto producer if you wish, which we did, but I didn’t take all that many photos of because I have this feeling that you might not be interested in seeing a bunch of meat hanging on the wall. However, for those of you who feel cheated by the absence of a pig thigh visual, here’s some pork lard and bread. Yes, I ate it and yes, it’s amazing and even better than butter. As a closing note, I feel I’ve also found the two best gelato spots in Bologna. I’m open to a debate on this, but I think it’s between Castiglione and Cremeria Funivia (both links lead to their respective locations on Google maps). Try them both and please report your findings. Thanks, Emilia Romagna, for reminding me of why I keep coming back. Do it yourself:  Now I need to know, where’s your favorite foodie destination in the world? *This post comes to you via a collaboration with Tourism Emilia Romagna who initially introduced me to ER a year ago. I returned and was delighted to spend the day exploring with them again. All opinions are a result of copious delicious food and wine.  Kristin, I love reading your blog. Your amazing pictures and stories always feed me with wanderlust. I loved trekking ever since going on a trip to Mongolia last year and it’ll probably remain the best experience in my life. Please do visit the Gorkhi Terelj National Park (that’s where I trekked for 2 weeks) in Mongolia and tell us what you thought of it! I’d love to hear your story! Please keep writing and all the best for your upcoming trips 🙂 Thanks so much for the compliment 🙂 I definitely have many treks ahead of me and that one sounds amazing. My friend recently invited me to Rome and I went with her last minute just because I wanted to eat the food, not necessarily becasue of Rome, but that was  a plus too! It’s just so good! This is pretty much my dream Italy trip–to consume as much good food and wine as possible. I’ve read so much good stuff about Bologna lately, I’ve really got to look into it. Also, never tried  Lambrusco before, but I am intrigued. Great post! It’s really good! I love sparkly anything, pretty much. If you follow your stomach you’re sure to end up in some pretty amazing places! I love what you said about all your conversations turning into food. I feel like I do that all the time and actually pick destinations based on food. I actually get anxiety because I don’t think I’ll have enough time to eat everything. Something, instead of thinking, “hey, I’ve got 7 days in Italy,” I think, “I have 21 meals in eat…plus snacks.” I think my favorite food destinations are Italy (clearly), Turkey, and Thailand. Haha I never thought of it that way, but always try to eat authentic because I really want a chance to try everything too. I can’t wait to go to Turkey and eat everything. I have a pretty good introduction here in Berlin! On the whole, we were actually pretty disappointed with the food we experienced in Italy EXCEPT for Bologna. The food there was absolutely incredible, both the stuff we tried while eating out, and the fantastic meals that our Couch Surfing host and his girlfriend made for us as well. Even though Rome & Florence disappointed, I would definitely be game for eating my way through Emilia Romagna I’d still say that my culinary heart & stomach lies somewhere in Asia. Vietnam? Thailand? Japan? Taiwan? Singapore? Sri Lanka? All of the above! 😀 I really love the food in Thailand, Vietnam, and Taiwan as well, but I keep getting treated to the best food ever in Italy so it’s hard not to leave a piece of my “foodie heart” (I like the term!) there to revisit. Considering how expensive Europe is, that’s an amazing price for a food tour.  Couldn’t believe how many cheese wheels were in that room! I feel like this region is a well-kept secret and really cheap in comparison to the other parts of Italy I’ve been to. Not to mention, super duper delicious. This post makes me want to jump on a plane right now. I have been dreaming of a trip to Italy for years. Food, my budget and your blog brought me to northern Thailand in August and the food here is incredible. I now crave flavors, like kaffir lime, that just months ago I didn’t know existed. That’s wonderful! Yes, Northern Thailand is a foodie paradise as well, and so cheap! I was surprised by how affordable this part of Italy is, too. Excellent post!I thought you were taking a traveling hiatus? I took two months in Berlin, and now I’m back here, but I don’t think I’m capable of a hiatus. Things changed again and I realize there’s nothing holding me anywhere so I might as well keep moving. If Elizabeth Gilbert of “Eat Pray Love” can go to Italy to eat, why not others! It’s a good reason to visit Italy :-). We’ve read some good reviews about the Emilia Romagna area being a hotspot for foodies… I wasn’t even all that into food before I went. That’s how good the food there is! I agree with you. We have really good food in the US! It’s so international and delicious. It’s funny because my German friend requested cheese and caramel popcorn when I came back to Berlin from LA, because it’s a combination that “only Americans would think of”. I loved that. We get creative with our cuisine.  Oh man, though. Thai food. Yum! I Love to Travel and Eat…. I like to eat every Countries food…. Its my passion… Ncie Blog … I like your blog…… I visited Italy in 2007. I fell in love with the beauty of the country. I plan to visit Italy once more soon. This time with my wife. She is a pastry chef though. This time, it will be a real food experience!  Bologna rocks by the way. I still did not forget the spaghetti bolognese I had eaten there. On my first ever trip, interrailing with friends around Europe before university, we stopped in Bologna for lunch on our way south. And we ate… a MacDonalds. It breaks my heart now to think of it! Thanks for the gelato tips, duly saved in my Google Maps for whenever I go back to make up for the error of my ways. Sometimes you just want what you want!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/trekking-in-italy/,Pathways to the Lost Past in Italy,Italy,"“You might find this interesting because in Los Angeles you don’t have any piazzas,” Stefano, my trekking guide told me over morning cappuccino. Sitting in Vignola, a small town in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy, I felt transported back to a time when the center of social interaction was not a computer nor a smart phone, but an open space in the city center where after-dinner drinks, trade, most neighborly banter, and even public wealth displays took place daily. For thousands of years this was the case in small and large Italian towns alike.  It was a cultural staple steeped in tradition, but due to one dramatic and traumatic moment in history, nearly everything changed. Emilia Romagna in particular was quite poor prior to World War Two and was left quite war-ravaged by nazi occupation. Then, the economy skyrocketed due to the U.S. investment-induced post-war industrial revolution. This changed social structure from a mainly agricultural, communal culture where people would trade goods directly to what we now have in modern times — a culture where people work in offices and have the money to just buy bread at stores.  The personal interaction is erased since the purchase is made not from the individual who made the bread, but from an impersonal store shelf, most likely made by machine somewhere far away. Stefano can remember a time when his neighbors would get together to make bread in large batches, each bringing ingredients and sharing in the finished product.  He spoke about it with nostalgia, clearly preferring old times where food was made with natural ingredients and an element of trust was still there, as opposed to now when chemicals replace certain ingredients and conglomerates make our food. Yet, one of the last strongholds of this communal living still remains in Emilia Romagna.  There are still some autonomous communities on a small scale where everyone in the community still interacts and depends on each other. In the countryside towns dairy farmers sell fresh cheese to their neighbors, made organically with hormone-free cows. Artisans sell directly to the consumer down the road instead of through a middleman.  Steeped in tradition, this humanizes food and other items needed for daily life and fosters relationships more easily. Stefano brought all of this up to highlight the Importance of walking to conduct daily life.  The very trails we aimed to trek on that day are thousands of years old – some even pre-Christ.  There are still traces of civilization from back then along the walking paths today. It is no surprise to see people regularly waving and saying hello to each other in these small towns.  There’s an element of openness and friendliness that is missing from large megatropolises like New York, for example, where people are more sealed off to interaction with each other. Just being in this area and wandering these hills creates a feeling of going back several hundred years because everything is still on a smaller scale the way it used to be. There are no mega farms or conglomerates and there are literally thousands of walking paths that people still use today in the way that they have for countless generations. I really felt transported back to those ancient times, traveling through hills where ancient life and modern times intersect. The other fascinating aspect was the natural diversity and constantly changing micro climates, the same thing that had me so enamored with New Zealand.  With so many trails there’s tons of variety. The big selling point for me, of course, is the lack of other tourists.  One could walk for days and not encounter another one. Sadly, we didn’t get much opportunity to test them out given the heavy rains, but I still very much enjoyed being transported back in time. Thanks to Stefano and Trekking Italy Emilia Romagna for hosting me via Blogville Emilia Romagna. It was a day I won’t soon forget.  I’ll take the wheel of cheese! Thanks for sharing this post!Mike I will too. Yum! I loved reading it! I have a fascination for Italy and so, reading about its growth and changes over the ages is even more intriguing. I have a fascination with Italy too now! Hi everyone, I originally am from the region and now live in the dolmites Always in I taly. I can guarantee you it is exactly as written ifnot even more,,especially in the small villages..it is a jewel not yet discovered…then move North dirction Austria and stop in Trentino, target the val di fiemme area..it is a slice of paradise.ciaoAlberto Emilia Romagna is very lovely in fact I’m moving there, but I think you should check out even the south of Italy, especially Sicily ,it has some very beautiful and stunning places but it’s sadly unknown by many. If you don’t believe me just google “Agrigento temples” or “scala dei turchi”. They are treasure known by fewMartina I agree! I want to see it all! Italy is such a nice country. I have been there twice but I realize how little I have seen so far. Each and every corner of it worth to see. I think I have great tips about my next visit. Thank you for giving great tips about off the beaten path in Italy. Truely wonderful! How many days have you spent in Italy, and how much was the total cost? Thanks! I’ve been back 4 times so now it’s been a total of about a month and a half. Cost depends on the region, with South Tyrol costing more than Bologna, for example. Italy is not a budget destination, though. You can save by camping or staying in hostels.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/off-the-beaten-path-italy/,"Bologna, the Gem of Italy",Italy,"“How about a motorbike tour of the city?” he offered.  It was a warm evening and the cobble-stoned streets were lined with twinkling lights, young Friday night party revelers, college coeds, and couples with hands intertwined, enjoying all that the city had to offer.  It reminded me in some ways of my college town, where everyone hung out as if in one cohesive group, bringing a warmth and energy to our small city that is rare to find elsewhere. “Absolutely,” I replied.  Riding a motorbike on a warm night has quickly become one of my favorite things. — I have to be honest, when I think about “my place” in the world, almost nowhere in Europe really comes to mind.  I feel very at home in Asia and I never have been able to discern why.  I guess it was just the friendliness of locals in the small towns, the natural beauty, and the innate cultural warmness and inclusiveness that tends to be present in so many places in Asia.  I thought it just had to do with the difference in Eastern vs. Western culture, and figured the rest of the world simply lacked that kind of warmth. Then I came to Bologna in Emilia Romagna, Italy, and realized that it has all of that and more. In the past, the various places in Europe haven’t really given me that welcoming feeling, but I understand why now: I was always firmly on the tourist trail. Off the beaten path travel is all about finding smaller towns – places that haven’t yet been overrun by tourism and don’t leave locals feeling exhausted by the occasional bad egg.   Bologna, and especially the smaller surrounding towns, like Modena and Nonantola, truly felt different to me.  I don’t know how else to explain it or put my finger on it, but places are always about the people, and the people just seemed really nice in this part of Italy. Included in this group is Francesco, a med student in Bologna whom I had met via couchsurfing.  He takes pride in both his cooking ability (and rightly so) and hospitality.  He delights in taking visitors around Bologna, showing them the awesome street art and historical sights. He knows every little secret of the city – things that a guide book can’t tell you.  It’s experiences like this, hanging out with locals, that always really make a place for me. “It feels really safe here,” I said to him.  It was 1am and the streets were still bustling with young people, running around, laughing, and enjoying the warm evening. “At least 120,000 students live in Bologna,” he replied me, “almost every family has someone here, so it has to be safe.” It made sense.  I didn’t walk around clutching my bag, scared of being pick-pocketed like I was in Rome.  I didn’t get practically bowled over by hoards of people like I did in Florence, and I didn’t have rude men cat calling after me here like I did in Sorrento. I felt completely alright walking around by myself, walking around at night, and trusting my intuition which told me that things there were different, in a good way. I went to Italy with no expectations and left with a heavy heart, because it really captivated me. Europe definitely warrants a deeper exploration, so I think I’ll stick around this continent a bit longer than originally planned and see what other beautiful gems it may hold. *Thanks to Blogville in Emilia Romagna for helping me rediscover Italy. I was a guest of theirs but all opinions are my own.  bless you Kris ^_^ thanks for sharing your world and for these warm words! there will be always a big hug and some decent dishes waiting for you in Bologna! Love you Francesco! seems like a place not to be missed in Italy! This is going to be added into my to-visit place in Italy! Sounds like Bologna is one of those European gems you’re glad you’ve explored. And like a local! We’ve got Le Marche on our mind – dubbed “the next Tuscany” but said to be less touristy. OOooh sounds worth checking out! I love that you mentioned Francesco – he was also part of my Bologna experience + someone I keep in touch with, and is truly fabulous (as is his gorgeous city)! You’re kidding! He’s awesome. Kris! Have you ever been to Livorno? I think it’s close-ish to Bolognia so I thought you might, anyways your blog helped me get over my fear and I’m going in January to be an au pair XD that’s awesome! No I’ve never been there but I haven’t found a part of Italy I don’t like so I’m keen to keep exploring. Such great news you took the leap. Keep in touch and let me know how it goes!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/teamlab-borderless-tokyo-guide/,How to Maximize Your teamLab Borderless Tokyo Experience,Japan,"If you enjoy art museums, interactive science museums, pretty lights, music, or the pleasing effect of symmetry, the Mori Building Digital Art Museum Epson teamLab Borderless (what a mouthful!) delivers. teamLab is a consortium of artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians, architects and graphic designers. They pool their talents to create interactive works of magic straddling the line between the beautiful, the captivating, and the technology needed to create it.  teamLab has two installations in Tokyo: Planets and Borderless. This article covers the Borderless museum at the Mori building, more than 10,000 square meters with digital art that’s constantly changing, morphing, and interacting with spectators. I visited in October 2018 and these are my best tips for getting the most out of it:  Word has gotten out about how amazing this place is and like most famous works of art, it is popular. In most cases, you’ll need to buy tickets ahead of time or risk them being sold out on the day that you want to go. Tickets cost ¥3200 per person and can be purchased here.  I spent about four hours exploring the exhibits at teamLab and had I not been so jetlagged, I probably would’ve stayed for even longer. Each room constantly changes and might be a completely different experience at one time of day than another. Part of this is because of who might be in there and how you might interact, and how the colors and sounds change in each room. Whether you go in early, right after it opens, or later in the afternoon, allow yourself at least a few hours to see all of the exhibits and to not feel rushed. As of now opening times are: Mon – Thu 10:00- 19:00Fri, Sat & Holiday Eves 10:00- 21:00Sun & Holidays 10:00- 20:00 *Last entry 1 hour before the museum closing time.*EN TEA HOUSE opens 1 hour after the museum door opens. Last order is 30 min before closing.*Hours may vary depending on the season.*Closed on the 2nd & 4th Tuesdays of the month.  Many of the famous photos that you might have seen of teamLab Borderless with only one or two people in the photo were taken by teamLab itself. Make peace with the fact that there will be people in your photos. If you do see a short line for one of the more popular exhibits, and you’ll know because there will be a queue set up, go in while the getting is good! I was also unsure of how best to time my entry to the building. I went close to opening time and stayed until the early afternoon. In an email from teamLab on the day of my visit, they suggested coming after 2 PM in order to have smaller crowds or to spend less time waiting in line.  You can encounter lines entering the building for up to 90 minutes or in queues to enter the more popular exhibits. That said, Google told a different story as I scrolled through for the popular times. So basically, plan on sharing the experience with others no matter when you go, although if you wait until closing you might be able to get one or two photos without others in them. Although you will be exploring with plenty of people, I found that Japanese culture is polite and not pushy, which made it a more pleasant experience. teamLab also encourages seeing other people as part of the art. In an interview with designboom, they say that unlike in a traditional museum where being alone is a blessing, in Borderless you may pay more attention to the action of the viewer next to you, since the art is interactive, than you would looking at a traditional painting. teamLab wants visitors to experience the art together and to interact with it both individually and as a group. They view this as an important unifying factor both of art and of the effect of people living in cities. If only there were interactive art all over the subways and crowded streets, perhaps we play with each other a bit more! Also, make sure you eat beforehand. Apart from a tea room, there is no food or drink at the museum. There are little rest areas with vending machines but that’s about it. Make sure you eat before you go!  In the video above, I take you through each room and each sensory experience. Below I’ve listed each place so that you can make sure you don’t miss anything! These dazzling lights look like falling crystallized rain, constantly changing colors and framed with mirrors on the walls and floor. Spend some time in here and wander through the corners and you just might get lucky and find a spot where you can get a photo without too many other people! This is the most popular exhibit and the only one with a time limit when I went. The lightbulbs change color if you come near them, and the whole room goes from yellow to pink to blue. About 30 people are let in at a time and only for a minute, and you may wait for about 20 to 40 minutes to get into this one.  This will probably be the first room that you come into. There are little standing rooms within this giant room with additional installations inside, but the main feature are the flowers that are blooming, wilting, and sprouting up as you step on and tap on them.  I really liked this experience, drinking the blooming tea and watching as the pedals scattered as I drank more. There’s an additional charge for this one of ¥500 which allows you to select from an array of green teas (I picked Yuzu).  First this room starts off with stalks high above your head and the sounds and colors change to symbolize the different seasons. As you walk through the room you can come above the rice paddy. The combination of lights and music in here were so beautiful I almost cried. It may have had to do with my extreme exhaustion from flying all night but it was beautiful just the same. This reminded me of the famous Japanese waves painting, animated and come to life. It’s calming and stormy at the same time. There are some pillows in the middle of the room if you need to take a load off.  If you want to double over from the cuteness overload head to the Athletics Forest and watch the kids interact by jumping on the trampolines and stomping on the flowers. You’ll see flowery humpback whales swimming by under your feet and across the walls. You can also find some exhibits to climb on and a little drawing area too.  Just through the Athletics Forest you’ll see these floating balloons which reminded me of little hot air balloons of various sizes.  While each room is interactive, the hallways are tons of fun, too. There are marching bunnies and flower animals on the walls, most of which are interactive as well, so hop along with them and touch them. This double decker art show is visible from a net suspended in what seems like the middle of time and space. Lie down and watch as the lights and sounds swirl above underneath and around you.  To feel like you’re in a nightclub of lasers, head into this room and dance! If you get lost, connect to the free Wi-Fi and load the pictures from this article to show to the attendants and they will point you in the right direction. As you go through the exhibits it will become clear why they don’t want tripods, selfie sticks or big backpacks – some of them have narrow areas and for some you’ll be climbing, jumping, and walking through hanging lights. I was a little bit bummed that I couldn’t bring a tripod since I was there alone and wanted to get some photos with me in them, but I was able to use the mirrors for selfies, and in a couple of cases was able to ask someone nearby to take my picture for me. Problem solved! Thankfully teamLab borderless at the MORI building is easy to find. Get off the train at the Aomi stop and turn left as you exit the train. You’ll see a mall with a Starbucks downstairs and the Toyota showroom to your right. Walk through the showroom and you’ll soon come to the entrance of the exhibit. I hope this guide helps you to enjoy the experience at the Mori Building Digital Art Museum Epson teamLab Borderless (say that ten times fast. I’ll wait). If so come back and let us know! Woah I didn’t know this place existed! What a cool thing! That’s such a Japan thing lol There are some similar exhibits in Singapore and there was in LA too! They often travel. Such a stunning photos! It seems unrealistic but I know it’s real. Thank you for sharing your travel blog. It makes me travel and discovers the world too. Thank you for sharing! I’ve already purchased my tickets! May I know how long did you have to wait when you went near opening time at 10am? I more or less got right in. Each day will differ I’m sure. Tips on the camera set up please… if you use dslr and smartphone cam Here ya go https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-take-travel-selfies/ I loved the music in the rooms, most of all during nest room.  Do you happen to know what its called or a possible soundtrack? Oh dear I don’t know anymore but maybe you can Shazaam it? I just visited today, it was great! A couple of tips: Definitely go early, and ignore the email that says go around 2pm. I arrived at 10am on a Monday and we waited maybe 20 mins to get in. I’d say try to get there at 9:45am. We were able to get inside the first doors in just a few minutes. When we left at almost 3pm the line was outside and wrapped around the building, probably over an hour wait. This article doesn’t actually tell you how to optimize visiting the top locations first. When you first go in, DON’T go upstairs to the athletic forest. If you find yourself there turn around and go back to a different room. Do the nest or the floating lamps as soon as you can. We found the lamps maybe an hour in and were able to go twice waiting < 15mins each time. We didn't find the nest until much later and waited over an hour. You don't necessarily have to make a beeline for these, part of the experience is discovering new rooms as you wander about and skipping them takes away some of the fun. But try to do them within the first hour. The nest is on the right side of the big flower forest room that you first enter into if you have trouble finding it. The floating lamps I can't say exactly… it's more towards the middle and up some stairs I think. The crystal room is also nice but has more capacity so you don't have to wait long to get in. Finally, I don't suggest waiting more than 30-40 minutes for the nest, as you can still see the same show, but standing up, at the cave thing. When you make it into the nest though then try to get a spot towards the middle (subjective, but I think that's more immersive). Don't forget to look to the sides and down though at least once. How funny, I didn’t wait for the nest at all in the mid-afternoon! The hanging lamps might be good to find first, though. I spent a long time looking for those! It’s such a maze in there. Thankyou for your post! It really helps me since I’ll go there alone too. I’m a little surprised to see there are no other people in your photos. Are there tips for getting photos like that? Thank you! For the most part I just waited it out until the moment when I could manage it. In the forest of resonating lamps it’ll be a matter of angle. Do you know if there were storage lockers for larger luggage? Perhaps you can email them first to ask because my locker was pretty small. The lockers only fit a medium size backpack! I didn’t see any larger size lockers. Maybe the closest place with larger lockers would be at the train station close by There are 100yen refundable lockers that can fit a backpack, but i also saw  many big luggages secured  to a long ‘handrail’ in the locker area. Your blog looks really amazing, thank you so much for sharing! Do you know by any chance if they have a giftshop? And if they ship their book? I am dying to have their book.. it is so inspiring! Keep up your amazing work,  love it Hmm, I never went to any gift shop but it seems like it would be a good idea for them to have one. Is the book not available online? Unfortunately I didn’t have enough time to visit TeamLab will have to return, heard it is amazing !Great post !  I just purchased tickets to the museum but without the Tea House option.  Will we still be able to purchase the tea while we are there? Yes that’s what I did! We had high expectations since we had heard and seen so much about the space and the exhibits. Being Graphic Designers ourselves, we were mostly disappointed and unimpressed.  ‘The Crystal World’ was immersive, ‘Memory of Topography’ was an interesting play of scale and props, ‘Light Shell & Light Vortex’ was impressive in it’s use of light coordination and synchronisation.  However, these alone did not redeem the overall experience, which was lacklustre and unimaginative. The scale and technical capacity of the project is impressive, however we were let down by the simplistic, repetitive and mostly meaningless content of the computer generated graphics. The motion graphics in most of the areas were like glorified screen-savers projected on to a large canvas. Their interactive capabilities were limited, predictable and dumbed down and in many spaces, where each individuals presence was supposed to affect the artwork, the interaction could not be experienced due to the constant presence of a hundred people at a time. After waiting in line for 45 minutes to see ‘Floating Nest’, we were terribly disappointed by a massive immersive screen space wasted with more meaningless computer graphics. It could have been sensational but the grandiose concepts are lost in translation. The only saving grace was that we got there at 9am and didn’t have to wait in line for most exhibits.  Borderless is a good photo-op for selfie lovers, only looks good in pictures, and is overrated. Aw I couldn’t disagree more! I loved it and spent most of the day there! You missed the butterfly room Is that at Teamlab Borderless? I didn’t see it on their website either. Hi may i know how long approx you finished walked around inside teamlab ? I am going to Tokyo this March and would like to plan my journey to Teamlab when I visit there I spent about half the day there but you can easily do longer or shorter.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-wear-in-japan/,What to Wear in Japan,Japan,"Japan is famous worldwide for its unique style, especially the fashionistas of Harajuku in Tokyo. That said, before I went to Japan I failed to consider that not everyone, everywhere, is into the bright and quirky style of Harajuku, so with that in mind, we’ve combined the quirky and the practical for these packing lists. We’ve got you covered for what to wear in Japan whatever the season:  Temperature and humidity in Japan begins to increase as it welcomes summer from June to August. The locals tend to dress up in lightweight, breezy clothes that keep things nice and cool without exposing too much skin. Short skirts and pants are totally fine, but you may want to avoid showing cleavage! That being said, do not shy away from embracing your personal style when in Japan – I saw some of the most fashionable people in the streets of Tokyo, and it’s so cool to see everyone go all out with their creativity and get inspired! You will see what I mean when you get there. Expect lots of fun, outdoor festivals, more rain in May and June, and the hottest months of the year in July and August. With that in mind, here’s a summer packing list for a week in Japan:   Fall is a lovely time to visit Japan. It’s slightly less crowded than the popular springtime, you will see beautiful fall foliage in parks and countryside, and the weather is pleasant all around, if not slightly chilly, which makes walking outside an enjoyable experience. Especially in early fall, the weather can be quite confusing – one day it’s almost too hot and sunny, the next day it’s chilly enough to wear a jacket. Similar to spring, layering is key so bring clothes that work well with each other. It’s a good time to rent a set of kimono, which can be too hot in the summer, and immerse yourself in the traditional Japanese culture for the day, especially if you are in places like Kyoto. I also noticed many local women rocking lots of bright color wide-leg pants during this time of the year and thought they looked appropriate, stylish and comfy! Here’s a fall packing list for a week in Japan:  Depending on which part of Japan you are traveling to, winter in Japan can get pretty cold. Temperatures can go below freezing in the north, whereas in Tokyo, you can expect 40°F – 55°F, with a slight chance of snow. Most indoor places and public transportation have heating systems in place to keep warm, which means you will have to deal with the constant fluctuation in temperatures. Again, layering is key as you’ll want to be able to keep your body temperature at a comfortable state to avoid getting sick. I wouldn’t sweat too much on packing for a winter trip to Japan – Uniqlo has some really amazing yet affordable options, and their stores are everywhere! Here’s what you should pack for a week in Japan during the winter:  If you are going on a ski trip up north, check out my ski trip packing list!  If you are visiting Japan during the cherry blossom season, layering is important, as the indoors are warm but it could still get slightly chilly outside. You will be out visiting the shrines, walking through beautiful local neighborhoods, and enjoying authentic local cuisine at restaurants and cafes, so expect to be walking a lot. You are also likely to participate in Hanami (cherry blossom viewing) so as far as clothing goes, I’d recommend planning a wardrobe that’s lightweight, fashionable, and pastel. It will go well with the cherry blossoms and spring colors. As mentioned above, leave room in your luggage as you can find cool things from the malls and local thrift shops. With that in mind, here’s a spring packing list for a week in Japan:    I hope these lists help you to worry less about what to wear in Japan and spend more time enjoying it! Though my style tends to be more colorful and quirky than most, these lists are a great place to start regardless of your personal style. This is so helpful!  Thanks a million!!! ❤️❤️❤️ Yay I’m glad! Hi where did you get those flowery overalls?? love them! Black Milk Clothing 🙂 Hi, if I’m planning a 3 weeks in Japon for November. How much clothes do I need to bring? Thanks in advance I like to do a week or so and wash clothing.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tsurutokame-tokyo/,Tsurutokame: The Only All-Female Kaiseki Restaurant in Tokyo,Japan,"The chef poured the sake into my host’s glass until it spilled over the brim and into a curved bowl at the base. Though clearly intentional, it was a gesture I had never seen before. When I asked why, I was told that abundance and the possibility of more is always welcome, and who can argue with that? As a perfect mirror to this, abundance is the inspiration behind the name of Tsurutokame, which translates to crane and turtle. The animals symbolize longevity and luck, and after experiencing the culinary delight of Tsurutokame I have no question that both are in the cards for this all-female run restaurant in the high-end Ginza District of Tokyo.  So what makes this restaurant so special? Apart from the fact that it is one of the best dining experiences one can have in Tokyo, it is completely run by a team of seven female chefs serving a Kaiseki traditional multi-course dinner. This is the epitome of Japanese haute cuisine and is considered the highest-level genre of restaurant in Japan. Kaiseki is not just a meal, it is an art form. To fully appreciate why this restaurant is so cutting edge, let’s look at the glass ceiling that women are up against in this profession, particularly in Japan. When the Wall Street Journal asked Yoshikazu Ono, son of famed sushi chef Jiro from the documentary, Jiro Dreams of Sushi, why women can’t be sushi chefs, he answered, “it is because women menstruate.” Menstruation apparently causes an imbalance in one’s ability to taste. Another popular myth is that women have a “higher core body temperature”, and that wearing makeup and perfume affects our sense of smell. Right. Due to these false beliefs, it is rare to see a female sushi or Kaiseki chef at all, and almost unheard of to see a woman leading a kitchen in a reputable restaurant in Japan. This is what the chefs of Tsurutokame are up against, and yet they’re successful despite the odds. Harumi Mikuni, and her husband, Osamu Mikuni, are seasoned restauranteurs and the driving force behind Tsurutokame with a 100% female-only kitchen. It’s the couple’s brilliant way to grow talented women into leaders and earn their spot in a male-dominant industry. When asked why they didn’t simply place a female chef at the helm of one of their other 10 restaurants, they said that male chefs are unlikely to respect a female as a lead chef. Therefore, the only way is for the rest of the chefs working under her to be female as well.  However the couple believes in the possibilities and talents of female chefs, and this restaurant is an experiment to see if women can find their place in Japan’s elite culinary scene. In an interview with Forbes, Mikuni said, “My husband and I have always felt that women, while lower in the eyes of society and always behind the scenes, can perform well or same or even better than men.” Based on the popularity of the restaurant and the often months-long waitlist, their experiment seems to be working. The chefs of Tsurutokame, led by 35-year-old head chef, Yubako Kamohara, are all being groomed by the Mikunis – not only as chefs, but as well-rounded human beings. They live together, shop for ingredients in the mornings, prep together, go on field trips to study languages and art, and work together on a daily basis to curate the menu of the day, which in true Kaiseki style, changes every night.  In typical Kaiseki style guests have a front row seat to the action. The restaurant is set up as a long bar with chairs all around it which accommodates up to 14 guests. During the entirety of the multi course meal, diners have the opportunity to observe and even speak with the chefs. One of my favorite things about this restaurant was how interactive, approachable, warm, and friendly the women were. The experience is exclusive and intimate. Yubako Kamohara, the lead chef, seemed to be leading an orchestra. Behind the kitchen counter opposite me was Kamohara, who was working her hands on the tuna whilst chit chatting with the guests as well as directing the rest of the kitchen simultaneously. The restaurant has a light, easeful energy, and instead of feeling slightly intimidated in the presence of the chefs, I feel welcomed into their personal kitchen. Now let’s talk about the food, which I’m still salivating over. The menu is varied and seasonal, only using the freshest ingredients. I went in October, and experienced plates with offerings and adornments including autumn leaves, several kinds of seaweed, fresh fish, edible flowers, and tofu in just about every form imaginable. The food is as inventive and inspired as it is delicious. The chefs also completely adopted a vegan menu for me while serving the rest of the restaurant their traditional menu. They put just as much effort into my food as everyone else’s and it really showed. This alone blows me away, since many high-level chefs will simply refuse a vegan diner or any kind of special order. The cuisine was a mixture of textures and flavors I couldn’t have previously imagined. Each dish had so many layers that it kept surprising, offering a different mix with every scoop of my chopsticks. Each bite was a new experience by design. Imagine tofu that tastes like cream cheese, tuna that looks and tastes like beef tartare (according to my friend who had the omnivore’s menu), seaweed with the consistency of panna cotta, aromatic flowers to complement a bite here and there, and a traditional matcha green tea finish. It’s a symphony of textures and flavors that each have their place in the dishes, and it’s clear every detail has been thought of. Additionally, in contrast to much of the world’s fine dining, it was high cuisine that was healthy without even trying – a byproduct of the fresh ingredients and the very nature of Japanese cuisine. I’m happy to report that this restaurant is doing incredibly well, with a mixture of both male and female guests all enjoying the food and the atmosphere. With the aim to prove that women can be capable chefs, Tsurutokame delivers in spades. While genuine Kaiseki is an experience that’s unique to Japan, Tsurutokame is an experience that’s unique to Tokyo’s Ginza neighborhood and truly one of a kind. Since it’s so popular, it’s best to book seats as early as you know you’ll be in Tokyo. I was told by our host, Ayako Yuki, that spaces book out up to a month in advance. Part of this is due to how economical the experience is at only 10,000¥ to 16,000¥, which is unheard of for Kaiseki, as well as how varied the menu is. Regular guests keep coming back because the experience is so different each time. To book your spot, visit the website here.  I was beyond inspired by this experience. It felt so incredibly unique and special – and it is. If you’re in Tokyo treat yourself to Tsurutokame. Support these amazing women who are living proof that anything the boys do, we can do just as well (or better). *In the spirit of full disclosure, I was invited to be a guest of Tsurutokame, however I was not asked to provide a favorable review. The thoughts shared here are genuine and reflect my personal experience.  Hi Kristin: This is a great find. Several interesting things mentioned here, some unfortunate. First, society pushes that women “belong in the kitchen” and “cook and clean” and then when there is cooking outside in a restaurant, especially prestigious ones, they are “not good enough” or the work is too “strenuous” (being a chef requires standing an insane amount of time and 70+ hours of work per week) or they have a period. Some say it is about women taking care of the family but the truth comes out in articles like the Wall Street Journal (about control and prejudice). It is great that things are changing here not only in Japan but around many places in the world, more power to you all and to those hard working female chefs! Still some way to go in the U.S. for instance. I love how they treat their employees like a loving family at this restaurant. The other things is about this post is about the cross cultural similarities, showing how we are truly much more alike than different. For instance, “The chef poured the sake into my host’s glass until it spilled over the brim and into a curved bowl at the base.”  In Judaism, it is traditional before a festive meal especially, to fill your wine glass/cup past full and let it spill into the bowl to celebrate the overflow of joy and abundance.  On the flip side of the coin, the use of menstruation to exclude women from certain activities is also quite universal in terms of it as an excuse cross-culturally. In some cases blood is impure therefore women can’t participate in some religious ritual or even enter a religious sanctuary even if not in that part of the cycle. In some religious viewpoints, Eve is blamed for tempting Adam with the “apple” and menstruation was a punishment for sin so therefore a bad thing instead of part of the natural way of things. Thank goodness a lot of this is dropping off and proper interpretation of religious texts are replacing this nonsense! And apparently Yoshikazu and other chefs not just in Japan have another reason! Explain me this: If someone’s taste buds are off is an issue for a great chef why are there great head chefs out there that I have heard of that NEVER TASTE THE FOOD THEY PREPARE :).  One quick question: When they prepared your vegan meal, did they have the vegan food touch an area that ever gets cooked with meat? That would be an issue with me. I actually would eat certain fish, being pescetarian, but same issue. It sounds like to me they are so nice and compassionate that they would accommodate but curious how they handled it for you since the usually cook everything on those tables in front of you. They had tools to prevent cross contact in one Japanese restaurant here in my hometown (although when traveling I sometimes find vegan/vegetarian restaurants of this type), but wanted to know your experience. Thanks! I watched the viGGdeo, it was very informative. I have never experienced any Japanese restaurant like that. It appears that they could accommodate anyone if they wanted to in this manner so no need to answer my question, the video took care of it. I encourage people to watch the video, it was neat to see and made me quite hungry. The lead chef’s smile was precious and the joy/satisfaction in your and Ashley’s faces makes me want to go there if I ever get to Tokyo. Hope this isn’t just a novelty and breaks barriers in terms of chefs and other professions in general. Hi, nicely done and written, always great to find new information in your blog . so useful and practical for me. Woow. Great.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-do-in-tokyo/,"The Best of What to Do in Tokyo, Japan",Japan,"Tokyo is easily one of the most captivating cities in the world with its advanced technology, unique culture, and delicious cuisine. From themed robot cafes to the blooming Sakura trees to the digital teamLab museum, there’s so much to do in Tokyo it can be tough figuring out where to start. This guide has some of the best things to do in Tokyo, broken down into categories including the delicious, the cultural experiences, and the weird and amazing: Tucked away in the streets of Ginza, Tsurutokame is unlike any other Japanese restaurant you have heard of. The restaurant is the only all-female Kaiseki restaurant in Tokyo, led by 7 amazing chefs aged 18-35. In true Kaiseki style, the multi-course menu changes daily. More than just an excellent restaurant, Tsurutokame is a movement that aims to shake up the male-dominated restaurant scene in Japan. It has gained well-deserved popularity, with regular guests coming back for more. Since it’s so popular, it’s best to book seats as early as you know you’ll be in Tokyo. The experience only costs 10,000¥ to 16,000¥, which is almost unheard of for Kaiseki.  If you like bright colors, Alice in Wonderland-esque design themes, and macarons bigger than your head, then you absolutely must pop in to the Kawaii (translation: cute) monster cafe. There are four different sections, including the Mushroom Disco, Milk Stand, Bar Experiment, and Mel-Tea Room. Each is a whole new world to explore, with unique decorations that make for interesting photo ops. I visited at lunch time on a weekday and was able to get a table after 10 minutes. You can also make a reservation on their official website. Entry costs 500¥ and each guest must buy at least one dish and one drink. The food is a lot more about looks than flavor so do manage your expectations. Read more: 10 Quirky Things to do in Harajuku, Tokyo Michelin awarded Chef Yoshihiro Narisawa serves his unique kind of innovative Satoyama-inspired cuisine at this Tokyo institution. Narisawa has been included in the list of the best restaurants in the world several years running. The set menu showcases the satoyama scenery of Japan with forests reaching out to the sea and has interesting dishes like the self-raising forest bread, which is “cooked” on the table as you savor the amouse-bouche. Every dish on the menu is made of entirely local ingredients from all parts of Japan, and their specific origins are listed on the menu. The food can be paired with one of hundreds of sake bottles or wine. – Mar of Once in a Lifetime Journey Eating street food in Tokyo is not really a thing, as eating food on the street is considered rude in Japan. However, Sunamachi, a pedestrian shopping street in Koto Ward, is one of the few places in town where eating on the street is commonplace. Sunamachi is also known as side-dish street, as it is lined with food shops and stalls selling food that is traditionally enjoyed as a side dish with rice, like tempura, pickled vegetables, yakitori, and even unusual specialties like oden (pictured above) which is skewers of tofu and vegetables in a light soy and dashi broth. – Margherita of The Crowded Planet If you’re hungry in Tokyo, head straight to the former Tsukiji fish market where there a dozens of street stalls and small cafés with an abundance of tasty treats. The famous tuna auction may have moved to Toyoso, but the bustling market atmosphere remains at the old outer market site. Must tries: The freshest sushi, sea urchins eaten straight out of the shell, and delicious wasabi tempura crab sticks. – Katy of Untold Morsels  While most of Japan is going through a coffee renaissance, you can soak up older Tokyo culture at a traditional kissaten, a style of coffee shop that became popular decades before Starbucks reached the west. For one of the most classic, I would most recommend Cafe de l’Ambre – never mind the western name! – which was established in 1948 in Ginza. Their specialty is aged coffees, some of which are from the 1970s, and whose prices can exceed 1,000 yen a cup. These kissaten have the genteel atmosphere of an old club, with wood and leather furniture, and coffee makers dressed formally and behaving like sommeliers. The best part is that the owner of Cafe de l’Ambre, Ichiro, Sekiguchi, who founded it in 1948, can still be seen roasting coffee, even though he’s over 100 years old! – Dana of Discover Discomfort  The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo is situated in the infamous area of Kabuchiko in Shinjuku. From the moment you step into the building, you will be met with glittery walls and neon colors everywhere. Here awaits a neon-colored display with robots, dancers, ninjas, warriors and, and beyond. For 90 minutes, you get the show of a lifetime where robotic machines are fighting each other, dragons are spitting out real fire, and ninjas are swinging their swords while the audience is swinging their glowsticks. I recommend buying tickets before you go, because it’s a very popular show, and tickets usually sell out. There are 3 daily shows, and the earliest one is usually not sold out during weekdays. It’s also possible to buy last minute tickets at the door if there are some available. – Alex of Swedish Nomad  The Pokemon Cafe, located right next to the largest Pokemon Center in Tokyo, has taken the Pikachu experience to the max. As you enter, the themed cafe is decorated from top to bottom with everything Pokemon. There is a soft Snorlax snoozing on a shelf, a TV with Pokemon cartoons, as well as pictures and statues galore. The digital menu, with an English option, is easy to use, however trying to choose between pancakes, curry, or pasta is much more difficult. Every dish is decorated with Pikachu or another character. The cafe is located in the Nihonbashi area of Tokyo where there are lots of museums, shops, and parks, so it’s easy to stop in for a lunch or sweet snack! – Corinne of Reflections Enroute.  Café de Miki with Hello Kitty offers a whimsical dining experience centered around the popular Japanese cartoon character, Hello Kitty. The café, which is located inside Diver City Shopping Mall, is the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or breakfast for dinner. The décor inside the restaurant and even the food is fun and Hello Kitty-themed. If you are visiting Tokyo with kids, they will especially enjoy getting to dine with the lovable kitten, as every table has a large plush Hello Kitty toy that sits next to you while you eat. – Melissa of Parenthood and Passports  If you’ve ever been a Sanrio store, you’ve probably seen the famous character “Pompompurin”. It’s one of the cutest anime characters, and in Tokyo, one could visit his own cafe. In the middle of Takeshita Street in Harajuku, you’ll find the adorable Pompompurin Cafe. Here you can enjoy a delicious Ice cream that looks like Pompompurin or various other themed dishes with Purin and his friends. The whole place is really cute. The food is quite nice, but of course, you come here for the themed experience and not primarily for the quality of food. Prices are reasonable as well and all in all, I can heartily recommend this cute little anime cafe. – Christine of Christine Abroad  We loved visiting Shinjuku Gyoen during spring, a huge park that’s like an urban oasis in the middle of Tokyo during sakura (cherry blossom) season. You can see hundreds of trees with over 12 different varieties of blossoms all blooming with delicate pink and white petals. Another bonus when visiting at this time of year is watching the tradition of hanami, where groups of Japanese families, friends and colleagues celebrate the arrival of spring under the cherry blossom trees with picnics and songs. – Kylie of Our Overseas Adventures When staying in Tokyo you must visit Yoyogi Park. It’s a great opportunity to flee from the hustle and bustle of the big city and relax a little bit in peaceful nature. On the weekends, you can find many local families here and children playing all over the park. That’s what we loved so much about this place – While many other parks in Tokyo feel rather like a tourist attraction, the Yoyogi Park has a much more authentic and local vibe. The best time to visit this beautiful park is around spring or summer when it is comfortably warm outside or, of course, during the cherry blossom season. – Vicki of Vicki Viaja Just behind the hustle and bustle of Harajuku, an ancient little temple sits in the middle of a peaceful park oasis. Dedicated to Emperor Meiji and his Empress, who rules in the late 1800s, this shrine is beautifully maintained and a a great way to learn more about Japanese culture. Out the front of the shrine you can leave a wish on a tablet and hang it around a tree which will be offered in the morning ceremony, called the Mikesai, the following day. – Emma of Explore Shaw  Senso-ji is an ancient Buddhist temple located in the Asakusa neighbourhood of Tokyo. While the temples vibrant colors and towering pagodas are stunning to see, what I loved most about visiting Senso-ji was watching the locals come to pray and throw coins in exchange for a prayer or wish. As one of the oldest and most significant religious sites in Japan, a visit to Senso-ji should be on your list of things to do when you’re in Tokyo. – Lora of Explore with Lora  Watching sumo wrestling at a professional sumo tournament is one of the most unique and interesting things you can do in Tokyo.  Sumo is considered Japan’s national sport and watching a sumo tournament is exciting, especially since the crowd is very passionate about the matches. In addition to being a sporting event, sumo is also a fascinating cultural experience as the matches include many ancient Japanese rituals and traditions such as singing and foot stomping. Tokyo hosts three professional sumo tournaments at the Ryogoku Kokugikan arena each year (in January, May and September) each lasting fifteen days.  Tickets go on sale more than a month in advance of the first day and you can buy them online from the official website. – Matilda of The Travel Sisters  For hundreds of years, traditional Kabuki has been performed on prominent stages across Japan. I loved being overwhelmed by the over-the-top costumes and makeup on the performers, who were traditionally male. Don’t forget to bring a bento box for the lunch intermission. – Halef of The Round The World Guys “There are numerous kimono rental shops as well as places that sell kimonos in Asakusa. As an older part of Tokyo with the historic Senso-ji, this is the ideal place to put on the traditional garments and roam the streets like it’s the 19th or 20th century. It also makes for great photos! If you are visiting during the hotter months, I recommend asking for a yukata, the summer version of kimono, instead. It has fewer layers and looks pretty similar. – Nam of Laugh Travel Eat  If you enjoy art museums, interactive science museums, pretty lights, music, or the pleasing effect of symmetry, the Mori Building Digital Art Museum Epson teamLab Borderless (what a mouthful!) delivers. teamLab is a consortium of artists, programmers, engineers, CG animators, mathematicians, architects and graphic designers. They pool their talents to create interactive works of magic straddling the line between the beautiful, the captivating, and the technology needed to create it. Book your tickets online from their official website in advance, and budget lots of time for this amazing experience. Blog post: How to Maximize Your teamLab Borderless Tokyo Experience  At any of the MariCar shops in Tokyo, one can dress up as a Mario Brothers character and take a red go-kart for a spin. It’s a quick and fun way to see the city because the tours pass tourist attractions such as Shibuya Crossing, Odaiba and Tokyo Tower. While daytime and nighttime slots are available, pick one that coincides with sunset – Roppongi is more spectacular when it’s lit up. Best of all, the way we turned heads and cameras, we felt like celebrities. No-one regrets picking the longer three-hour option when they have this much fun. Who needs Photoshop when you have Purikura? Purikura is a Japanese photo booth that’s incredibly popular among the local youngsters. You can easily find one (or ten) in just about every arcade in Japan. A session generally costs about 200 – 400 Yen, and you are able to choose different backgrounds, designs and effects for your Purikura. Instructions are mostly in Japanese but the guessing game is part of the fun! I personally find it hilarious yet interesting to see an almost Anime version of myself with enlarged eyes, smoothened skin, and full makeup on from the Purikura taken in Harajuku, as shown above. For less than 5 USD, it was a lot of fun and laughter! Watch: A day in Harajuku, Tokyo  The Kichijoji Petit Mura (Temari No Oshiro) is a cat café located near the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. Every cat at this café is treated by a nutritionist and has a data sheet where the staff members have to write down how many times they have eaten and how much. I’ve personally seen them furiously scribbling down while making sure that every cat was eating in his own bowl! Guests aren’t allowed to give food to the cats (unless they buy specific snacks at the cat café) and they can’t pick them up or bother them when they are sleeping. At Kichijoji Petit Mura everything is squeaky clean and there’s only one rule: their cats can do everything they want! If you have ever spent a few days in Tokyo you will know that not many people can have pets. So the Kichijoji Petit Mura has quickly become a place to go to cuddle with cats and relax. You’d be surprised to know how many locals bring presents to the cats every week as if they were their own! – Danila of Traveling Dany  If you love budget souvenir shopping, you’ll adore nationwide chain Daiso, a 100 Yen store (all items are 100 Yen plus sales tax). My favorite branch is the three storey one on Harajuku’s Takeshita Dori, and I have whiled away an hour or two inside on more than one trip to Tokyo. Daiso sell anything and everything from food and drinks to simple electronics, from kitchenware and tableware to items for your bathroom and bedroom, from stationery to toiletries and make-up, and a lot more. I always enjoy the odder offerings such as tiny socks for pet cats and dogs, and fun shaped miniature soy sauce bottles to use inside a bento lunch box! – Kavey of Kavey Eats  If you’re coming to Tokyo to see the futuristic side of Japan, then the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, known as Miraikan, is a must-visit. The building itself looks straight out of a sci-fi flick, and the rotating exhibits chronicle various advances in everything from nano-robotics to facial recognition technology. Make this part of a day to Odaiba, Tokyo’s man-made island connected to the mainland via monorail. – Jason of An Epic Education  The Ghibli Museum is a must for people who love animation, especially the classic Japanese movies such as My Neighbour Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, The Grave of the Fireflies, etc. Every little thing is perfect, and it’s highly informative, besides being entertaining. You can see the tricks used to make the animations before the computer era, see how the movies were made, and even enter one scene of a movie! Tickets must be bought prior at a Lawson convenience store. They are timed and you must arrive before your time slot so you can enter! People spend an average of 3 hours in the museum, but if you wish to have a meal there, it can take quite a little longer, so plan ahead. – Thais of World Trip Diaries Watching hundreds, if not thousands of people rush through the infamous Shibuya Crossing / Hachiko Crossing / Shibuya Scramble (they are all the same thing!) is an exciting experience from any angle – from the viewing deck on top of Shibuya 109, Starbucks, or even on the scramble itself. If you want to have the full experience, try coming during peak hours or on the weekends and be ready to get sandwiched between people as you make your way from one end to the other. I personally preferred how it looks at night, with the lights from the buildings and cars making the iconic spot so cool and futuristic. The Shibuya Crossing is just a short walk from Shibuya train station.  There’s no better place to marvel at the astonishing size and scale of Tokyo than from the top of the Tokyo Skytree. The tallest tower in the world, the viewing platform at the summit almost feels closer to the moon than the surface of the earth. To be able to see the entirety of the metropolis of Tokyo from a single vantage point is truly breath-taking. Make sure you pick a clear and sunny day for the perfect view of the snow topped dome of Mount Fuji in the far distance. – James of Where You’re Between  A visit to Tokyo wouldn’t be complete without a trip to the top of a tall building to take in the skyline at night. Greater Tokyo is one of the most populous metropolitan areas in the world and seeing the glittering lights go on forever in every direction is quite a sight. There are many places to take in the Tokyo night view. Our favorite is the Observation Deck at the Metropolitan Government Building. Why? Not only is it 202m high, it has 360 degree views across the city and a bar at the top. But the best thing? Entry is free. In a city known for being pricey, it is outstanding value. – Rachel of Adventure and Sunshine While the list of what to do in Tokyo is practically endless, this guide has the best sampling of this delicious, energetic city. One thing’s for sure: Once you visit Tokyo, you’ll want to keep coming back again and again – I sure do! Great post!  We’re off to Japan next year and I am SOOO excited.  I’m especially looking forward to trying out some of the animal cafes and the Robot Restaurant you mentioned.  I’m bookmarking this post to refer to while we plan.  Thanks for sharing! Enjoy! This is a great guide! I lived there for 3 years and you’ve definitely covered the things that make Tokyo such an amazing and unique place. 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-harajuku/,"10 Quirky Things to do in Harajuku, Tokyo",Japan,"The first time I heard about Harajuku girls was from Gwen Stefani in the early 2000s. While as an adult I see the Harajuku-girls-as-props situation as alarmingly problematic, one thing she said is undeniable: Harajuku girls do have some wicked style. When I visited Tokyo for the first time 11 years ago, seeing this style in person was high on my must-do list. What I learned back then is that Harajuku girls were misfits and outcasts in an otherwise fairly conservative and straight-laced Japan, though popular culture has made their style trendy. I was also surprised to find that Harajuku style wasn’t just a cute Lolita look, but expands to goth, punk, and schoolgirl styles as well. And I can dig it! When I went back to Tokyo this time I knew I had to head back to Harajuku and experience more of it. After all, a lot can change in 11 years! Here are all of the colorful, quirky, and delicious things that I found to do in Harajuku:  If you like bright colors, Alice in Wonderland-esque design themes, And macarons bigger than your head, Then you absolutely must pop into the Kawaii (translation: cute) Monster Cafe. The food, and I use that term lightly, is all colorful and anthropomorphized. Think burgers that look like little monsters and cakes to match. So how does it taste? Well let’s just say it’s a lot more about the looks. It’s also a pretty penny. Each person who goes into the café must pay a ¥500 fee and everyone is expected to order at least one dish and one drink. The drink was kind of like a gelatinous Slurpee and the cake was surprisingly dry considering it was swimming in frosting – we’ll leave it at that.  Would I still recommend it for the experience? Hell yeah! They have special events from time to time too. You can read more on their website.  The colorful crepe shops with glorious Sampuru (fake food – it’s totally a thing in Japan and I am here for it!) dotted along the streets of Takeshita Dori are hard to miss. Crepes may have been invented by the French, but the Japanese have turned them into something all their own. With options including brownies, pudding, ice cream and fresh fruits wrapped generously with whipped cream, as well as savory options, it could be tough to pick just one! Expect crowds and long lines at pretty much all of the crepe shops along Takeshita Dori. What I’d recommend is to quickly get to the shop front, take a quick photo of the Sampuru, step aside and decide which crepe you want, then get in the line to make your order. If you are able to get there early, the Sampuru displays make beautiful background for photos, too. My personal favorite shop (for the lewk) was the Santa Monica Crepes close to where Kawaii Monster Cafe is located. By now, I hope we have established that food in Harajuku is less about filling you up, and all about being absolutely kawaii! The giant rainbow cotton candy sold by Totti Candy Shop is so ridiculously big, it’s an experience in and of itself. It’s actually quite therapeutic to watch one being made, as the cotton candy master sprinkles layer after layer of colorful powder (yum…) as the cotton candy gets larger and larger. If you are in a group, it’s fun to share one and tear the cotton off. Just be ready for the sugar rush! The shop is tucked away on the 2nd floor along the busy Takeshita Dori street, but you will see a pop up stall right below with the same cotton candy stuffed inside plastic cups, as well as groups of people holding what seems like rainbow clouds from afar. Just like the crepe shops, it’s hard to miss the Totti Candy Shop thanks to its popularity. …And the sweet tooth adventures continue! Eddy’s Ice Cream shop is off the main street but easy (and worth the effort) to find. Everything from the interior to the customizable orders makes it clear that the ice cream shop was designed with being photogenic in mind. It’s tons of fun picking the toppings that you can’t find elsewhere, or you can also order directly from the menu. They also periodically offer a “secret menu” depending on the season. At this time of writing in October, they are offering “Halloween Panda” toppings!  Harajuku opened up the world of Purikura to me and I am both slightly creeped out and delighted by it. You’ll walk down a set of stairs into an area full of brightly colored, musical booths. Next, pick the one(s) that appeal to you the most based on what they do for you — each one has its own unique value-add to your, um, face — throw in ¥400 and start posing.  The booth will automatically make your eyes bigger, soften your skin, make your hair silkier and redden in those cheeks and lips. Next you get to pick out the decorations for your stickers. I don’t know if this is what the youth of the world needs to aspire to but I do know that I had fun with it. You can’t go to Harajuku without at least window shopping! Personally I knew that these were my style kindred spirits so I left some space in my suitcase and made a few purchases at W♥C. One was a rainbow sweater and the other was a black and white sweater with the word ‘love’ (爱) stamped all over it. There are also goth shops, accessory shops that are a lot more cutesy and geared towards younger buyers, and full on costume shops. With unlimited space I would’ve gone bonkers but given I only had so much room in my suitcase I exercised restraint. Though it hurt it was for the best, I know. Fret not if you can’t make it to the capital of thrift stores in Tokyo, Shimokitazawa! Harajuku also houses several thrift stores with cool and unique finds. There’s something for everyone – you can find classic thrift shop items like branded sweaters and jackets, cutesy vintage dresses, and straight-up Harajuku style clothes in places like Kinji, Chicago Jingumae, Brand Shift Kaindooru, and Kilo Shop. One word about thrift shopping in Tokyo: it’s not cheap, and the price is often comparable to buying brand new. That said, I thought the selection was great and the items are generally in great condition. I am just stating this so you can manage your expectations if you’re a thrift lover like me! There are not many places in the world that embrace and celebrate unique personal style the way Harajuku do, so why not let your creativity run wild, pull a When in Rome, and dress like a Harajuku girl? I think it’s a fun challenge to get a full outfit from Harajuku and flaunt your purchase proudly! There are often street style photographers around Harajuku scouting for models for fashion magazines and blogs, so you really never know what kind of adventure could materialize.  The Tokyu Plaza, located in Omotesando, is popular for the futuristic design of the entrance. Inside lies a multistory department store, as well as a beautiful rooftop terrace area on the 6th floor, which opens at 8:30AM. It’s perfect for some quiet time before an intense, sugar-filled day at Harajuku! Of course, it is also good for anytime of the day. Grab a matcha latte from Starbucks, sit back, and enjoy people watching from high above.  After all that sugar rushing, there’s perhaps nothing better than a relaxing picnic at Yoyogi Park. Head to a convenience store to grab some snacks and drinks, and enjoy a nice afternoon of people watching at the park. The park entrance is located just 200 meters from Harajuku station so it’s a convenient way to end your fun in Harajuku. While those are just a few of the amazing things to do here as you go, I’m sure you can see the running theme is things that are sweet (so, so sweet!) and fashionable. Above all, just allow yourself to get into it and be fascinated by the unique Harajuku culture. There’s nothing in the world like it! Hey Kristin and Ashley: This was fun and made me laugh; and glad you laughed and smiled a lot too. You both were kawaii and fashionable. Everyone watch the video! It is very entertaining and fun too. A great way to be a tourist for a day (thanks for the sugar, foodie and $ warning too :)!). Thanks for lightening up my day.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/niijima-japan/,"Dreamy Niijima, an Island Paradise Near Tokyo",Japan,"Watching the turquoise waves roll over the gray shoreline, a perfect combination of fine white and black volcanic sand, I kept thinking to myself that if it were in Southeast Asia, this island would be crawling with tourists. This was the last week in October, still perfect beach weather, on the island of Niijima near Tokyo. The water color looks like the tropics, with light blue merging into a deep sapphire. The temperature is pleasing for us Goldilocks types: not too warm and not too cold. Even though this is the surfer’s island there are plenty of ways without crowds on them. It’s the Holy Grail for those who hunt waves.  Even more astounding, it’s just a stone’s throw from Tokyo. I went there as part of an Instameet (which is what it sounds like – photo geeks who meet up to take photos together), with the intention of exploring parts of the island that were beautiful and interesting. This was easy on Niijima, a perfectly chill island where I really could get a beach almost entirely to myself. These were a few highlights:  This onsen was my favorite part of Niijima. I read before that those with tattoos are often denied entry to onsens because of the association with gang culture in Japan – though I understand that is slowly changing. The outdoor onsen on Niijima Is completely free, is open for 24 hours a day, and even if you have tattoos like me that you couldn’t possibly cover up, you’re allowed in! Though it looks like there are other pools under construction, at the time of this writing there are five pools of varying temperatures that seem to increase in order of how one would naturally approach them, with the highest at the top of the stairs near the Greek ruin columns running the warmest. I estimate it to be at about 40-43 degrees C.  The onsen is beautiful, perched on an outcropping of rocks right over the ocean and from the top, it has a perfect view of one of the island’s gorgeous features.  It was so nice, I went twice!  Another free place to visit, this shrine has several smaller structures along the pathway leading up to the main shrine, all of which have their own unique charm. There’s a picturesque little walkway through these up to the shrine, with a mountain dramatically rising up behind the main structure. This is easy to access from the main town either by foot or bike and worth stopping by for 30 minutes or so.  While this might not seem incredibly exciting at first, I loved the waterpark for stargazing. Because there is so little light pollution on Niijima, the stars can be quite dazzling. You’ll find street lights along some of the other main features on the island but the waterpark only has a few little lights so it’s easy to see the stars. There are some archways right when you enter the park that makes for the perfect little photo op. There are lovely beaches all around the island though there are two in particular that I visited that were particularly dreamy, and were also popular with surfers:  This gate is one of the main features of the island and has a parking lot nearby where you’ll see surfers waxing their boards and running into the water. There’s also a large park just behind it, and across from there you’ll find a campsite where many visitors to Niijima end up staying. If you’re there to surf, it would be perfect positioning.  Though I don’t think this beach is that big of a secret, especially since there’s a sign pointing to it, there still aren’t that many people around and the white cliffs are a magnificent sight that’ll make you question if you’re really still in Japan, especially in the early morning hours and sunrise. This is another one that’s popular with surfers so if you’re looking for good waves, apparently this is a great place to go. I learned that Niijima is known for the quality of the rock on the island, formed by volcanoes millions of years ago. You’ll see little Moai statues around, reminiscent of Easter Island, carved out of it. Niijima is the only place in Japan where they do not add dye to the glass, only using what naturally occurs in the sand. That same slate gray sand turns into a soft green color when made into glass that is iconic to Niijima. All of the items are created by glassblowers on the premises, and you can sneak a peek when you walk through the gallery and museum. The pieces are quite high end and priced to match, although there are necklaces and keychains with leaf designs that are only 1000 yen – the perfect souvenir for a vagabond girl like me. There are also several lookout points and hiking trails all around the island, which for such a small island is quite hilly. Some are near the Daisanoshi Shrine and others are accessible via car or a serious bike ride. Famous viewpoints include Omine, Ishiyama, Mt. Miyatsuka, and the Habushiura Observation Deck (which is where the photo at the beginning of the post was taken).  This adorable coffee shop serves up juice, pasta, curry, tea, and coffee, both hot and iced. The owners are friendly and accommodating, even if he didn’t want anything to do with smiling for the photo! This popular café has delicious lunch sets with different items each day. When I was there they had a poke bowl, a lunch set with a little bit of salad, quiche, meatballs, and rice, and seafood fried rice. Since some of the accommodation options have little kitchenettes, I recommend stopping by the grocery store to stock up on breakfast items and other essentials to cook for yourself. Since it’s such a small island with only a few food and drink options, depending how long you stay, you might want to switch it up and cook for yourself. Here’s a map with all of the places mentioned above to help you plan your trip:  To get to Niijima from Tokyo, you can either fly or take the ferry. There are two ferry options, one of which is the fast boat which takes about 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or the long boat which is 8 hours. A flight only takes 35 minutes and you can book that here. The souvenir shops in town rent bicycles which is a perfect way to get around. Though some of the island is pretty hilly, for the most part it’s pretty easy to cycle and with so little traffic, it’s relaxing as well. For accommodation, the local tourism website has some great recommendations. You can also camp, which is popular on Niijima. I recommend giving the island a good 2 to 3 days, or more if you want to surf, to explore it all at a leisurely pace. You’ll soon come to love the laid-back beach vibes, something quite unique to find in Japan. When I visited I felt like it was the perfect combination of city when I explored Tokyo on the surrounding days, and laid-back beach. I hope you come to enjoy this little slice of heaven as much as I do, and to appreciate how lucky we are to have it almost all to ourselves. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Tokyo Metropolitan Government. All thoughts on Niijima are my own and the itinerary was designed by me.  This post is great! The vivid description in the opening paragraph immediately brings me to the beaches of Niijima, and the photography compliments your writing perfectly (especially how you comment on the coffee shop owner not posing for your photo LOL)! I especially appreciated the cultural insight you gave alongside your encounters. I would’ve had no clue about possibly being denied entry to certain places for having tattoos and the association between tattoos and gangs in Japan! The added feature of the interactive map was helpful in organizing any upcoming trips I might be planning. As well, the general travel tips for navigating the islands food and drink accommodations were insightful and transferable to many other destinations — useful! After reading this, I feel like I would know how to have the perfect getaway to this island! That’s awesome I hope you have fun there!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/kyrgyzstan-mountains-hiking/,Kyrgyzstan is the Patagonia of Central Asia,Kyrgyzstan,"I couldn’t help but feel like I had been there before. Did it remind me of the Alps? Covered in snow, greenery, and a blanket of wild flowers in every color I could imagine? Did it remind me of Patagonia? Cold, rugged, coated in glaciers, and perfectly blue alpine lakes? Yet it was something distinctly different. It was something all its own. Kyrgyzstan, once a key transit city between China and Europe on the Great Silk Road, thanks to its favorable geographical location, is a mountainous country that is dominated by the Tian Shan mountain range –  in fact, 94% of the country is 1000 meters or more above sea level. Kyrgyzstan has been an independent country for the past 26 years. It was absorbed into the Russian Empire in 1876, during which many Kyrgyz nomads were forced out into China. Soviet Power was established and Kyrgyzstan became part of the Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR) in 1918, until its independence in 1991. I expected it to be mostly homogenous, but I was surprised by how diverse Kyrgyzstan appeared to be. Kyrgyzstan’s culture started with 40 nomadic tribes who roamed the plains and mountains of Central Asia and western China. The tribes fought the Chinese and Mongol armies and defended their land. The 40-ray sun on Kyrgyzstan flag represents these tribes and today, many Kyrgyz can still tell you the descendant of their tribe family. The nomadic heritage sees its people living in yurts, hunting with eagles and playing kok boru, where men on horseback compete to throw a goat carcass on either end of the field. These may sound like elements of a Game of Thrones episode except that they are the true representatives of the Kyrgyz nomadic culture that one can experience when visiting Kyrgyzstan today, particularly at the biennial nomad games (it’s on in 2018!).  While it is off the popular travel destination radar, Kyrgyzstan’s painting-like sceneries, huge variety of landscapes, nomadic heritage, and the lack of tourism impact offer any visitor a dreamy journey of a lifetime. My guides and I drank the water right from the rivers. We spent an entire day hiking for miles and miles without seeing anyone else. We crossed fast-flowing snowmelt streams and climbed some of the steepest (but not the very steepest) trails I’ve experienced. We hiked over six passes and through eight different valleys, the landscape morphing with each passing kilometer. Each time I was greeted by a new fantastic rock formation, another little collection of yurts along the river, and maybe even a gorgeous lake (or two). This is a mountain-lover’s paradise. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of possible trekking routes one could put together to create an adventure through these mountains. There’s also a lot on offer in Kyrgyzstan apart from the trek I did. One could ski and snowboard in Karakol, swim in Lake Issyk-Kul, explore Ala-Archa Canyon, and have cultural experiences in yurts. The food is delicious too, focused on meat and heavy with the dill, which I love. Bonus? A visa is not required for many nationalities, including Americans. Though this mountainous paradise may not stay off the beaten path much longer – it is ranked at #1 on the list of the top 10 countries ripe for a tourism boom – with 90% of its territory covered in mountains, you are very unlikely to run into too many other travelers. In many cases you’ll just share the peaks and lakes with just local shepherds and their animals. During days 1-3 of my 8-day trek, I hardly saw another soul. *This trip was made possible by Visit Kyrgyzstan and the support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The contents are my sole responsibility and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government. Kyrgyzstan looks incredible. Just everything about it makes me speechless! Love this post! I can’t wait to go. Kyrgyzstan is on my list! It looks absolutely stunning. Another overlooked destination! So beautiful! I’m totally down to visit Kyrgyzstan, hiking is one of the best things ever and I love the idea of going to central Asia. In fact I’m down to visit basically every place you visit, you have awesome taste 😀 Haha, that’s true you comment on every post that you want to go! I agree hiking is one of the best things ever. I’ve definitely been hearing a lot about Kyrgyzstan lately. I’d love to see it before it becomes overrun with tourists. Was it an affordable place to travel? It’s pretty affordable. Not Southeast Asia prices but not bad. More here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-much-does-it-cost-travel-the-world/ Wow, what an incredible adventure. Your photo of the stars is amazing; its often so difficult to capture such beauty! The lake really reminds me of the Laguna de Quilotoa in Ecuador – a crystal blue-green lake surrounded by breathtaking mountains. Truly inspirational! Lovely country and informative post! Thank you for sharing. I’m intrigued about the support you received for the trip from USAID- do you have a section in which you discuss this a bit further? Were you involved in any humanitarian projects while there? As an HIV researcher interested in various USAID projects, I’m curious. -R. P.S.- I also LOVE dill! 🙂 Hi Rachel, they are trying to increase tourism as a way to help the country increase their GDP so that’s why I was there 🙂 Kyrgyzstan looks awesone. Thanks for the great information. Hi Kristin!  I’m heading here very soon and I’m so excited!  Was altitude an issue for you at all in this area? I definitely felt it but didn’t experience any kind of altitude sickness. Everyone is totally different with this, though, so the more time you can take to acclimate the better! I would love to go! Do you have any tour guides you would recommend? I’m not even sure where to start. You could reach out to the tourism board and see who they suggest. How many days was the hike in total? After reading this post, now i want to visit this place. I did 8 days but you can shorten it and do it in 4 if you get a ride to the hot springs and start there.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/trekking-kyrgyzstan/,8 Things to Know Before Trekking in Kyrgyzstan,Kyrgyzstan,"Trekking in the mountains of Kyrgyzstan is an under-the-radar delight. The mountains are dramatic and vast, and while out there you’re spending some days without another soul in sight and others with just a few around. It’s unbelievable how unspoilt it still is, given the incredible scenery. It’s hard to find places like this left in the world. Given that, it’s also quite wild and trekking in Kyrgyzstan comes with its own considerations. The following is what I learned during my 8-day trek out of Karakol: I had soaking wet feet for the first three days of my trek. ‘Wear waterproof boots,’ they said. ‘Oh I will!’ I replied. My fatal error is my boots, after much love in Patagonia and the American Southwest, had two gaping holes on them. I didn’t realize until it was too late and Oh, I suffered for it. Most boots don’t stay water tight for more than a year or two of heavy use and mine were no exception. Check yours first or buy new! These are the ones I use (and will be buying again). You’ll almost certainly be crossing frigid rivers without bridges, and when the water is higher than your boots can go, it doesn’t matter how waterproof they are, you’ll get them wet. It’s better to remove them to cross, and either do so barefoot or even better, with sandals that have tread. Tevas or something similar are great for crossing rivers and for getting out of your boots at night. Double whammy value. My trek that spanned 8 days from the end of June into July required a tank top, sunscreen, a ski jacket, and gloves. Sometimes it’s boiling hot and sometimes it’s freezing cold. One night we even got snow! Even if it feels hot in Karakol, Jyargalan, or wherever you start, plan on cold weather at altitude. For the more popular routes you’ll find a trodden trail, but most of the treks don’t have a trail, markers or even rock cairns.You’ll be doing a lot of GPS plotting and map checking if you don’t have a guide, which brings me to; I almost never take a guide when I trek. I didn’t in Patagonia or Nepal, but in Kyrgyzstan, at least for the more remote trails (and honestly they are the best ones) please don’t go it alone. On day two of my trek to the Almalu valley, we didn’t see anyone else. Seriously not a soul. Even in the middle of summer, the passes can have snow on them. We crossed six passes on my trek, and half of them had snow, which could make for really cold feet. Make sure your shoes can handle it. Clothing-wise. Bring two changes of clothes, 8 pairs of undies, a waterproof jacket, and four pairs of socks. That’s it. Trust me on this one: *This trip was made possible by Visit Kyrgyzstan and the support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The contents are the sole responsibility of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government. This is great advice and the change of climes from warm to snow is really neat. Hygiene in these cases has to be restricting to making sure you don’t get infected or sick, beyond that it is a luxury. Great advice about isolated exploration. You are great about preparing everyone for the challenges (and joy!) of traveling in isolation and how to stay safe and using common sense (I know that some of this is from learning from you own mistakes, but..).  This is true about you especially about the choice of countries where you get to go to exotic places, meet people from many cultures and walks of life, while still picking places that are relatively stable and safe (e.g, Rwanda vs. Burundi). Are you planning to give India a try in the near future (the guest blog about India was very interesting).Is there additional advice you might have about the altitude? You are very healthy, would there be issues for others you might want to give whether this is for them or not or the pacing? I am an avid runner and full of hot air and have been to 15,000 ft (4572 meters) but not even sure to properly prepare. Know there are sites to look at but your personal experience might be useful. Also, a sillier question, can you get by as a vegetarian by going to the outdoor vendors or through the guide? I understand some areas of the word wouldn’t work with this too well and for treks like this you need to be properly fed. Thanks for your thoughts. The advice here works for any trek covering varying altitude and I will keep it handy if I get to hike out West! I think the best thing you can do to be prepped for altitude is hike in altitude. However any endurance training you can do will help! Stair climber, running certainly, stationary bike, swimming. They asked me if I had any dietary restrictions so I’m sure they can accommodate vegetarians 🙂 Good list! So true what you say about the river… I had to cross over 15 rivers, no kidding, and had the remove my shoes in at least 3 of them. I was thinking what did you miss but the only thing I could think of is that the trek is shown on Maps.me, so if you can’t afford a guide, it makes things much easier. And very important, never drink from the main river, as animals hang out on it and it’s not very healthy! I filled the bottle myself and it was full of sediments! Hmm, I did drink from the main river. The small runoffs can actually be worse. Hi Kristin, Your posts inspire me to go soon! Can you suggest a budget and how to save doing the trek? Also about the best time to go there? I check the Ecotrek and it sounds like there will be more expensive for a solo traveler. Thanks! Nadia Hi Nadia, maybe you can ask to join a group that has already booked because yes, it’s more for a solo traveler. You could do it independently as well but I’d stay on the more well marked trails and plan on carrying your own stuff in that case. Hi Kristin, I’ll be traveling to Kyrgyzstan in a week with a couple of friends. Similar to you, we’ll be traveling with a DJI Mavic drone. I was wondering how you managed to keep the drone charged on your multi-day hike. Did you use a solar panel? If so, could you please send me the details of which product you used? Thanks and best,Amine I had three batteries. Unfortunately my solar charger wouldn’t be enough to charge it up, although you could try via USB. I used this solar charger for my camera: https://amzn.to/2lEe7ME Dear Kirsten,  thank you so much for inspiration!! 🙂  We have just a short question: Do you think it is necessary to book a hiking trip for hiking about 2-6 days in advance or do you think, that there are possibilities to book in Kyrgysztan? (we also decided to take a gudie…) I think you can probably book in person, and it would probably be less expensive. There are some areas you need a permit for, but if you’re doing the hike I did, that’s not the case. Have fun! 6 of us from Singapore would like to trek Tienshan in July 2019. Do you have a good guide to recommend? Thanks Ecotrek is good! Hi Kristin  This article is extremely helpful.  My partner and I are planning to go end of May/Early June for two weeks and find a guide while we’re there rather than booking one in advance as we’d like to meet them in person first. What’s the best way to find a good guide? Do you think it would be ok for intermediate travellers to just have a guide for difficult treks and then explore by themselves and travel in a car the rest of the time?  Thanks Yes I think you could travel mostly on your own but get a guide for the off trail hikes and finding one in person should work. My only concern is there will still be snow at the end of May.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tian-shan-mountains-trekking/,Where to Go Trekking in Kyrgyzstan’s Tian Shan Mountains,Kyrgyzstan,"When I googled Kyrgysztan I couldn’t believe the photos I saw. That looks like Patagonia, I thought to myself. I had to go and check it out for myself. After some discussion with a guide and fellow trekking enthusiast, I chose a trail that starts off remote, then leads to one of the region’s most famous (and beautiful) lakes, and back out through a national park. It’s the 8-day trek that was titled Tyrgen-Ak-Suu-Arashan-Alakyl-Karakol-Telety-Jeti-Oguz on the itinerary (that’s a mouth full). This particular trek begins and ends in Karakol, which is about 5 hours away from the capitol of Bishkek by car. We hiked 130 km (81 miles) through the Tian Shan Mountain range, over six passes totaling an elevation gain of about 7,500 meters (about 25,000 feet) up and down, with a few relentlessly steep slopes. Some days are a physical challenge and others are shorter and flatter, but all are stunning. It’s a varied trek, passing through green valley after green valley, with rivers, lakes, sometimes snow, and an ever-present blanket of wild flowers. I would absolutely recommend it. Here’s the itinerary: It was a small group of my guide, Bahram, a porter, Roma, and I on this trek. Things got off to an interesting start when our first bridge was totally covered in water. The river was too powerful to ford so we did what any Oregon Trail enthusiast would do: hire a local to help us across. You can watch that plus some awesome drone footage here:  First he took the bags and then us, one by one. The water lapping at my knees, I kissed my dry feet goodbye and embraced the adventure ahead. The first day was pretty easy, hiking from one valley over a mountain to the next where we camped for the night. I didn’t get much sleep that night. I blame this dazzling night sky.  Day two was, admittedly, a tough one. It began with a 1300 meter climb over the first summit, which was unfortunately so clouded in that there was no reward, no view, for the work. I could tell through the sporadic breaks in the fog that it would be amazing if we could see, though. Next it was a steep descent into the valley where we had to cross the river in one point up to my shins. I had to think happy thoughts to stay positive and warm, but then just before the next summit this showed up you guys: And then this: Perfection in every direction! Additionally, we didn’t see another person all day. Not even a local on horseback. Nada. I love it when that happens. After a rainy night I woke up to see that the mountaintops had been dusted with snow. On June 29. Still, what a beautiful sight! This was a tough ascent. First we made our way down about 500 meters to an idyllic valley with horses grazing and little waterfalls from the snowmelt in the distance. I saw Bahram cross a bridge and start up a mountain slope. Please let’s not be climbing THIS mountain, I thought to myself. But we were. Oh god, we were. It was steep the entire way. My foot bent at a 45 degree angle to match the slope, we climbed for hours. I false peaked over and over until we finally reached the top, about 1700 meters later. ‘This is medium difficulty, Kristin’ Bahram chided with 50 kilos strapped to his back. “What’s high difficulty then?” I wondered. “Climbing, sleeping on, and doing 11 days on a glacier” he replied. Fair enough. Once we did finally reach the top, climbing the last bit through snow, again I was in awe of the panorama surrounding me. It’s that sense of accommodation and the endorphin rush we hikers love, isn’t it? Well that, and the chiseled calf muscles. The day finished at a hot spring, in a more developed little camp with a few other tourists around. It would be the first time we’d camp near anyone else. It would also be a warm and toasty night thanks to the hot springs, my one and only bath all week. Day four brought a bit of welcome relief with a more gradual climb up from the camp. For the first day we did just 4 hours of hiking, with no passes, and no downhills. It was also the first time I saw a real trail, and other hikers on it. It made me miss the tranquility and backcountry feel of the first few days, though on the other hand, I had plenty of conversations on the way which I always love. We camped at the base of the pass leading to Alakol Lake, the fixture that makes this trek popular. We were the only ones to camp at the base of the summit rather than going down to the lake, but we’d had such an intense few days we took it a little easier. The glacier views from camp didn’t hurt, either.  This was the day I’d see a view that almost brought me to my knees crying in awe. We had to earn it, though. The hour-long climb to the pass was steeper than anything I’ve hiked before, requiring scrambling hand and foot in the rock and snow, sometimes sliding backwards.  It made what we reached the top even sweeter. It was a triple threat of glaciers, layers of mountains the color of dark chocolate, and a glowing blue lake. The climb down was a rocky and steep one, with a waterfall partway down. Your day can end in the forest camp, and while at first I wondered why we ended the day so early, once I sat at the (month-old at the time of this writing) bar and chatted with the guys working there I realized it would be a social evening. I highly suggest camping there or at least ordering a beer and hanging out before moving on. The vibe is on point. This was mostly an easy day, beginning with a walk through the forest blanketed with wildflowers in every color imaginable. Then it flattened out for a few kilometers before turning steep again for about an hour and a half after leaving Karakol national park. This was the first hot day of the trek, so it was nice to take it easy, especially after the particularly steep up and down the day before. I have to laugh as I write this to you, laying in the tent while a cow breathes heavily and sniffs around my tent. They keep licking the outside of the tent and tripping over the stakes. This could be your life too while trekking in Kyrgyzstan. I’ll never see cows the same way again. Day seven was a snowy one, beginning with a barefoot walk through a frigid river. I bid the cows goodbye and made my way for the top. Partway up, Bahram started putting covers on the bottom of his pants for snow. Foreshadowing. There had been snow on the trail previously, but not as much as there was on this, the final pass. It was cold, but I also found it to be fun. I love snow. The descent down viscerally reminded me of Switzerland. It was somewhat steep but doable, and gorgeous. That night would be the last, in a lovely valley with a view of a glacier and beautiful flowers. The final day of the trek was almost completely flat, which was so very nice after the previous steep days. It felt long but it was through a lovely valley.  Towards the end you’ll notice a lot more roads and the occasional car. The very end is actually a pretty touristy spot, but it’s also where you can arrange to get picked up. Overall, this was one of the tougher treks I’ve done but also one of the most rewarding. The landscape was phenomenal but the ups were often incredibly steep as were the downs. Half of the days were strenuous and the other were closer to medium or even easy. Keep in mind that the overall gain and loss in altitude is over 7k meters, as there are six passes in total. For perspective, Everest is 8.9k meters. I’d still recommend this to anyone who wants to get a real flavor for the beauty in this area, has the time and the interest, and who loves being in nature. Even the ‘busy’ parts of this trail weren’t very busy, and some had nobody on them at all. I’m glad to have found this place. It opened up a new mountain range of possibilities to me. (For my trekking guides, contact Jyrgalan Destination). *This trip was made possible by Visit Kyrgyzstan and the support of the American people through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The contents are my sole responsibility and do not necessarily reflect the views of USAID or the United States Government. Yes, I was so excited for your Kyrgyzstan coverage to start!!! This looks amazing! I’ve been wanting to plan a trip there forever! I’m in Germany right now and really wanted to fit it in during my year here, but I don’t think I’ll be able to :'( But next time! At least you’re closer now 🙂 What a spectacular area!  I see this whole part of Asia becoming the “hot” destination of the late 2010s, in the same way that the Baltics were in the late 2000s.  Thanks for sharing. It’s been hot for a while! At least for me, but I just love it over there and all of the varied cultures. Well this country just jumped to the top of my list 🙂 That scenery is incredible!! WOW! This was an amazing trek as well! Did you see many other tourists/trekkers? I was a little bit concerned about this so that’s why I decided to skip it and do the Archa Tör Pass (4,000 meters) trek. It was a 4-day day trek and, like yours, it was also amazing and, the best part of it is that we didn’t see absolutely any other trekker. I think we were there at the same time, cause I did it during the last week of June. I am actually writing about it now and I believe will post the complete itinerary in a few days. Salut Kristin! I did see other trekkers, but usually just a few and in most cases I like it when it’s one or two and you see them again and again. It makes it more social. However the first three days were totally raw and wild and there was nobody around at all but the occasional guy on horseback. That was very cool. It was a nix mix. Super inspirational Kristin! I’m trying to get my people on board, this trek is right up my alley. Thanks for the gorgeous photos and post. Awesome! You might be able to find a group to join there, too 🙂 What airport is best to fly to to get here!??! The capital: Bishkek This scenery looks INCREDIBLE. I want to go to Kyrgyzstan like now. I watched your video and was laughing out loud when the cows were licking your tent, by the way haha It was pretty funny in hindsight. OMGAMAZING Kirguistán. Do you think is doable to do this trekking in the second or third week of june? Thanks That’s when I went, but some passes might be snowed in. Hi, looks amazing!!! Are there shorter options for those of us who don’t have mountain-goat heritage 🙂 like a 4 or 5 day option? Which section would you recommend? And what were the sleeping arrangements like on the trail – purely camping or were there also huts/villages to stay in? Sure you can shorten this to just three days if you want to see the lake. There are yurt camps as well, but not on the lake. I slept in a tent each night. Hi, I see that you did it through ecotrek. Which Trek did you chose and how much did it cost? Thanks! It’s named in the intro and it would run €1400 pp unless you’re solo in which case it’s a bit more. I’d ask if you can join another trek of theirs to make it cheaper. You can mention this post and ask them what they can do for you. Wow this is so pretty and such off the beaten path. Thanks for sharing, definitely adding this to my bucket list! Thanks so much- such a great resource and inspiration for my trip next year (that is very much in the planning stages). I watched your youtube videos and you made one comment that the guides could have been a little more professional- what could have been more polished? Also I’m likely to solo it (possibly with 1 friend), I’m 53 and fit with lots of trekking experience under my belt now, do you think the dynamic with your guide/porter would work well (difficult Q I know).Anyway- thanks- I really enjoy your posts.Gill One made a stupid, ignorant drunken comment that he wouldn’t apologize for and I didn’t find it very progressive. I also understand and acknowledge that he’s from another part of the world than I am and was educated differently. The service provided was still good so I didn’t drag him through the mud here for it. I think if you go and find a guide in person who you feel good about, then you’ll be able to suss out the dynamic before you commit, and that could be a good way to avoid any issues, assuming you have the time to do so. Thanks for that Kristin Hi, Kristin! I was looking for high quality photos about our country, Kyrgyz Republic, but unfortunately on web generally all photos are poor in quality. I have seen your photos about Kyrgyzstan and I wanted to ask you it is possible to recieve one of your photo about Kyrgyzstan in high quality? I waold be very grateful, Thank you Depends on what it’s for! I am happy to discuss selling it to you if you’d like. I make part of my living as a photographer so I hope it’s understandable. Thank you very much, your photo will be as a background to my presentation of Kyrgyz Republic. I’ve sent to you my email via facebook. Thank you to understanding Hello Kristin,thanks for all the information you’re providing here! We are planning our trip to Kyrgyzstan and would like to do the same trek as you. Did you need a permit to enter the mountains? I heard that you have to buy a permit to enter zones close to the border (“pagranzona”) but I’m not sure if it applies to the trek you did. Thank you 🙂 Not for this trek but for some closer to jyargalan you do need one, yes. Hi Kristin, we are heading to Kyrgystan in July and I as wondering if you needed to get any permits for your hike (we are doing it solo) and if you were concerned about bears?also, can you recommend any good day hikes around Karakol to acclimatise?Many thanks! Hi Kat, permits aren’t needed for this region, at least when I went (check into the rules though). I didn’t even know bears were a factor! I didn’t do any day hikes to acclimatize personally. Hi Kristin, thank you so much for sharing this! I’m going July/2018 and will be trekking alone. I would love to know about the sleeping arrangements. What temperatures at night, what sleeping bag rating (comfort T.), what mat you’ve used… it’s to help with my packing. I don’t want to feel cold at night in my tent, but I also don’t want to overpack, since I’ll be caring all of my gear. Thank you for any practical info you can give! Happy travels! Regards,Diana Hi Diana, you’ll want to be prepared for the possibility of snow and cold rain, even in July. I didn’t use my own stuff since I had a guide and porters and we used theirs, but I’d say at least rated 0C comfort. Thank you for the info, Kristin!  Do you have a gpx file for this trek? Happy hiking! I don’t. You can definitely buy a map though. Awesome, epic, hike ! Really loved your YouTube video reports (1 & 2). I first found them a month ago and have just rewatched because I arrive in Karakol on the 2nd July for a one month stay and just can’t wait to begin ! I have my two Sonys (noticed you are using Sony too), the drone, the gimbal and have taken many tips from the way you have constructed your excellent videos. I’ve hiked many places in the Himalayas but watching your videos has really got me excited for this trip!  Thanks for the inspiration. Cheers !Kevin Have fun! It’s such a photogenic place. This is a beautiful post and one I have been searching for quite some time now. The hike looks absolutely stunning and straight out of postcards. Kyrgyzstan is pretty high up there in my bucket list already and your blog just made me check the air prices for next year :D. Could you tell where and how to contact the porters and guides. Did you arrange beforehand or on arrival?  PS – The landscape looks a lot like the Kashmir Great Lakes and Tarsar Marsar trek, probably the two prettiest treks in India. Maybe you should check them out too. Thanks for the inspiration.  Cheers,Kingshuk You can definitely arrange once you arrive. Otherwise, I’d contact the tourism board and ask them to help you book. Wow! Great shots – I was just reminiscing about Kyrgyzstan and googled ‘tian shan Kyrgyzstan” and your site came up. We just got back two weeks ago from an 11 day trek to some pretty remote areas. The Inylcheck Valley is one of the most stunningly beautiful valleys I’ve ever seen. It reminded me of Patagonia and Switzerland. Definitely need a guide! We arranged everything months beforehand – our trek required a lot of logistics – horse porters, people porters, private transport, etc. After the trek we got to go to the opening of the 3rd World Nomad Games, which was incredible, plus one day of events. Thanks for posting, I’ll have to check out your site to get some ideas on other treks or travel – I’m going to read your post on South Africa next, then the one on Raja Ampat – my wife and I are going diving there in November!If it’s not on your list already, check out the GR20 Trek in Corsica. Highly recommended – only met two other hikers from the USA on the whole trek. Fantastic and challenging, plus you can get a cold beer\glass of wine and a hot meal at the end of each day, usually served up by a grumpy Corsican running the ‘huts’. Cheers! I heard that’s a challenging one. I’m quite intrigued, though! Hi Kristin, Is it possible to bike this trek with a mountain bike or can it only be done on foot? Awesome and inspiring pics! Val Definitely not bikeable. i think by foot only. Hi Kristin, I’m going to do my first trek ever this summer with a guide from Destination Jyrgalan. I’m going solo but am a bit nervous about going alone with a male guide and porter. Did you have any concerns before your trek?  Thanks in advance for any advice. If you’re doing this trek it’s a pretty busy and popular trail, if that assuages the worries at all. I didn’t feel nervous but you have to do what you’re comfortable with! You can ask for the specific name of the company and see what reviews there are online if that would help at all as well. Hey Leanne. How was your trek with Destination Jyrgalan? Which trek did you do? I’m finding that they aren’t very responsive.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cost-of-travel-cambodia/,Tips from the Banker: What it Really Costs to Travel in Cambodia,Cambodia,"I spent an entire month in Cambodia, starting in Siem Reap, heading through Phnom Penh and to the coast, and then up north through Kratie and Banlung, hitting most of the spots backpackers tend to frequent, and even a few of the lesser-known ones. It would appear that pricing in Cambodia has steadily gone up over the last few years.  This is inevitable as tourism continues to rise, but it is still, absolutely, a budget destination. Luxury resorts, VIP buses, and fancy restaurants have mushroomed all over the main Cambodian cities, yet at the same time, budget hostels, tuk-tuks, and local eateries remain available to backpackers on a shoestring budget. What’s more, the de-facto currency in Cambodia is US Dollars, making it a little easier for yours truly to navigate the system. I have read in many places on the interwebs that a thrifty backpacker can travel through Southeast Asia for roughly $30 per day, or $1000 per month.  Some insist it can’t be done while others swear by the figure. My verdict? It can be done. It is still one of the cheapest travel destinations in the world. I know, because I did it.  This will be the cheapest part of Cambodia if you work it right.  Stay in dorms whenever possible and accept that you most likely won’t have air conditioning or hot water.  This is pretty irrelevant as you will probably only be in your dorm while you’re sleeping, and it’s so hot in Cambodia, there’s really no need nor desire for a hot shower. Hostels in Siem Reap:  $3-$10 (book your hostel in Siem Reap here) Hostels in Phnom Penh: $4-$8 (book your hostel in Phnom Penh here) Hostels in Kampot: $3-$5 (book your hostel in Kampot here) READ: The best hostels in Cambodia  If you are just getting from one spot to another, use Grab app, which is exactly like Uber, but Uber is no longer available in Southeast Asia. You can register with a credit card or pay cash directly to the driver. A ride from the airport to the city center is about $5, whereas if you approach a regular taxi driver, you are likely to be quoted twice the price. Short distance rides typically cost less than $1. If you are touring Angkor Wat, consider taking a push-bike vs. a tuk-tuk or motorbike, if possible. A tuk-tuk costs $15/day while a bike costs $2. If a push-bike is not an option and you need to hire a driver, walk out to the street to hail a tuk-tuk as opposed to allowing your guesthouse to do it for you. You’ll also be much better off if you make friends with the driver and negotiate fair rates.  Always haggle. The same logic applies for heading directly to the bus station to book tickets vs. through your guesthouse or a tour operator. Most busses ran anywhere from $3 to $8 for anywhere from 2 to 9 hours worth of driving. Western food can be found for anywhere from $2 to $6 for a standard meal. Breakfast is available at any time of the day.  Street food isn’t as prevalent as in, say, Thailand, but it is still easy to find and relatively cheap.  Although, you might not really know what you’re eating, and you’ll need to be a little adventurous. READ: What to eat in Cambodia Cheap: The cheapest place I stayed at was Banlung, just south of Laos.  My guest house cost $2 for the dorm, but I also watched as two rats, followed by a frog, hopped across my guest house floor.  You can also stay in Sihanoukville practically for free, but I chose the less-seedy Otres beach and only paid $3/night for a basic room with a mattress, mosquito net, and a shared bathroom.  It’s all you really need. Expensive: The islands, particularly Ko Ta Keo and Koh Rong, were the most expensive.  Bungalows run anywhere from $15-$25 per night, but often accommodate several people.  This is a little tougher as a solo traveler, but one can find friends to bunk with. Larger cities like Siem Reap and Phnom Penh also tend to cost a bit more than the smaller towns, but one can still easily find $5-$6 dorms. As any long-term traveler will tell you, alcohol eats your budget up quickly.  I could have spent about $100 less had I not imbibed on $1 Angkor beers (but how can you resist?!). Tickets to Angkor Wat are also getting more expensive each year, but it’s the top reason why many people want to travel to Cambodia and it’s not an experience you want to skip to save money. What’s more, I spent about $10 total on unlimited 3G data for my iPhone. Now THAT is a steal.  *I did visit Cambodia during what would be considered the low season.  Naturally, pricing was a bit lower during this time.  I also traded a blog post in exchange for free SCUBA diving and accommodation, plus a trek while in Cambodia.  These all helped me keep my costs in check. So, in my opinion, though Cambodia is more costly now than it was even two years ago, for example, it is still an absolute budget destination that can easily be done with only $1000 to your name. These are all really great practical tips. I just hope the prices don’t go up anymore by the time I get there! Get here now!!!! Asia is so cheap it’s incredible. I think I saved enough for my 3 months trip. I hope I won’t have to beg or clean toilets to be able to get back home 😉 Haha,  YOu’ll be good, girl 🙂 Added to the resources page – thanks lady! reallly?! Awesome!!! Yep! I didn’t want to leave Otres! Private msg me for more details 🙂 id sure like to know im heading out there in the next 8 months When you travel quickly expenses can rack up but this is proof that traveling slowly can be done for much less money. Absolutely.  Buying plane tickets and bus tickets racks up like crazy. very cool. Is there any visa and consular expenses for americans? I traveled to 5 stans of central asia last year – had to get 5 visas :o. Thanks for good tips on Thailand. Yes the fee is USD$20 for a visa. You can get it on arrival. Thank you for some good tips here! Cambodia is one of the most beautiful and affordable country to visit in Asia! thanks alot for the tips… I love reading all your posts, so helpful and exciting! 🙂 My friend and I are going to SE Asia for 3 months at the beginning of March. We thought that was a lot of time but then now are feeling a bit rushed.  We want to spend more time in Thailand, Indonesia and Philippines. Did you find it difficult getting around to each place? Hoping it wont take forever to travel around as it wastes time 🙁 You’d be OK in Thailand, but honestly, I spent 6 weeks in Indonesia, 4 in the Philippines, and now about 16 collectively in Thailand. Indo and the Philippines are BIG and hard to get around. It’ll be a little more expensive because you’ll need to fly and boat a lot. If you just try to hit these 3 in the three months you’ll see lots of beautiful things and definitely will enjoy yourself. It’s when people try to hit 7 countries in three months that I just laugh and think of all that they’re missing by moving so quickly. How did you get the internet for so cheap? SIM cards are cheap! Hello All, You sound like you travel like us…or me in my younger days…. My kids (20, 17, 13) and I planning on a  quick trip, traveling to SE asia, only 2 1/2 – 3 weeks (the job problem)…Flying into Siem Reap ~ June 26th and traveling across by land to Guiyang China for a wedding July 12, 2014.We are pretty low budget (I feel too old for super seedy, and try to treat myself sometimes!) travelers (because we like it . Prefer no rats, but fairly adventurous, don’t need fancy accomodation, intersting is always good, friendly propriators that you feel good about giving your hard earned money to, like local food, people etc.  We have to be fairly superficial etc…obviously, but, our plan is to travel maybe to Phenom Pehn, did you go to the Elephant Valley Project? or one of the other elephant places (not to ride, but to visit) up through Laos (did you like La Prabang, was it worth time?), did you go to the Bolaveen Plateau? We plan to be in Hanoi by ~ July 8 and spend a night on the boat (did you have a driver/boat group that seemed good? What would be  a reasonable cost?) Do you have any “not to miss” stops, cool, unique (reasonable) guest houses (this Mom will want AC at night!) Is this an unrealistic itinerary? If you met any reliable safe, (nonsmoking ??!!) drivers etc that you would want to refer  to us, let us know and we will try to use them. Any suggestions are welcome. Hi Ann,If you check out the pages I have broken down by country under the destinations tab, or the travel map link at the top of the homepage, you can see my exact itinerary along with all of my travel tips on each destination. My Cool Places to Sleep tab also talks about my favorite accommodation options. Hi, Are teaching jobs easy to find in Cambodia? I’m planning to go there to find a teaching job. I have a degree, but no certificate. Thanks. I’ve never looked into it, John. I had a friend who taught there for 6 months, though. I don’t think it was too difficult for her. So much to see in Cambodia! Thanks for your comment. Hi Kristin, This is a fantastic post that gives some great tips on how to save a bit of cash in Cambodia (which is first thought to be a very cheap country).  I agree that travel can start to get expensive especially when you are not keeping track of your spends. The Tuk Tuk swap for a bike is a must! My boyfriend and I also did a trip to Cambodia and documented most of it, feel free to have a read as it has some great stories and advice in there! http://www.whoneedsmaps.com/destinations/cambodia/ Thanks for sharing! I had a journey in Asia last year. And I found the travel cost is so low, especially in China, Taiwan, Thailand etc. Cambodia is really a good place to visit in Asia. Last Year, I’ve been to Cambodia. I think the total cost is not too high or too low. It is reasonable. Basically, if you are an American, the cost for you in Asia is very low. How much are plane tickets to Cambodia, roughly? What is the most strategic way to buy a plane ticket?  Thank you! 🙂 Um, no idea it depends on where you depart from! Do a Google Flights search Hi Kristin,please suggestion to me, How to make plant for your travel.i’m reading your tip so happy 🙂 I don’t really plan. I just save up and go! Hi Kristin,What is the best time of the year to visit the SE Asia?Dave any time, really. It’s a bit warmer and rainier in some parts than others but all year it’s hot and humid for the most part. Hi, I’m doing a solo trip as a female in my 40’s and it sounds relatively safe.  I am flying to Siem Reap from Da Nang Vietnam and am finding it surprisingly expensive!  Anyhow, after Angkor, I plan to bus it to Phnom Penh for a couple days, and then bus again to Ho Chi Minh City to fly home.  Is it a beautiful/scenic bus to Phnom Penh and the next leg back into Vietnam?  I understand there is also a  partial Mekong River route…would you happen to know much about that in regards to how comfortable it is and how long it takes to get to Phnom Penh from Siem Reap or Phnom Penh to HCMC?  It  appeals to me if it doesn’t take over a day.  Curious to know if any of you on this post have done that option?  Any help you can provide would be helpful!  I’m leaving in 16 days!  I fly into Hanoi and am doing Halong Bay, then flying to Da Nang. I’ve only bussed from Siem Reap to PP and if memory serves it was fine and took maybe 7-ish hours, but we had a breakdown, which is normal. I’ve heard horror stories about bussing from Laos to Vietnam, though, so it’s possible it’s equally unpleasant to go from Cambodia. Not sure! Hello Lovely, Great Post!!! My self and my partner are going to travel SE asia next year just wondering do you think that 16-18K for 4 and a half months is enough? Thanks 🙂 That’s more than enough as long as you aren’t big spenders. I did a whole post on the subject here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/southeast-asia-on-a-budget/ Hi! Thanks for the great info!  Just wondering where you get the 3G card from when your there? Thanks, Danielle You can usually get it at a cell store in the bigger cities or at the airport. i have been to cambodia, only a short trip. I found a hostel in siem reap for 3$ usd. i guess it depends where you go. After siem reap i went to battambang and i stayed for 2 nights in a 2$ dorm! i found cambodia the cheapest after many trips in thailand and one month in vietnam. thanks for sharing this site and i enjoy you’re insight. Cheers! I found it to be the cheapest overall too.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cambodia-itinerary/,The Best Things to do in Cambodia: A Perfect Itinerary,Cambodia,"When I first embarked on my solo travels in 2012, I landed in Bangkok and five days later, boarded a train and headed straight to Siem Reap. The temples, thanks to Tomb Raider, had long enchanted me and it just seemed right to see them with my own eyes. Cambodia ended up being my favorite country to backpack through during my first 10 months in Southeast Asia. In fact, this country had me completely smitten. The kids made me feel like a superstar, the food was delicious, and the temples and other incredible places left me in awe. Now that I am back in Southeast Asia, I realized I never really put together a Cambodia itinerary for you, so here it is! This works for different lengths of stay, as you can pick and choose what to hit and what to miss, starting from the capital, which can be easily reversed or switched up depending on your entry point: The country’s capital is a good place to start your journey in Cambodia, especially if you are flying in. A wide range of food and accommodation options are available for travelers of all budget levels. I’d suggest spending 2 to 3 nights to get a feel of the capital, its people and the country’s history and culture. Here are a few things to do in Phnom Penh: Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum & The Killing Fields Be mentally prepared before you visit the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum (known as the S-21 Prison) and The Killing Fields – it’s a time traveling experience to a dark time in Cambodia that may leave you in complete shock and disbelief that such genocide has taken place fewer than 40 years ago, during which more than one million people lost their lives in vain under the Khmer Rouge regime. At the S-21 Prison, photos of some of the victims are lined up on a board, displayed in the rooms that were used to imprison, torture, and kill them. Walking through the rooms, imagining what went down there, is a feeling that words cannot describe. At The Killing Fields, I highly recommend paying the extra to rent the headphones and follow its instructions to tour the area. Royal Palace & The Silver Pagoda For a lighter Phnom Penh experience, check out the beautiful Royal Palace and the Silver Pagoda, which are conveniently located next to each other. If you are not ready to pay to enter, the entrance itself is a beautiful place for photography or simply people watching. Russian Market I wouldn’t recommend shopping here as prices are highly inflated. However, this Phnom Penh icon is definitely worth a visit to get a feel of the Cambodian market scene. If you want to get some shopping and street food hunting, consider heading to the Kandal Market – you can even get a hair wash and a manicure for less than $5! Stay: Mad Monkey Hostel or Saravoan Royal Palace From Phnom Penh, take a bus to Sihanoukville, the gateway to the beautiful island, Koh Rong, and my favorite Cambodian beach, Otres. Sihanoukville has established itself as a party and gambling place that I’m not a huge fan of, but the surroundings are worth staying a few nights, or weeks, in. Stay: Onederz Sihanoukville or Patchouly Chill House Otres Beach Otres is one of my favorite beaches in the world, and in my opinion, one of the chillest places in Asia. Unlike the buzzing Sihanoukville, Otres is laid back and quiet. I remember staying on this beach for more than a week, losing track of time and intention to leave. It’s the place to let go and relax. Read more about it here. That said, it’s been more than 5 years since I was there, and from what I’ve gathered, Otres has indeed developed more, but it is still so very beautiful. Stay: Taste of Paradise Koh Rong I was pleasantly surprised by how dreamy Koh Rong was, though I’ve heard now Koh Rong has turned into a party island. That being said, like any party islands I’ve been to, one can always find a quiet, peaceful spot that no one else seems to go. For Koh Rong, that spot is Sok San Beach. There are basic (we are talking about no fan, no heater, one light bulb that works for a few hours per day kind of basic) bungalows that are right on the beach, facing some of the clearest waters, with bioluminescence painting the sea with neon lights at night. You might sometimes find yourself the only person walking on the beach. That sounds like a paradise to me. Stay: Sok San Beach Bungalows Koh Rong Samloem Koh Rong’s little sister, Koh Rong Samloem, is even more secluded and off-beat. There are only four beaches on this island: Sarancan Bay, which is the most popular out of the four, with better facilitated resort options; M’Pei Beach, located in a fishing village with great diving opportunities; Sunset Beach, with more backpacker-friendly accommodation options; and finally, Lazy Beach, where crossing a jungle is required to gain access. It is many off-beat lovers’ favorite out of the four. Stay: Sweet Dreams Samloem or Saracen Bay Resort Perhaps it’s a Cambodia thing, but Kampot is another place that many travelers end up staying in much longer than intended. While the frequently-seen retired expat men and extremely young local companion-combo made me feel uneasy, Kampot itself is a charming place to forget about everything else and get lost on a bike. Other than the slow-paced lifestyle and architecture with a mix of French and Chinese influence, the town is also popular for pepper, which has truly elevated the culinary palette in Kampot. Though I’m not a shellfish lover, I hear that the Pepper crab is a do-not-miss. Go to a local market, haggle with the local Khmer saleswomen, and pay to get your crab cooked to perfection with that delicious kampot pepper sauce. Stay: Mad Monkey Hostel or Sabay Beach  A sleepy town close to the coast, Kep has a similar atmosphere to Kampot. Just about a 20-minute boat ride away lies Rabbit Island, also known as Koh Tonsay, which is yet another laid back destination that is often overlooked by tourists. I don’t remember seeing any rabbits during my stay, but I certainly remember hopping around happily like one, lost in my own world watching the sunset on a quiet beach with nobody in sight. If you are looking to be completely off the grind, Kep is for you. Most people are here on a day trip from Kampot, but I’d totally recommend staying a few nights. I mean, why not? Stay: Khmer House Hostel From the coast, head back towards Siem Reap, which might require an overnight in Phnom Penh again. I’d suggest NOT going to the Angkor Wat right away, but spend your first day soaking in the beauty that is Siam Reap. It’s so dynamic that one blink could result in missing something really interesting. I remember smiling and waving at a motorbike that drove by with two adults and three children packed on, haggling with 5 Tuk Tuk drivers at the same time, and watching women doing their laundry by the river with babies strapped on their backs. While the city is fast developing with resorts, malls and restaurants, at every corner you can still find the Siam Reap of old. Pub Street Buzzing with neon lights at night, Pub Street is an awesome place to hang out after exploring the temples. Just about everyone traveling in Siem Reap goes there, so it’s also a great place to meet people and potentially plan the next few days’ adventures together. Shopping requires strong haggling skills as prices are definitely inflated here. The party scene is great though, just drink with caution as it’s really easy to knock one too many back when the beer is only 50 cents. If you are riding a motorbike in, make sure you remember where you parked the bike, because the last thing you want is to spend hours looking for your bike in the confusing streets (they all look the same!). Markets Siem Reap is not short on markets and they’re all worth exploring. My personal favorite was the Old Market, where you can see old Cambodian ladies squatting next to their products for sale, which could range from vegetables, live seafood, meat, to clothes, household goods and toys. It gets pretty chaotic with locals and tourists squeezing their way through, so it’s always a good idea to carry a theft-proof bag, just in case! Other awesome markets include the Made In Cambodia Market, which offers a refreshing change from the repetitive Angkor Wat t-shirts and elephant pants. Everything in this market is made in Cambodia by local artisans. If you are looking for something unique and would like to fully support the local enterprises, this is definitely the right market for you. For a good bargain, go to the Angkor Night Market. Whether you will end up with an actual good bargain or not depends on your haggling skills, but $2 massages will always sound like a great bargain to me, and there are plenty of them in the Angkor Night Market! Angkor Wat I don’t say “you can’t come here without visiting/doing/eating this” very often, but you can’t go to Siem Reap without visiting the majestic Angkor Wat! It’s one of the most awe-inspiring things I have ever seen in my life. After all, it is often called the “Eighth Wonder of the World”! Read about my Angkor Wat experience here and here. Entrance fees have gone up several times since I was there in 2012. The latest prices are: 1-day: $37 3-days: $62 7-days: $72 It is a substantial amount when on a backpacker budget, but I’d still highly recommend going for more than one day. You can save on transportation and food by renting your own bike and bringing in your own street food from town. A tuk-tuk driver for a day typically costs about $10 – $15, whereas a bike costs about $2 per day. The restaurants around Angkor Wat are incredibly expensive, sometimes costing twice as much as the restaurants in town! Packing a snack and a big bottle of water and taking a push bike will definitely help save some money on your Angkor Wat adventures, plus it’s more fun! Stay: Mad Monkey Hostel or Bliss Villa I am not done with the laid back towns of Cambodia! Battambang is not as off-beat as the ones mentioned above, but it’s a good getaway from the hustling Siem Reap for a day. Located just 3 hours away from Siem Reap by bus, Battambang offers a unique bamboo train experience to visitors. The local government has previously closed down the station for refurbishment, and now the train has been rebuilt at another place and is up and running, according to a reader who was just there (thanks, Elvira!). There are also other places worth checking out, such as the bat cave and the Killing Cave, a place that was used to kill and dispose of bodies during Khmer Rouge. The piling of human skulls remind me of the Killing Fields in Phnom Penh, though with less historical information available. It’s also possible to hike up to the summit and imagine what went down there. Other than that, there are also smaller temples and local markets in Battambang that may seem less impressive than the ones you saw in Siem Reap, but possibly much more authentic and affordable. I recommend spending a day out here before heading back to Siem Reap. After a few days (or few weeks, I really wouldn’t be surprised at all) spent away from it all and playing Tomb Raider in the temples, it will be a good time to head back to Phnom Penh, enjoy the street food markets and get a good night’s sleep on an actual bed. Take a bus the next day towards the northeast to Kratie and Banlung. Now if you ever dreamed of becoming a celebrity when you were a child, Kratie is a good place to realized that dream, even just for a while. I rode a bicycle around, surrounded by jungle-like flora, cows, and kids who would run out of the wooden shacks to say “hello” gleefully. It was an endless sea of ‘hello!’ all day from the kids, who wanted nothing more than to hear hello back. The ride itself was also enjoyable, with colonial architecture to admire and occasional nice breeze coming from the Mekong river, which is always welcome in the ever so warm Southeast Asia. Kratie is also popular for Mekong Irrawaddy dolphin spotting, but it has definitely done more harm than good to the dolphins as no proper regulations and protections are in place. I am not one to push my opinions on anyone, but as tourists, we vote with our dollars, so it’s always helpful to do some research and think twice before participating in animal tourism. Stay: River Dolphin Hotel Yet another unruffled town that’s wonderful to get lost in. I am starting to sound a little repetitive now, but honestly, it’s hard to find so many laid back places in one country in Southeast Asia. While everywhere else is booming in development, somehow Cambodia, outside of the main cities, is keeping things relatively nice and slow. Banlung is about 4 hours north from Kratie, and there are minivans available on a daily basis. To be honest there’s not much to do in here, but that’s sometimes the whole point! When you are done day-dreaming in a hammock, rent a motorbike and head for the volcanic lake and pretty waterfalls close by. If you’re heading north into Laos, this is the perfect place to finish out your Cambodia itinerary. Stay: Bee Bee’s Chalets Those are a few of Cambodia’s more beautiful and special places, though like most of Southeast Asia, it’s always evolving with new places popping up all the time, just ripe for adventure and discovery. I hope this is helpful for you. Let me know in the comments if you have any other destinations in Cambodia that I should check out next time. READ MORE: Click here for my complete guide to Cambodia and Click here to see how much it costs to travel in Cambodia  Great list and follow up to the posts you made years ago which you all can find in the “destinations” section. I like how you do these updates and hope you have a chance to return there like you have in Thailand-Indonesia one day. Cambodia has a lot to offer and is trying to benefit from the great influx of travel interest and economic improvements that occurring there as well as in SE Asia in general. I wish their people well as they exit a dark period and enter one of hope, peace, and prosperity (and a history to always learn from). Appreciate your sensitivity to what happened there and provided suggested sites to learn of this (plus at one time you all recommended reading a book like “First They Killed My Father”) while also encouraging once again to support the locals while being kind to the environment including the dolphins. That can sometime be a big issue in the United States, too, even with all the regulations with regards to marine life. For what it is worth, Kristin, I believe something like 40 percent of Cambodia is protected land, and like with the rest of SE Asia, efforts are being made with the help of the West to preserve this area and improve air and water quality. Climate change is an issue too because so much of the area is near sea level so it is becoming important. I read how Cambodia contains rare elephant paths and has incredibly high biodiversity.As for recommendations, never been to Cambodia, but based on your Thailand trips, are there some neat places to visit in Cambodia in terms of mountains? You mentioned waterfalls, so maybe that covers it, but I imagine the mountains would certainly be off the beaten path and have their own secrets. I understand that the mountainous areas are more stable than 5 years ago (I keep up with the politics) and you can probably access these areas safely and it would be pristine and tourist-free for now. However, you are so good about this so I trust your opinion on that, but thought maybe there are some mountain destinations worthwhile (Cardamom Mountains? See them on the map..).Thanks! Wow – those entrance fees are pretty serious!  I’m not really a budget traveler, but I would still be reluctant to pay that much unless I could be sure it was being used ethically! It’s actually privately owned by a company in Japan, so, who knows? What do u do when u see a grown man with a child as his girlfriend.  I would want to beat him to a pulp I think everyone probably does. I’ve only seen it once. What CAN I do other than shake my head in disapproval? This seems perfect guide to visit cambodiabookmarking your post for future reference Cambodia is one of my bucket lists and i’ll go there this July! Cannot wait to go there after seeing your posts. Definitely will go to some of these places (Angkor Wat is a must!) Have fun! I am visiting Cambodia in June for a month and have been searching for itinerary ideas. We land in Phnom Penh and would like to travel north east as far as stung Treng, then head across to siem reap from there. I believe there are a couple of minibus companies that do this trip, would it be a problem as the wet season begins? We then plan heading back south along the west coast and back to Phnom Penh, that way not retracing our steps. Does this sound like a good plan with 4 weeks travel time? It will just depend on the road conditions but minibuses usually work. It’s the method the locals take. Just don’t expect to be ON TIME. That’s the only thing that you have to remember when using NON-major bus companies.. I would even say rent your own motorbike in Phnom Penh, but it is also wet season. I would HIGHLY recommend going out to Silk Island on the Mekong RIver just outside of Phnom Penh, ride around on motorbikes, explore the silk farms, local farms, and stay at Le Kroma Villas (or even just use their pool and get lunch)… it was my favorite LOCAL thing to do when I lived in Phnom Penh. I lived in Cambodia for a year (last year) and your itinerary is great! It is definitely the truth to what Cambodia has to offer and what it is all about… I would just add Mondulkiri Province is wonderful too (northeast of Phnom Penh/Siem Reap) and well-known for waterfalls, hiking, and volunteering with elephants (well-known company/project that treats their elephants very well, unlike other places in SEA)… and I would add Kep, for it’s amazing seafood. I would even do a day-trip from Kampot to visit the crab markets, maybe watch the sunset on the beach, or take a boat to the island off of Kep. Not sure if you added the Kampot pepper farms that cost very little to nothing. The trip out to the pepper farm is magical! Cambodia is an extremely special place that is off the beaten path… what Thailand and Vietnam were YEARS AND YEARS AGO! For those of you looking to travel around Cambodia, I would recommend joining Facebook groups related to what you want to do (Taxi Shares Cambodia would be one I would recommend for finding buses and what not to get around).. I would also recommend spending a few more $$ and going with Giant Ibis, they are the BEST of the BEST! Reliable, ON TIME, comfortable, AC, and give a little snack on the trip. Otherwise, you never know what you will get!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/get-sim-cards-southeast-asia/,How to Get SIM Cards in Southeast Asia,Cambodia,"In a comment on a recent post, I was asked to write about traveling with an unlocked iPhone (or any smart phone, really), obtaining SIM cards abroad, and how the whole process takes place. Kellie, I’m glad you asked. I have been traveling for over 5 years now with an unlocked iPhone, always buying a prepaid SIM in the local country I happen to be traveling in. Why buy a local Sim? I have found in Southeast Asia that this is particularly helpful because the Wifi is often weak, but the 3G is usually quite strong.  It’s also great to be able to make calls when needed and to always be able to use the google maps function.  It gives me peace of mind. Why buy an unlocked phone? I had originally obtained my phone with a contract with AT&T back in the United States.  As anyone who has tried to unlock a phone knows, one can only do this by calling the provider after the 2-year contract is up.  We won’t even address traveling with a SIM from back home, because that is prohibitively expensive.  If your contract is not yet up then your options are somewhat limited.  You can, A: Call your provider and ask them to put you on a disabled plan. This was allowed with AT&T for 6 months at $10 month, which finished out my contract.  It’s not ideal, but it’s better than the $75/month I was previously paying.  The phone will still be locked, but you can use it with wifi only, which is still useful.  You can then buy a cheap local phone with a local SIM B: Put your phone on a disabled plan and use a shady 3rd party website to unlock it. Honestly, I went with this plan, though I won’t link the website I used here (but you can contact me if you really want the details) and I probably should not have just admitted that, as it goes against the contract and one can be fined for doing so SIM card availability for smart phones Generally, I find that many countries in Southeast Asia are now catching up and the iPhones are more and more available, meaning micro and nano SIM cards are as well.  That said, there have been plenty of times when the person at the stall handed me a standard SIM along with a pair of scissors as well.  Sometimes they have a SIM cutter and sometimes they don’t. In the cases that they don’t I just remove my current SIM, match up the edges, and cut.  It does’t have to be perfect, it just has to generally fit (and make sure you’re only cutting the plastic part). How to find a SIM card There are a few ways to find a SIM and it depends on the country. In Thailand, they can be easily purchased at 7-11. I personally use DTAC, and I buy it directly at the DTAC store. They tend to have locations in big cities such as Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Bangkok. 4G is widely available, and data plan runs at about 100 baht for 1GB worth of data valid for a week. One must also buy the SIM itself for around 50 baht, if memory serves.  There were no language barrier issues. in Cambodia, Metfone is the most popular network, and you can find the flagship stores in major cities. 1.5GB worth of data valid for a week costs just $1.5. There are no 7-11s in Cambodia, but SIMs can be bought at smaller cell stands as well.  There were no language barrier issues in Siem Reap. In Laos, it was a little less straightforward.  I paid around $10 for a SIM and found that the data ran out fairly quickly. I never found a cell store there and just bought from a nondescript stand. I wish I could be more helpful here, but I was pretty disconnected in Laos and didn’t worry too much about it. In Malaysia, it is not as cheap to stay connected. There are a few good companies and you really can’t go wrong. Most malls there sell the SIMs which include data and some calling and texts.  Since most Malaysians speak English quite well you shouldn’t have much issue getting a SIM. With the country’s largest network, Maxis, 1GB worth of data valid for a week costs about $2.5. Indonesia still baffles me a bit.  In Medan, I bought a SIM with the 3 network for only $3, and the 3G never ran out over the 6 weeks that I lived there.  I still don’t understand why because the man I bought it from spoke no English and at the time I spoke almost zero Bahasa.  However, it only worked in major cities.  Simpati was the best bet for the islands, such as Lombok and Bali, but I had to reload it constantly. I found that small amounts ran out very quickly, but as soon as I put USD$10 on there, it lasted for a while. There’s also usually a service fee to reload, so might as well do it infrequently.  This can all be handled at cell phone stands and convenience stores. With all of the SIM purchasing scenarios, make sure the 3G is fully functioning before walking out of the store or away from the stand. It’s often not as straightforward as just popping in the SIM and you may need some additional help setting up the network. There you have it.  The ins and outs of buying a SIM are actually pretty straightforward, but just take a little bit of know how in some countries prior to purchasing.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the comments section. This was super helpful! I never have a phone when I travel (I just use mine for WiFi) and I really don’t know why. It’s so cheap and so convenient in tons of places. It IS nice to feel disconnected…but Google Maps is also great. Always a trade-off! I do enjoy being off the grid from time to time too! For Malaysia I used Tune Talk, the SIM card which I purchased along with my Air Asia ticket (although you can purchase it upon arrival) and picked up at the airport. The staff where very helpful and set up my phone so I didn’t have to do anything! It cost me about $30 per month if I remember correctly 🙂 For Indonesia I can’t remember exactly what SIM I used (I’m thinking something called eXcel), but I remember I paid for it and then the lady at the shop couldn’t get it to work on my phone (HTC smartphone). I went back to my room and Googled it, and sure enough – there were instructions on how to change the settings to make it work. I think I put about $20 on for the month I was there. It worked on the Gillis and on Lombok.  For any Australian readers – it SHOULD be free to get your phone unlocked. Just contact your service provider, put your plan on hold (they usually do this for free for up to 3 months, though any insurance you pay on top of it, you still need to pay). For Vodafone, you should be able to unlock your phone online. IMPORTANT – make sure you do this before you leave Australia as you need to input some codes into your phone. Thanks for the additional info! I had no idea about Tune Talk or that Aussie phones can be unlocked while under contract. Awesome! Thank you so much, Kristin! This is just what I needed. Like you said, it’s a painful outlay at first so I’ve been holding off. The camera is important to me so I’m probably going to get the new 5S but I’m still figuring out which country to buy from. I feel like I’m slowly getting closer though and I’ll be coming back to this very useful post to put your tips into practice. You’re a star. Glad to help! For Travelers to Viet Nam,It is easy to buy a cheap cellphone such as Nokia, SamSung,LG,… with the price only 20- 30 USD. You can find the Phone Shop easily a long streets in the towns with signs of Nokia, IPhone, Samsung,…The micro Sim card for iphone also is sale very popular in these shops and they even can cut your normal Sim card to make it fix to your Iphone (the fee could be 1 USD or if you buy the cellphone from them they will do it for free).If you want to have more information, i am always ready to help.Thao Phan Thanks for the info! I haven’t yet been to Vietnam so that was definitely missing from this post! Hello, I will go to 4000 islands (Don Det) in South Laos, can I use my DTAC Thai SIM card there ? It’s close to the border. Nope 🙁 once you cross borders they stop working I’m back. Right, it’s not working. Bought a Laos SIM card for 2$. Hi Kristin, Just found your site while looking up suggestions for Simcards in Cambodia. We’ve been using our unlocked iphone4s and had the exact same scenario as you mentioned come up while in Bali; the amount of money coming off our cheap sim there didn’t seem to make sense! I’m glad I came across your site now as we are heading over to Vietnam in a week and I see you were just there! Awesome! Hope my suggestions help :). SIMs there are super cheap! They certainly did! I liked it so much, I even had to write a quick post about it Thank you. I finally got an iPhone 5s with an unlocked sim card. In Japan I never found one, but it is good to hear I could get one in other Asian countries. I do agree it is sort of fun to be off the grid, I used my iPad and email a lot when i travel. In the Philippines, it is also very easy and cheap to buy sim cards! I think around 50 Pesos, and you can top up your load. Texting is most common there and calling is more expensive. I don’t know about 3G, I did not really need it because many places have WiFi. I wanted it more for 3G and found one company very expensive and one was just fine. I think the cheaper one was World something. Multiple misinformations to me from Smart Internet and their agents resulted in pretty much my entire day wasted and still no decent internet connection. The worst of it was that much of their misinformation to me seemed to me to be quite deliberate and extremely blameworthy. Hi Kristin – Thanks for the helpful info, here and all over your site! I’m planning a year long trip to Australia (6-8 months), SE Asia (about 2 months) and Europe (2-4 months). I plan on disabling my Verizon account and using a site to unlock my iphone 5. Do you have a suggestion for getting a SIM card in Australia? Do you think this system will also work in Europe? Thank you 🙂 I always get SIMs everywhere I go, even now in Eastern Africa! I can’t recall who I used in Australia, honestly. Just ask the locals for the best company when you arrive, which is what I usually do. I have Samsung Note 3, a 4G LTE smartphone.VZW confirmed that all its 4G LTE smartphones are unlocked.  We confirmed that with different phones 2 Note 3 and 1 iPhone 5, with micro SIM purchased over many countries: Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Vietnam, and Italy.  With the exception in Vietnam where we used a local network, we used Vodafone micro SIM’s in all remaining countries.  We’re traveling to Thailand,  Indonesia,  Singapore, and Malaysia in August 2015, and we’re confident we’ll have no troubles using local micro SIM’s. Thank you for the details of different networks available in these countries, as well as their cost. There’s always a pair of scissors around to make a SIM fit as well. Hey Kristin, I’m wondering if you ever considered using T Mobile since they seem to have a pretty good deal with international travel.  Unlimited data and texting, .20 a minute to talk.  They are charging $60 a month for that, but does it make more sense to use local SIM cards?  Is there better service using local SIM cards? I have definitely considered it, but it’s almost universally more expensive than the SIM cards in the countries I’m traveling to. For example I paid $4 in Vietnam per Gigabyte of data. Greetings from Fiji. I am anindigenous. Hope you cover the south pacific…. There are thousands of islands to cover ? Whose beaches, Reefs and rainforest  will stop your heart.  And take your breath away.. Come try!!!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-eat-in-cambodia/,What to Eat in Cambodia and Where to Find It,Cambodia,"Each month, Jenn Brown from Jetsetter Jenn will write about what to eat, where to eat, and how to cook a dish from her favorite destinations abroad. In this post, she explains Cambodian cuisine and shares a recipe of one of her favorite Cambodian dishes.  Growing up in Southern California, I was always surrounded by the food of different cultures. The best carne asada came from the Spanish-speaking market, where I stretched my high-school vocabulary to the max. Una libra de carne asada por favor. Twenty minutes north, pho houses and Vietnamese bakery-coffee shops dotted every corner. Sushi bars, teppanyaki grills, dim sum, Korean BBQ, and Thai takeout were mainstays of my dining experience from a young age. But one cuisine was conspicuously absent, despite the abundance of south Asian dining options in every strip mall in my suburban homeland: Cambodian food.  So when I hopped off the plane in Siem Reap, fresh off a month of stuffing my face with all my favorite Thai curries, I had zero idea what to expect. My (limited) research told me that Cambodian food didn’t pack the punch of its culinary heavyweight neighbors on either side, so expectations were low.  Perhaps that’s why I was so wowed.  Here’s a tip: Do NOT believe any guidebook or blog that says Cambodian food leaves little to be desired. Sure, it may not have the chili obsession of southern Thailand or the wildly popular soups and sandwiches of Vietnam, but Cambodia offers its own unique blend of flavors that deserves reverence.  Most Cambodian cuisine is national — you will find similar menus in Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. However, each area will prepare these dishes slightly differently, and each restaurant has its own unique approach to these recipes. There is one region of Cambodia that has a proud place in the global culinary scene, and any foodie worth his or her salt should visit.  The French colonial influence is felt more strongly in these southeastern cities than the rest of Cambodia, through both the architecture, the makeup of the tourists, the the food. The rural farmland surrounding these two outposts is considered home to the highest-quality version of the most essential of seasonings: pepper. The humble peppercorn is elevated to new heights in the wide flatlands of the Kampot countryside, where it comes in pink, green, white, and black. It is revered by top chefs all over the world, and Kampot locals are fiercely proud of the plantations that dot the countryside.  And if you’re thinking to yourself: Pepper is just pepper. What the heck? No, this pepper is kissed by the gods. I swear it has a little extra spiciness, a little kick in the palate that makes your entire mouth sit up and listen to what the dish is saying to you. The fanciest French restaurants would only use Kampot pepper, and traditional steak au poivre required this exotic spice when Cambodia was a French colony. This pepper was the one thing I brought back from Cambodia with me, after being toted for six more months, and it was gone in less than three. Mosey a little further east to Kep, a seaside town famous for its crab, and suddenly a match in culinary heaven is born: Pepper Crab.  Pepper crab is made in Kep using green peppercorns, which are immature, unripened peppercorns that can’t be found outside of Cambodia because they dry out and the flavor changes after just a couple of days. Pepper crab consists of freshly-caught crab fried in a delicious garlicky-chili sauce that’s heavy on (you guessed it) pepper! One bite and the sweetness of the crab meat, the warmth of the chili and the kapow! kick of pepper will send your tatebuds to seafood heaven. Also worth trying in Kep are the myriad prawn dishes, served with yummy curries and lots of that famous Kampot pepper. Yum! Where to sample: Lonely Planet has made Kimly’s the most famous crab shack in Crab Shack Row, but some people complain that the quality has gone downhill and the sauce is too heavy. Diamond Jasmine and So Kheang Restaurant have gotten good marks from expats.  The most authentic way to try Kep crab? At the Crab Market itself! Haggle with Khmer saleswomen over the price and size of the crabs, which vary each day. Once you’ve purchased your crab, pay to get it boiled or fried onsite. After it’s cooked, purchase chili sauce and rice from kiosks in the market and sit down for a meal right there! Talk about fresh. It’s a crab-lover’s heaven.  Outside of Kep, there are plenty of dishes worth sampling while you’re in Cambodia. Here’s a shortlist of the ones you absolutely must try.  Often called the national dish of Cambodia, fish amok is a pretty little parcel of fish and thick yellow sauce in a banana leaf package. The sauce is a wondrous mixture of intense Asian flavors: several different types of ginger give it a hint of sweet spice, lemongrass and kaffir lime lend a jolt of tartness, and coconut milk gives it a creamy thickness that will coat your tastebuds in this heavenly mixture. Many restaurants offer this dish with chicken for fish-leery Westerners, but it tastes best with the most common Khmer protein: white fish.   Where to Try: For Life Restaurant in Siem Reap, Nary’s Kitchen in Battambang, Romdeng in Phnom Penh (Romdeng is also a social enterprise for disadvantaged youth. Win-win!) Where the fish is a light explosion of flavor, beef lok lak is a savory roundhouse kick to the mouth. The star of this dish is undoubtedly the beef, stir-fried in a thick brown sauce that’s the warm blanket of beef sauces. It’s served with a tangy lime-pepper dipping sauce that’s the perfect foil to the uber-savory beef. This was one of my favorite dishes in Cambodia, and one I recreated for friends and family at home with yummy success. Recipe is below if you want to try it too!  Where to Try: It’s hard to find a restaurant that can mess this dish up, but here are a few suggestions: Jack’s Place or Veronica’s Kitchen in Kampot, Genevieve’s in Siem Reap, Karma Restaurant in Phnom Penh. To get the most authentic version of this dish, seek out the women with buckets and pots dangling from a pole balanced over their shoulders. Those buckets contain the individual components of this dish: thin rice noodles, fresh veggies like cucumber, green beans, and bean sprouts, herbs like mint and basil, and a lemongrass green curry sauce to pour over the whole thing. When you order, the woman will put down the pole and make you a dish right there on the roadside. It’s a common breakfast meal in Cambodia, so look for it at morning markets.   Where to Try: Near the Central Market in Phnom Penh or the Old Market in Siem Reap.  Because this is Cambodia’s most popular breakfast, it’s tragically hard to find this dish after mid-morning. Tragic because this would be a delicious lunch and/or dinner as well! Sweet, caramelized BBQ pork is smothered in a garlicky-soy sauce, grilled over smoky charcoal, then sliced thin over rice and served with pickled veggies on the side. You might think savory when you look at it, but there is a sweetness in this marinade that makes it great for breakfast… think Asian-style maple bacon. You will do a happy dance after one bite of this simple-but-delicious meal.  Where to Try: Everywhere you go! I personally think street carts and market stalls are best for this one (especially the morning markets in Battambang or the local market [not Old Market] in Siem Reap), but Restaurant 126 in Phnom Penh gets packed with locals and sells out before 8 a.m., so it must be something special! There are two common types of curry in Cambodia, red and green. The red curry is more common than the green, but you can find both on most restaurant menus these days. Where Thai curries are heavy on the chili, Cambodian curry dials up the sweet factor. Still heavy on vegetables and aromatics like ginger, galangal, turmeric, and lemongrass, there’s also sweet potato, a strong dose of coconut milk, and a dash of sugar that makes it uniquely Khmer.   Where to Try: Khmer Kitchen in Siem Reap has a traditional and simple version, and Rikitikitavi in Kampot does good Khmer and Western food, so you can finish your curry with a ridonkulous brownie dessert (like I did) or slice of pie.  Cambodia is home to a few unique drink options that are worth a sample (and sometimes only a sample). Here they are:  Or as I call it: Cambodian Moonshine. The word wine seriously misrepresents this beverage! Here’s what it tasted like to me: Imagine the cheapest bottle of vodka you could finagle from the liquor store in high school. The one that was below the bottom shelf, cost $5, and was probably expired. Now toss that into a washing machine with a tablespoon of sugar and a load of dirty socks and put it on spin.  One small sip of this concoction screamed down my throat like a power-fart from Satan and enlarged my sinuses until an elephant could take a casual stroll through them.  When you try it, the Khmer will watch you sip with laughing eyes, waiting for the tears to form in your own. Then they will drink it like it’s no big thang, like your entire skull doesn’t get violently assaulted by this innocuous-looking clear liquid. Despite the trauma, it’s a must-try if you visit Cambodia, if only to say you drank it.  This is the cheapest and most prevalent beer option in Cambodia, and good luck getting out of Pub Street in Siem Reap without having at least a few of these! It’s a pretty basic lager (no craft brew flavor here), but it’s light enough to have several and tasty enough to get through before it gets warm. In the humid nights of Cambodia, that’s saying a lot!  For a non-alcoholic option, look for wheeled carts on the streets of Cambodia’s cities and towns with a mechanical press and several stalks of sugarcane. The drink is simply a fresh stalk of sugarcane, juiced through a hand-cranked press into a plastic bag with ice and a straw. You drink a sweet, delicate, cold drink immediately after it’s pressed, and in the humidity and heat of Cambodia it is heaven. I have no idea what the calories on these are, but it feels a little more honest than a Coca Cola. Sorry Coke lovers! Not traveling to Cambodia anytime soon? Bring these flavors to you! By far the easiest (and most widely crowd-pleasing) Cambodian dish to recreate in a Western kitchen is Beef Lok Lak. With ingredients common in most kitchens, you may not even need to run to the grocery store for this one. Win! Beef Lok Lak Serves 4 The marinade on the beef really makes the meat sing, and the dipping sauce gives the perfect acidic twang to an otherwise earthy dish. A high-heat stir fry style of cooking means this dish can be on the table in under 20 minutes, start to finish. Ingredients: Beef: 1 lb. beef, cut into 1-inch cubes 2 Tbsp vegetable oil + more for stir-frying 2 tsp chicken stock powder (e.g. Knorr) 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp salt 2 Tbsp soy sauce 2 Tbsp oyster sauce 2 Tbsp chili sauce (Heinz) or 1 Tbsp Sriracha & 1 Tbsp chili sauce* 2 Tbsp ketchup 2 tsp ground black pepper 6 cloves garlic, chopped Dipping Sauce: 3 – 4 limes, juiced Generous pinch of salt 1 tsp sugar 1 – 2 tsp ground black pepper Garnish (Optional): 4 eggs 6 leaves lettuce 2 tomatoes, sliced 1/2 onion, sliced Directions: Beef Lok Lak is typically eaten by spearing a chunk of meat, egg, and vegetable onto your fork, dipping in the sauce, and shoveling the whole mess into your mouth. It’s usually served with steamed rice. If you make at home, I suggest steamed rice and a salad with Asian-style dressing to accompany the meat. *You can sub Sriracha for all or part of the chili sauce in this dish. If you opt for 100% sriracha, it will be spicy. If you want traditional lok lak, use normal Heinz chili sauce, found at any grocery store. I do 50/50 and people love it!

I wonder if I could adapt the recipe you wrote up to a paleo/primal diet I think this series of articles about food is an excellent idea, especially combined with a recipe or two 🙂 I’ve just travelled Cambodia this summer and I have to say that overall I wasn’t wowed by the food… To my taste there’s just too much lemongrass in everything and most curries I had were more like soups 🙁 Although I agree with you on pepper and amok, those things are heaven. Love Cambodian food! Making this tonight. Used up the rest of my amok spices last week! Hi,You mentioned the humidity. What country had the worst humidity and what month was it? How do you deal with the constant sweating? I know you have to stay hydrated but was it miserable? Was it so bad that your clothing is soaked? How did you stay cool?Those are the two things I am concerned about, mossies and sweating lolThank youTammy Every country in SEA is pretty humid, though the rainy season in each country will be the hottest and wettest. Sweating and mosquito bites are kind of just part of it! Sometimes my clothing is soaked but usually I’m OK. Wow!! These pics are tempting me to explore Cambodia…Thanks for such an amazing blog!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-hostels-in-cambodia/,The Best Hostels in Cambodia,Cambodia,"Over the summer I wrote a series of posts about my favorite hostels and guesthouses in Vietnam and Thailand. I’m not sure why I stopped, because there are a lot more countries I’ve visited with quite a few more places I’d recommend you lay your head during your travels. I base my ratings and reviews of hostels on three main things: cleanliness, social atmosphere, and staff.  At most of the following hostels, I ended up meeting really amazing people, had a good experience with the staff, and found the rooms to be clean. Please keep in mind that I’m a budget-oriented traveler, who likes a good value for my money, meaning I won’t go for the cheapest, dirtiest option just to save a few bucks, but I won’t spring for a luxurious suite either. So, though a bit out of logical order since I’ve mainly been talking about Germany recently, here are my favorite places to lay one’s head in Cambodia: Siem Reap:  Mad Monkey The Mad Monkey in Siem Reap is my favorite hostel in Cambodia.  In fact, it might actually be my favorite hostel I’ve ever stayed in. Located 8km from Angkor Wat, it was close enough to cycle there for the sunset. The social atmosphere at the Top Banana bar and the friendly staff make this an easy place to stay for a week (or more!).  I met an amazing group of other backpackers here and, speaking with others who have stayed here, that seems to be a commonality. Apparently now they also have a pool! I would definitely recommend both the private rooms and the dorms here. Phnom Penh:  Mad Monkey Do you see a pattern here? The dorms, room pricing, and happy hour Angkor drafts were enough to keep me happy in the budget department, while the social atmosphere kept me coming back. Even if you don’t stay at the Mad Monkey, assuming it’s booked, it’s a great place to go for drinks and hanging out, meeting other travelers, and even the awesome staff who made a wonderful recommendation to me for my next stop in Otres Beach: Otres Beach, Sihanoukville:  Taste of Paradise When I stayed here and fell in love with Otres Beach, this place had no WIFI and was called Moonlight Rock. It has since upgraded and, as if it were even possible, is even better than before. Though basic, it’s absolutely perfect for enjoying the white-sand and crystal blue water at the beach and surrounding Otres Beach, which is the extremely laid-back, little skater brother of Serendipity beach in Sihanoukville. It’s a comfortable distance from the madness but still close enough for a night out, when desired. I loved the staff here, our memorable beach BBQs, and hanging out all together as one unit. As was common in Cambodia, I really felt like the staff, guests, and owners all meshed into one, which made it feel like home. *Tip: go swimming at night and marvel at the blue phytoplankton that follows you like blue glitter!  Rabbit Island Just go, and stay in a little hut Rabbit Island didn’t have WiFi when I was last there, or even running water, but it was so secluded that my friends and I pretty much had it to ourselves. Think barefoot jungle treks, massages on the beach for next to nothing money-wise, and when the generators go off at night, the perfect opportunity to swim in the glowing blue water. Kampot Mad Monkey I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but that’s because as a solo traveler in Cambodia, I met really cool people every time I stayed in a Mad Monkey hostel, and I am a fan of the art all over their walls as well. As a one-time hostel artist myself, it’s a certain kind of hostel that will welcome creative people and give them the freedom to cover the walls in their art. Plus, they have a pool. That’s a BIG plus in a country as hot and humid as Cambodia. Kratie River Dolphin Hotel This place is pricier than the others but whatever you do, make sure you do go to Kratie, you do rent a bicycle, and you do ride all around the little dirt roads throughout the small towns along the Mekong. It was my favorite thing I did the entire time (which was a month) that I spent in Cambodia. If you find yourself in Cambodia, and you definitely should, I hope you’ll give these a try and let me know what you think! If you liked this post, check out my suggestions for Thailand and Vietnam! *Post brought to you in collaboration with Mad Monkey hostels, because they’re awesome.  In Phnom Penh, I would recommend Envoy Hostel. It’s new, really clean and modern! I got some fantastic sleep there – I didn’t want to leave. Haven’t heard of that one so I can’t vouch for it but I really did enjoy Mad Monkey. Oh dear! Which was it? This post really comes at a wonderful time, thanks! I’m leaving for Cambodia in two weeks after I changed my plans this weekend from going to Malaysia to Cambodia and I’ve been reading all about it ever since.. I’ve been following you for quite a while now and I really like the way you write, (enjoyed your tips on the best books for traveling SEA as well, finished little princess and about to start ‘first they killed my father’) so I thought it was about time to leave a little thank you for all your tips! Hope you enjoy South-Africa, I’ve worked in a little provincial hospital in Hermanus for a few months and thought it was a stunning, yet difficult country.. Thanks so much for your kind words and I’m glad that you’ve found my blog helpful! That’s a great book to choose since you’re heading into Cambodia. I hope you’ll let me know how your time in Cambodia goes, especially if you take any of these suggestions! Happy travels I love everything about Mad Monkey– rooms, athmosphere, and the bar! Great place for solo travelers. Agreed! Cambodia has the best deals on hostels! I have a few recommendations as well:Battambang – Here Be Dragons – $8 for a double ensuite!! Amazing staff and sweet bar downstairs (and we aren’t young 20 something parties, so we don’t usually go for a bar/hostel combo, but this place just had a really chill vibe)Kampot – Green House, very relaxed huts / restaurant on the river, and unlike other backpacker accommodations on the river no late night booming house musicKep – Bacoma, best $10 bungalow I’ve ever rested in. I’ve heard that. Might check it out if I can swing it in May. I’m absolutely loving this series. I’ll be doing my first completely solo adventure in SEA in a couple of months and your posts have been so helpful! Glad you have found it helpful! I am working on a few other countries as well 🙂 Hey, I’m going to Cambodia in March and loved your ‘ultimate backpacking vietnam route’-article and wanted to ask if you could tell me which route you took in Cambodia? I should write one for cambodia too! Siem Reap -> Phnom Penh -> Otres Beach -> Kep -> Kampot -> Rabbit island -> Phnom Penh -> Kratie -> Banlung -> North to Don Det, Laos    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-books-for-traveling-in-asia/,The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia,Cambodia,"Reading is where I get the majority of my enjoyment these days. Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships. This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads. This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:    First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers by Loung Ung This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today.  It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading. It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.  Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute by Bua Boonmee First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is incredibly eye-opening. I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the Thai sex industry have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.  Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam by Andrew X. Pham This book was a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me. I personally really loved visiting Vietnam. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.  Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal by Conor Grennan Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal. Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family. Sold by Patricia McCormick Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world  in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change. (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)  What Makes You Not a Buddhist by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse The title of this book really is misleading.  It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger. I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a 10-day silent meditation in Thailand. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding. This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.  I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone! A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack. It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn. — I read all of my books on a Kindle because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books. Given I’m usually reading 2-3 at a time, I need them in electronic format. Plus, I can keep highlights and clippings of the books for later reference – which I do make use of. I am always looking to add to this list, so if you know of a great read, let me know! Lastly, these are affiliate links, which means if you make a purchase via the link, I get a very small percentage of the sale price. It’s not much but it does help me maintain this website. Now that I think about it, if you have someone special in your life that is traveling soon, one of the best gifts would be these books loaded on a Kindle. Just a thought! Happy travels.   I love this because I always try to read a book about the place I’m traveling to/in. I also appreciate that you highlighted books written by people who actually live or are from those countries. I think both  perspectives (insider vs outsider) are good, but I always tend to lean to the home country authors. Last, I read Catfish and Mandala about 10 years ago and I still remember how good it was! Which is at lot considering I often can’t remember books I read last year:) I like the first-hand narrative style of people from the countries as well. Sometimes it’s an outsider who wrote it as in the cases with the Nepal books, but the others gave me a better insight, I felt. Hi,I was going through the comments, and saw your reply asking for the affiliate link of the book Nothing to Envy. I will take this opportunity to send the link to youHere’s the link:Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea I loved your website and articles. You are doing a great job! Thanks and thanks! “The Red Market” by Scott Carney.By no means is this an uplifting book either but it does show you a dark world hidden within some countries like India, Philippines, & China.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061936463 It’s important to understand all aspects, I think. Not just the good parts. Thanks for the recommendation! Ah, amazing! I was just thinking one of my aims for my trip next year should be to read at least one book about each country I visit. This is a great selection to get me started. Wish I had some recommendations for you, I plan to have many by the end of my trip! Great then I look forward to your eventual recommendations! I know a must-read for Myanmar- From the Land of Green Ghosts http://www.amazon.com/From-Land-Green-Ghosts-Burmese/dp/0060505230 Awesome, thank you! Thank you, Kristin for your great list of book. Next week I will go to Myanmar and I was glad find book about this country in comment to this post. Now I read “From the Land of Green Ghosts” and expect very interesting travel. I just love the commenters on this blog! They’re so helpful. Anything on China? I’m heading there in a few days. I’ve been reading China in Ten Words by Yu Hua, which has been a fairly easy read and talks about the author’s upbringing during the Cultural Revolution, among other things. I’m definitely going to check out What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Thanks! I’ve read a lot of textbooks about China, especially modern Chinese politics (it was an area of study for me at University) but not as many memoirs. A good friend of mine loves My Several Worlds by Pearl S. Buck. There’s a novel called To Live by Yu Hua that you might find very interesting. It’s about a formerly rich family’s struggle as Mao rises to power. There actually are a lot of memoirs about China, too many of them. The most popular ones are Peter Hessler’s books, works by Xinran, Wild Swans, Wild Grass, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. I personally recommend Ancestral Leaves by Joseph W. Esherick, which chronicles his wife’s family through most of Modern Chinese history. As a historian, he knows his facts. Many of them focus on the turbulence of the Mao Era or the strains on society caused by the neck-breaking  pace of development. Pearl S. Buck, writes from the Republican era. Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a good place to start for contemporary Chinese literature. He works tend to be a bit political and focus on Chinese society. Soul Mountain, also by a Chinese Nobel laureate for literature, Gao Xingjian, is in contrast a much more personal journey and doesn’t touch much on the social upheavals of the era. The Republican era was a golden era for Chinese arts and literature. Writers from that era, such as Lu Xun, Xiao Hong, Ba jin, Qian Zhongshu, and Lao Shu, are still deeply revered in modern Chinese society. Thanks so much for the suggestions, Paul! It’s clear to me now that I should have been reading a lot more books on China all along. It’s the country that fascinates me the most. Will definitely add some of these to my list of books to read and hopefully grow this post to include some of these. Oh, totally love this post. I’m always looking for books or movies that have the places I want to see in them. Great idea. 🙂 I absolutely adore The Lover for Vietnam. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Adapted from a book as well which I suppose I should have included here as I’ve read that one too but forgot about it until now! I’ve just started ‘Anil’s Ghost’ by Michael Ondaatje which touches on Sri Lanka during their civil war. So far I really love it – perhaps I am slightly biases since I was there in September and have a huge love for the country, but I would say it’s worth reading! I do as well since I was there about a year ago. Thanks for letting me know because I’d love to learn more about that beautiful island. Great list Kristen! I haven’t read Miss Bangkok, Sold, or What Makes You Not  Buddhist, but the others are great and really do have a lasting imrpession, especially when you read them in the country they’re set in. 🙂Reading books about different countries and their history, and other travellers’ account of their adventures is one of my favourite parts of travel!! You’ve read all the others? Nice! I guess great minds think alike. Out of those I’d recommend What Makes You Not Buddhist next, but that is my favorite book so I’m biased 🙂 For fiction, the Bangkok 8 series is interesting and entertaining. Certainly not an accurate representation of Thailand in general, but the author does highlight several finer points of Thai Buddhist practices and cultures that are fascinating and interesting to read about if you’ve spent some time there. I really enjoy books about Buddhism so I might like that one a lot. Ahhh thank you for the reminder that I have been meaning to read “First They Killed My Father” for three years now since first visiting Cambodia! Added it to the list. Great, great read. I just read a great book set in India, by Kiran Desai, called Hullabaloo In The Guava Orchard. A really easy, funny read, with engaging characters and great descriptive prose. Of course for fiction, there’s always Memoirs Of A Geisha, too, which I LOVE. One I really recommend is called Nothing To Envy, by Barbara Demick. There are accounts of six defectors who escaped North Korea during the massive famine that killed millions in the 90’s. Such a good book about a country that we don’t know that much about. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha as well! I read it in high school.  THANK YOU for the Nothing to Envy suggestion. I think I’ll read that next because N. Korea really fascinates me. If you have an affiliate link with amazon send it over 🙂 What a great list of books. Thanks! I think I’d start with the What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Its a great one to start with One of my absolute favorite books has always been Shantaram. I recommend it to everyone! Its a beautiful autobiography (some ppl do challenge this) of a convict from Australia who escaped prison and ran off to India. He really writes beautifully about living in the country and his adventures there.  And then of course if you want a lighter take on India, there’s always Holy Cow that helps balance off the two experiences =) I did read Shantaram and while I felt the guy was a good writer I just couldn’t get past his god complex. It bothered me. It did help me get a better feel for India (I guess?) but I didn’t love it enough for it to make the list. It was a compelling read, though. I give it a 6 out of 10. There are some great books here! Some of my favourites are A Fine Balance (India), Wild Swans (China), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan) and Ghostwritten (set in many locations, but the Mongolia story is my favourite). Maybe I should write my own post! Thanks for the recommendations! Looks like I need to do some China reading. Thanks for this list! I’m living in bangkok at the moment and really wanted some reading inspiration! What makes you not a Buddhist is honestly one of the most amazing books I’ve read, I’m going to spread the word it’s very rare to find something so grounded in fact and truth yet so magical at the same time. Keep doing what you’re doing – I love your blog! Xx Yay! I’m glad you liked the book! It really did change my life for the better. Oh, this brings back memories. I always used to try to read a book set in another country before I got there/while I was travelling around. I’m not quite sure when I got out of the habit. I’d like to do it again, though. Thanks for the inspiration! Always such a nice way to understand and appreciate a country’s history 🙂 I love to read about places that I’ve been too. I read a LOT of China books because it helps me grasp the country a bit more. You should check out Peter Hessler’s books – he’s an awesome writer. I’m really curious about the Buddhism book, it would be nice to learn a bit more. Awesome thank you. I think you’re the second to comment recommending Holy Cow so I’ll look that one up. The other sounds incredible as well. Thanks for the great list, I am excited to check these out. I always try to read books when traveling in a country – I feel like it gives so much great context and cultural understanding that you don’t always get just by interacting with locals. Here are a few that I found useful – for Cambodia – Report from the Stricken Land; for China – easily the best travel companion is China Road by Rob Gifford (also available as an excellent audio book); and for India – Inspite of the Gods – the rise of Modern India. All of these were written by journalists who covered these countries for decades and have plenty of anecdotes, historical knowledge and well rounded understanding of a range of subjects pertinent to these countries. Those are great suggestions! A lot on this list are written by locals but it would be great to get a journalist’s perspective as well. Thank you for the incredible list its helpful.. Great suggestions! I loved Catfish and Mandala! Although its not as deep and insightful… No touch monkey was a great lighthearted traveler’s book for southeast asia (and other parts of the world)… definitely recommend for a light read 🙂 Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely agree with the title at least! Thanks for the recommendation for: What Makes You Not a BuddhistGreat description and awesome read. Just finished the book this avo! Awesome I’m so glad you liked it! I was excited to see that a lot of people ordered that one. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone read it 🙂 I read “When Broken Glass Floats” while in Phnom Penh which is a similar memoir to First They Killed My Father. I had planned to read them both, but after the first one, I didn’t think I could handle reading about that tragic history again. The book reduced me to tears more than a few times, and like you say, made me appreciate the smiles and hospitality around the country so much more. The other books you’ve listed look great as well, Miss Bangkok looks powerful, and Bkk is one of my favourite cities ever – might have to read that one on my next plane ride there. Thanks! I cried too reading First They Killed My Father. I agree it might be tough to read two such memoirs back to back. I started reading one about a child soldier in Sierra Leone and wondered to myself why I read such tough books but then realized, it helps you appreciate the current situation much more and the need for love in this world more than ever. Hi Kristin, Did you use a travel guide in south east Asia? Awesome website by the way, inspiring and useful! X iris Nope. I never do. I get my ideas by talking to locals. Orwell’s first novel, Burmese Days, paints Colonial Burma in a satirical light and offers decent insight into old traditions such as chewing betel. It’s worth reading just to see Orwell’s nearly century old take on present day Myanmar as well as his stunning insights into the bureaucratic nonsense that came along with it. Thank you for the recommendation! Hi there, I really enjoyed reading your past updates and most recent post 🙂 I was recommended your blog by transient20s. I have just started on WordPress since I am just beginning my travels – not only to keep my own recording of the journey, but also to read other people’s recommendations and insights. Some of the stuff I have read so far is great and I would love if you had any other recommended bloggers etc for me to follow? I am 23 and my first post lists the places I will be visiting. Thank you! Rebecca x How kind of them to recommend me. Yes for sure! These are my faves: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-blogs/ I’ve always considered “The Beach” a must read for anyone visiting Asia, but I love your list. Will definitely try to read at least one of those books this year! I haven’t actually read it but based on the movie, can definitely see why. I was trying to think of things that are less based on fiction and more based on the culture of the countries, but should read that one as well. If you are travelling India I absolutely recommend “The God of Small Things” for some beautiful magic realism and accurate “images” of local kids. And of course I have to recommend the famous “the white tiger” also full of indian typical images and very very entertaining reading. Both Indian writers Would love to read them regardless! I love having a peek into a culture I’m not yet familiar with Yep, Catfish and Mandala is a good one. I read it long before I ever wen to SE Asia, but remember it as a compelling read. So compelling and well-written. I love reading people who are such great writers as they encourage me to improve. I loved Little Princes! I recently did a Buddhist temple stay here in Korea and loved my time there. I’ll definitely have to check out “What makes you not a Buddhist” as I really want to learn more about the religion.Thanks for the recommendation!Some of my favourites are Escape from camp 14, a book about one of the few people to have escaped from North Korea’s prisoner camps. A shocking but interesting read (although it came out recently that he had lied about a few things in the book)Into Thin Air is also a great read! I am so fascinated by North Korea so I’m definitely going to give that a read. Thank you for the suggestion! Are there book about Malaysia and How long can I use these book? I haven’t read one about Malaysia yet but when I do I’m happy to post about it! These are mostly memoirs and relevant any time. Thanks for the awesome list! I am definitely going to check them out, especially the one about Buddhism. When I’m in Thailand later this year I am going to check out a meditation retreat in a temple, so I should probably learn more about Buddhism first. 😛 That’s a really good idea and I was very glad I’d read that book prior to going simply to have the basics down when the monks referenced the Truths.  Is it this one you’re going to? Was a very profound experience for me: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/monastery-thailand/I have some tips to help you prep here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/suan-mokkh/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chillest-places-asia/,The 8 Chillest Places in Asia,Cambodia,"When you imagine the most peaceful place you’ve ever been, what comes to mind? I’ve been to places where, whether it’s because of a hippie vibe, a genuine feeling of peace, or just the amazing people around me (usually all three), it just feels chill, and I feel like I could stay there forever. I came to realize over time that these are the places I like the most. They’re usually small communities, very focused on the preservation and appreciation of nature, and the general feeling is one of calm. Here are the best of what I’ve discovered so far: Even the name, Ella, sounds all magical and beautiful. In Ella, plenty of bars and restaurants have lounge lofts with bean bags, coffee stops, and your typical corner roti man serving up meals for under a dollar. The train ride to or from this beautiful town is breathtaking as well (get the spot in the doorway!). Ella itself is full of waterfalls, wonderful hiking, and is bordered by tea plantations on both sides. I’ve said it before and will say it again: it’s some sort of unspoken rule that anywhere with tea plantations will and must be beautiful. Yubeng is located in the far west of China, right up against Tibet in Yunnan province. It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a sacred area and all along the trail to Yubeng prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it. I talk about Pai all the time. In life, in this blog, in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day. I could visit the Land Split, swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon. The thought has often crossed my mind to take up a longer term residence there at some point. Speaking of hippie paradises, Otres Beach in Cambodia might be the winner, at least when I was there a little over two years ago. Most visitors who spend a while there have the same routine: wake up, swim, have some muesli and green tea, buy a mixed bag of small and sweet banana, mango and pineapple from the fruit lady, have a few Anchor beers, swim, consider BBQ or a bonfire, rinse, repeat. Why not? It’s paradise incarnate with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water. Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared. It’s easy to laze away in Don Det, reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world. I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali. Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street. Dali is relaxed, it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it. Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous. Discovered by accident when I was entranced by the look of Tonsai on my way to Railay (I asked the boat man to take me back to Tonsai once I’d seen it, please and thank you), I’ve returned and just love the chill vibe and beautiful surroundings. Tonsai is also an active place, full of kayakers, divers, rock climbers, fire dancers ,and slack-line walkers. It’s the perfect place to pick up a new skill, or to just laze around by the beach and read books. This was my favorite part of Vietnam because the locals flashed peace signs at me as I rode by on my motorbike, families watched fascinated and waved from their porches, and and old lady sat on my bike with me, stroked my face, and then rested for a while as we just sat there in relaxed silence. It was all quite strange and amazing. There’s really only one road through the town and not a whole lot of noise or business around. This makes for a really peaceful, agricultural, and naturally beautiful place. I definitely felt calm and in my natural element while at Phong Nha. — Those are my personal favorites, but there are an infinite number of chill places to find, no doubt, and what is chill is usually a bit undiscovered, so the chillness level does change often. Regardless, when I look back on my travels, these are the places I tended to enjoy the most and to find the most like-minded people. Coincidentally they are all naturally beautiful. What would you add to the list? I’m always on the hunt for the next peaceful, quiet, mellow destination.   Hi Kristin,First thanks for the list: after 7 years, I will be back in Southeast Asia in a few days for 4 months, and 2 of the places you list are actually on my list (never been there before): Phong Nha Ke Bang & Otres Beach. I was actually scared Otres Beach would be awfully touristy!In a completely different way, the last place I found really relaxing and inviting to slow down in Asia was Turtuk, in the Nubra Valley in Ladakh.CheersGilles It’s possible it has become more touristy since I was last there – in fact I’m sure it is. If you really want something more remote you can head to Rabbit island off of Kep in Cambodia. They didn’t actually have running water or even electricity when I was last there, so I’m guessing things may have upgraded slightly since then. Would love to hear your thoughts after you go to Otres! Thanks Kristin!I will let you know and of course write about it.I am concerned about the masses especially since I will be there over Xmas.CheersGilles Please add the name of each country. The name of each country is listed right next to the name of the city. Ella is in Sri Lanka, Pai is in Thailand, etc. Hoi An is very pretty. I’ve heard great things about Khao Sok! Otres Beach was definitely a highlight of my Asia trip. I met some awesome people there and we enjoyed low key days on the beautiful beach and then BBQ and (50 cent) beers after the sun set. Perfect. I also really liked Don Det and Pai so it seems like we have similar tastes. I’ll have to check out the rest the next time I’m in Asia. I think the beach BBQ I had on Otres was the best I’ve ever had. The meat was so good and we ate it all with our hands. I just love eating with my hands, to be perfectly honest. I would also add Chitwan in Nepal and also Battambang in Cambodia. Unbelievable laid back and peaceful for a small city! Thanks! I should check those out as I haven’t been to either one. “It just feels chill” – Ok, you couldn’t have said it better. Great suggestions and i love the photos (hanging out in Pai is my favourite). Haha, it’s a feeling, you know? Awesome! If you hit any of these I think you’ll be pleased with the vibes. These place are all really nice, but if you reaaaally want to chill out I’d say head to Central Asia! Like Khorog in Tajikistan, or Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. So laid back! So many people have suggested that lately and I’ve heard great things. They’re on the list now. Aahhh I am ALL about the chill places! Def adding these to my list for my RTW next year. Thank you! 🙂 Nothing better than a great chill place! It’s now my mission to visit as many of these places as I can on my trip to Asia next year. Thanks for sharing them! That’s awesome! Let me know how it goes please! Dali is the only place I really want to visit in China…met a couple who owns a hotel there and it just sounds magical There are so many other amazing places in China worth visiting as well, especially around Dali. Let me know if you ever make it out there! Khao Sok in Thailand was incredible.. I had to return a few months later! I will go back as well. I agree with Don det, so relaxed. Great post, gives me some ideas for the future Thanks for letting me know about Khao Sok. I want to check it out! Hi you should try Easter island its Amazing i sat at the higest point on the island, then it hit me there is No one higher than me for 3500km wow .. That’s very cool! Her Kristin,This is a real cool post. I liked it so much I reposted on my blogs facebook page 🙂 I thought I would have been to more but have only been to 3 places on this list! I think Tonsai Beach was my favourite chillest place thus far! A couple of cool chill places in India would be McLeod Ganj (gorgeous tibetan town in the foot of the Himalayas), Palolem Beach in Goa ($3 private beachfront cananas – yes please!) and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (go and stay in a castle for a few days eating amazing foods while watching the sun set from the roof of the castle). Have you been to any of these? Awesome, thank you! Thanks so much for giving me India tips! I am really looking forward to the time when I take off for an extended trip through there. Yes, Ella does sound very pretty and serene… And Pai? We’ve not heard of that before in Thailand. Another chill spot is Gili Air (one of the Gili islands off Lombok, Indonesia) – but don’t go to neighboring Gili T if you’re looking for “chill” as that’s quite a party island! We loved Koh Lanta in Thailand – found it very restful. But we hear a bridge is being built to connect it to Krabi, so rumour has it that the island may not stay so peaceful for long… I went to Gili T for a week right at the end of my first 10 months in SEA and have to say I really enjoyed it! I know it’s a party place but better for a solo traveler. I think Gili Air would have been awesome with a partner but my friend came back and said solo it was a little depressing.  You haven’t heard of Pai?! I’m obsessed with Pai! Go forth and visit! Thanks Kristin for exploring some best places of Asia through this post. Thanks for reading 🙂 Great post! I would love to check out Don Det, Laos. It seems like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. You’re website is pretty amazing. Hope my blog can be half as good as yours one day. That’s really kind of you, David! I would say you could be right assuming Don Det is like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. It’s still its own thing and its own place but both are worth checking out. Both are beautiful. Hi Kristin,I am headed to Southeast Asia in a few months but will only be able to stay for a little over a month. I am starting in Thailand and ending in Bali with a final night in Singapore. I am hoping to be efficient and get to see parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia as well. Any suggestions on how to make the most of your time while backpacking and ensure you get to see everything on your list? (Not your list specifically, just a list in general :-)) Any advice would be awesome!Thanks,Jordan You’re a bit limited with that timeframe and I’m sure you don’t want to burn yourself out with rapid movement, so I’d suggest seeing Angkor Wat in Cambodia, checking out an island such as Perhentian or Tioman in Malaysia, and exploring Hanoi and the surrounding areas in Vietnam, as those were the highlights for me and I bet you’d be pretty happy with those spots. So glad to hear it’s still good because I would like to return in May 🙂 Gah! I miss Pai so much and it was by far my favorite place in Thailand to visit. The hammocks, the sunsets, the night market, and the freakin’ food! I never made it to Tonsai but I’ll have to hit that next time I’m in Thailand. I feel like we are very alike in places we love to chill, so when I do finally get to Sri Lanka and China and the like, I’ll make it a point to check these out! we probably do have similar taste! Pai is always a wonderful place to be. I love your posts! And since I read the articles about Pai I just want to go there like immediately 🙂 in 2 weeks it is gonna be so far 🙂 Could you please share, where I can find this chill terrace from your Pai picture?  Wish you lots of fun on your further trips!! Thanks Maria! The photo is at the Container. OTRES BEACH brings back some serious ‘chill’ memories. Its amazing how its right down then way from the ‘main’ beach but its literally deserted.   Great choice! Glad to hear it’s still like that because I plan to return after 2.5 years away in May! Hi Kristin!I really enjoy your post, I ran into your blog for I will embark on my first solo trip in a couple months. I’ll be heading to Pai and I just love the picture you posted for Pai. Do you mind telling me the place. The one with the beautiful scenery and hanging chairs. Thanks It’s called the Container 🙂 HelloWhere in Pai is the photo with the swinging chairs taken? I’d love to go!K It’s called the Container, near Coffee in Love Hi, I will be travelling to southeast Asia in a couple weeks. Where are the hanging egg shaped seats in Pai? Thanks The Container Hello, is a great article. I hope sometimes i will visit Asia because is such a great place and i like their food Always wanted to visit Asia. And your post makes me want to make it happen more. Thank you! c”,) Indeed, Pai and the Land Split, are quite the Chill places! The snacks and beverages on those hammocks had me feeling like I was just floating on a cloud. I can still taste that yummy tamarind…mmmMMM. Hi Kristin! I’ll be back to Asia next year, and this is absolutely gold to include in my plans, thank you! I know you focus mainly in Southeast Asia, but if you ever decide to change destination, you could try Costa Rica 🙂 Puerto Viejo and Montezuma, even if are touristic places, have that chill vibe that make you question if you should leave everything to just live there! Thanks for the great post! I went through Costa Rica once for a week when I was in my early 20s and hit Belize the year after that for the same length of time. I’d love to move slowly through Central America the way I did through Southeast Asia. I’ve heard it’s a great place for slow travel as well Great post and I agree with otres being the best! I lived there for a while but do make sure you choose otres 2 not 1. kampot (a couple of hours) away is also amazing! Found some new gems from this for the next travels though. Great article. Thanks 🙂 There are 2 now? I figured it had started to grow…    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/15-reasons-to-love-cambodia/,15 Quirky Things to Love About Cambodia,Cambodia,"1) “Hello!” I felt like Miss America riding around the smaller provinces in Cambodia, waving and singing hellos to hundreds of adorable children who ran out of their little shacks, happy as clams, at the first sight of me. I’m not sure why they wanted to say hello so badly, but they totally made my day with their excitement and beautiful smiles. 2) $10 glasses, in 15 minutes! They may have googly eyes on the side, and they my break easily, turning into one-armed glasses, but who doesn’t love that kind of timeliness on the cheap!? Want some of your own? Take a look around Phnom Penh. 3) Blingin’ teeth Many dental offices in the bigger cities offer teeny, tiny little gems that women of means can implant in their teeth.  Imagine that! 4) Khmer BBQ One of my favorite memories from Otres Beach is the night my entire guest house got together, dug a pit in the sand, laid a grill on top, and BBQ’d fresh pork, red snapper, chicken, and shrimp.  We didn’t have plates, or utensils.  We balled up the rice and ate everything with our hands, Khmer style. I had never tasted pork that soft before.  I looked around at the beautiful surroundings and felt so happy, even without tables, plates, and forks.  Who needs those, anyways? 5) Houses on stilts I used to think that shacks on stilts were a pretty awful sight.  After spending many nights in similar shanties, I have to say, all you really need is some shelter, and a mosquito net, and life in Cambodia is all good. 6) A for honesty I guess if you’re going to blatantly overcharge me, I appreciate you doing it honestly. 7) “Same same, but different” The term used to sell you something that is in no way the same as what you’re actually looking for. 8) Deep fried tarantulas What’s not to love about deep fried goodness, I ask you? 9) Pedicures and threading on the beach It was after getting a full pedicure for $2, and leg threading for $4 that I realized my favorite spa in the world would have to be on the white-sand beaches of Cambodia.  I ask you, where else can you get this done on the sand for that cheap? 10) Petrol out of Bacardi bottles At first, I didn’t realize what it was.  Then, I saw people pouring yellow Bacardi and Pepsi into their motorbikes, and the lightbulb went off in my head – it’s fuel! Recycling at its best. 11) Luc Lac Fried beef strips with Kampot pepper sauce, tomatoes, rice, onion, AND egg? Sold. 12) Untamed islands and barefoot trekking I headed out to the islands that border Cambodia for a few days during my time on the coast.  It was easier to trek around in bare feet than with flip flops on, given the often deep and thick mud. I thought to myself on several occasions, “I’m seriously walking through a jungle barefoot right now.” Mother would be so proud of the little heathen she raised. 13) Bus issues They are plentiful on the God-awful roads in Cambodia, but what can you do other than laugh? 14) Over packed mini-busses In the smaller provinces, one really can’t avoid ending up in a mini bus stuffed with 25+ people, their produce, rice, and purses, in a van that was meant to hold about half that amount of people. People will fall asleep on your shoulder, and you’ll feel a little bad that their heads keep rising and slamming down on your bony shoulder as you go over the potholes in the road (or is it just me who has the boniest shoulders ever?) 15) Angkor Wat at Sunset Only one country in the world offers this amazing wonder.  The crowds may overtake the temples at sunrise, but sunset is a truly magical experience. Have you been to Cambodia? What did you love about it? What did I miss? Addendum: I completely forgot Angry Birds mania! It’s on the shirts, hats, underoos, absolutely everywhere! I guess That means this is now a list of 16 things.  Deal with it.  I miss that food. You should probably just come to SE Asia and hang out 🙂 Leg threading? OUCH. You’re brave!! Yeahhh I had never done threading before so I agreed before I knew how it felt.  Never again! Fingers crossed I get to Cambodia soon… this post just made me want to go EVEN more, if that’s possible! Oh good! You’ll have a blast! Deep fried tarantulas?!?! Can anybody say TERRIFYING. I was thinking to myself…would I eat that…then NO BECAUSE IT WILL COME ALIVE AGAIN IN MY STOMACH AND DEVOUR ME FROM THE INSIDE. I can only fixate on that horrible thought. And also the awesome glasses with the googly eyes. Oh man, your comment made me literally LOL. Awesome The Khmer BBQ is super! I can confirm. Cambodia is my favorite country – so pleasant people, cheap food – beer at Pub street -Siem Reap and stunning Angkor Wat, I would like to back again ! http://www.villa-sunrise.com/ The Ray Bans made me laugh. You should definitely sell those babies on eBay! I am heading to Cambodia in just over a month.  I will be working for a month in Battambang.  Really enjoying your blog.  Can you really Get prescription glasses in 15 minutes? You really can. My thing with Cambodia is that I either found it fascinating or really disliked the experience… And that sometimes within the same day 🙂 Do you have to know your prescription for them to make them? Or do they test you somehow? Thank you. You could probably get tested for your eyes at the same shop.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cambodia-has-me-completely-smitten/,Cambodia Has Me Completely Smitten,Cambodia,"Day 34 Day by day I fall more intensely in love with Cambodia.  Each place I encounter is more beautiful and impressive than the last, and that’s saying a lot considering I started with Siem Reap – home to Angkor Wat. Some people say that Thailand is the land of smiles, but I suspect they haven’t been to Cambodia. Kids wave to me and shout “hello!” and flash their beautiful smiles on a daily basis. And they really are glowing, beautiful smiles. They chase after me on my bike, sometimes racing me on their way home from school in their long skirts and white, sleeved shirts. The dirt roads are full of potholes, but it only adds to the friendly competition. If I smile at a local and say hello, he always smiles a warm, genuine, beautiful smile back to me and waves.  It warms my heart they way they’ve welcomed me. Considering the hardship and genocide these people went through so recently, so many of them experiencing it first hand, it’s so humbling to see the way they love life, even with so little by way of possessions and money. It’s like each day here provides a new lesson to be learned about the beauty of life and how to appreciate it. I haven’t had a hot shower in weeks – I don’t even remember what they feel like anymore.  Nowadays, the cold water is welcome after a hot day covered in a glaze of deet and humidity. I’ve done nothing but share rooms, usually full of bunk beds, for nearly the full month I’ve been traveling.  My bed often consists of a slightly sandy and damp mattress with a mosquito net covering – usually a holey one.  If I encounter soap in a bathroom I’m completely astounded and delighted.  I can’t remember what air conditioning feels like.  I sometimes don’t even have a fan or electricity for most of the day.  I spent a good chunk of this month in a damp existence covered in sweat, sea-water, or some mixture of the two. The best part? I couldn’t care less.  I’ve gladly traded all of the comforts of Western life for this Cambodian lifestyle and I don’t miss them at all.  I look at my makeup bag and laugh now.  There’s no way that’s going on my face. I’m kind of shocked at how little I really need to be happy.  Is this what traveling does to people?  I think so. Every day here is like a new intense high.  I wake up and pinch myself, completely understanding how some travelers come here planning on a few weeks, and end up staying for months, or even years. My time in Cambodia has sadly come to an end, which makes my heart ache.  However, I have to get up to Laos, get through that beautiful country, most likely fall in love again, and make it up to Chiang Mai for the lantern festival.  Besides, there’s a big world out there for me to see. Trust me, Cambodia, I’ll be back for you.  You will see me again.  I’ll wear this place like a thumb print on my heart forever.  It has changed me. For the better. Absolutely for the better. You and Mr. TheWorldOrBust have me utterly convinced that I have to figure out a way to visit Cambodia—and I hear Laos casts a similar spell on visitors. My days of shared bunk rooms, no AC or fan and holey mosquito netting are probably over (and I’m not that sorry about that ;-)), but hopefully traveling sharing a room only with my spouse and with intact mosquito netting won’t spoil the magic. You can get some pretty nice hotels for next to nothing! Something tells me an intact mosquito net would have been even more magical. Now I will be dreaming of Cambodia, it seems so amazing. I love the shot you took of the spires on the roof, also! I’m still dreaming about it! Okay your pictures look terrifying.. the colours looks like some Tim Burton film that I really want to be in. Awesome! Haha, thanks? Bit of editing made it look that way. You have me more and more convinced to make it over to Cambodia ASAP! I knew I wanted to go to Thailand for sure, but now I have to add Cambodia – it sounds amazing! Definitely go! It’s so beautiful. It was a gorgeous place years ago when we first visited. The people were amazing however a few of them were a little over zealous whenever we pulled out western money. That can happen whenever there is an economic disparity so we never held it against them. Some of our greatest memories of the place were of the kids who followed us around all the time. They had smiles that provided a stark contrast with their history and the gorgeous, sometimes forboding, temples that litter the countryside. When you see happiness in someone with so little it can’t help but redefine your view on the world. Good post! I would agree there were times when I had to argue someone down on price or just walk away when I knew I was getting overcharged, but I think that’s just how it is when you’re a traveler in poor places.  Didn’t turn me off, though. I’m so jealous and happy for you that you’re loving your travels! Can’t wait to meet up with you in spring! <3 Yay can’t wait! I am one of those who need to visit Cambodia.  I have hope I will be able to visit one day (I have to start saving). You don’t have to save much.  I found plenty of $2 dorms! I’d love to go to Cambodia. I’m sure it’s way better than Thailand. I thought it was far too touristy. You could barely get a feel for the local culture there… I’ll have to let you know – I am heading to Thailand next month. I think you’ve just got to get out of the city to get to know the country you’re in. Thank you for this! I’m in Vietnam now, headed to Thailand next, planning to double back through to Cambodia. You’ve gotten me really excited. So, see ya in Chiang Mai?? 😉 Possibly! Will be there in November Hey ,, I am going to Cambodia next week. Do you have any hostels that you can recommend,, I have  a slight idea about where to go now but it would be great to get some recommendations? 🙂 Thankyou Mad Monkey in Siem Reap was awesome when I was there.  11 Happy backpackers and the white rabbit are both good in PP. In Otres Beach I stayed at moonlight rock which was very basic but I liked it. I have been to Cambodia only once.  I fell in love!  I cannot wait to return after reading your blog.  I want to spend a lot more time exploring that beautiful country and their people! I feel the same way and can’t wait to return. Thanks for this! Yep! Great post! Inclined to agree with you Cambodia being the ‘land of smiles’, although Thailand too has plentiful smiles. If you’re ever back in Cambodia then you should give a shot, a truly off the beaten path experience in Siem Reap  Kristin, your viewpoint is always refreshing. Thanks for sharing. I’ve been to Cambodia twice, the first time in 2012 for 3 days as it was a side trip from Thailand and actually took the train from Bangkok to the border , crossed the border on foot and a bus to Siem Reap. I loved it so much i went back a year later and did a few days in Phnom Penh and another 7 days in Siem Reap. Anyone who hasnt gone to Cambodia yet you should go. I never met so many smiling happy people and while the traffic can be chaos, its fun chaos. Siem Reap, the markets, the food, the temples, Tonle Sap is a place that will stick with me forever and its just an unbelievable place. I cant wait to get back there Same here. Sounds like we were there right at the same time and I wonder how it is now, almost 4 years later! Hey! Love your blog, very helpful to help me plan!Tell me, what time of year did you travel there? Thanks 🙂 October but any time is great.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/biking-around-kratie-feeling-like-a-celebrity/,Biking Around Kratie Feeling Like a Celebrity,Cambodia,"Day 27 I arrived in Kratie, Cambodia last night after a 9-hour bus ride from Phnom Penh, a brief stopover after my night on Rabbit Island.  The past few days have been a whirlwind of travel and I’m so tired of moving this quickly. I only came to Kratie on a whim.  I heard it was cool, so I hopped on the next bus over. A fellow guest-house patron and I decide to hire bicycles and ride around the Mekong, through Kratie and to the smaller towns along the river.  I really enjoyed the last time I rode bikes in Cambodia, so I have a feeling this will work out well. We start down the road to the ferry and immediately the town fades away and a dirt road appears, surrounded by jungle-like flora, cows, and residences. Kids run out of the wooden shacks on stilts and yell “hello!” in the cheeriest, brightest fashion. They don’t just say it once either, they keep yelling it and waving enthusiastically.  I feel the need to respond to each and every one.  Sometimes practically singing “hellooo!” when a big group of them rides by. I feel a little bit like a celebrity on the smallest scale possible.  Here I am, riding a rickety little bike with a tilting seat, wearing a Chang beer tank top (Khao San road’s finest), sweating like a pig, and yet I’m the entertainment of the day. Kiddies, I’m sorry. I didn’t know I’d have an audience. I should have put on my Sunday best. My biking companion is a 30 year old guy from Melbourne who took a short career break/dental vacation to Bangkok.  He has a girlfriend back home and I’m happy that we’re able to just bike along as nothing other than friends.  He’s a great companion and I enjoy his platonic company. He enjoys saying hi to the children, too. It’s really nice to see them just enjoying life and going to school.  So far in Cambodia, I’ve seen tons of children peddling bracelets or books on the street and in Angkor Wat.  It’s a tough thing to see children as young as 5 working. Today, however, these kids appear to just be kids. We end up on some pretty remote little roads several miles outside of Kratie, loving the countryside and completely oblivious to the fact that we’re headed farther and farther into the boonies. He shouts to me, “By the way, I’m not the best with directions!” To which I respond, “Perfect! I have no sense of direction at all!” We pass a few waving men but figure they’re saying hello as well, so we simply wave and keep going.  Eventually, as the rain starts to come down softly, we decide to stop when yet another adult waves. We learned a valuable lesson that day: when a kid in Kratie yells out to you, wave.  When adult yells out to you, stop and find out what the heck you’re doing wrong. He points us in the right direction and we’re on our way back to the river, where we meant to be all along. A couple of times, my pesky bike seat tilts so much that I need a helping hand.  Luckily, both times I stop at a random shack that appears to hold promise of a possible wrench, I’m helped by an eager and friendly local who expects nothing in return.  Both times, surrounded by kids saying “hello” over and over. The rain never lets up but it’s welcome.  It provides relief on an otherwise sweltering hot day. We spend the better part of the day biking around the mighty Mekong, and a subdued evening with a couple of other travelers in a very quiet Kratie (the king has died and Cambodia is finishing up a week of silence in his honor). My next AM will probably involve sore muscles and loads of Tiger Balm.  But I’ll worry about that tomorrow.  Today, I’m still in the afterglow of a beautiful day in the countryside – something I’ve been craving since I got to Cambodia.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tips-from-the-banker-what-it-really-costs-to-travel-in-laos/,Tips from the Banker: What it Really Costs to Travel in Laos,Laos,"Keeping with the same logic that applied to the costs in Cambodia post, I wondered if I could continue traveling on the cheap while in Laos.  The answer was yes – the real cost of travel in Laos can be as low as $30/day.  In the three weeks I spent there, I ended up spending right around USD$750. Activities can break the bank in Laos, with the Gibbon Experience and other zip lining tours costing a couple hundred dollars (but I didn’t do any of those.  Been zip lining, it’s cool, but I don’t need to pay USD$270 to do it again). My final verdict is that transportation is considerably more expensive in Laos, while accommodation, food, and activities run at about the same rate as Cambodia. If staying in dorms or sharing a room, it’s pretty easy to get by spending around $4-$6 in most places. Keep in mind that facilities tend to be very basic especially if you are staying in a locally-run hostel. Mattresses tend to be thin, and a hot shower is never guaranteed (though with Laos’s temperature, an ice cold shower may not sound bad at all). Most hostels do not have a kitchen that you can use, but many offer complimentary breakfast. The electricity might go out every now and then but some more established hostels have their own generator. I find the hostel staff in Laos a bit shy but incredibly sweet. Overall, expect little and just be happy with a clean bed to sleep on at night! If you are traveling in the low season, it is possible to walk into a local guesthouse and score a private room for $3 a night. The cheapest place I have stayed in during the whole of my travels was in Laos, with my share costing only $1.25 for a shared bungalow and bathroom (though it was a squat toilet, everyone’s favorite) Hostels in Luang Prabang: $4-$8 (click to book your hostels in Luang Prabang here) Hostels in Vang Vieng: $4-$6 (click to book your hostels in Vang Vieng here) Hostels in Vientiane: $4-$10 (click to book your hostels in Vientiane here) Hostels in Pakse: $8-$12 (click to book your hostels in Pakse here)  Transportation is, unfortunately, neither cheap nor convenient in Laos.  It is a very mountainous country with poor roads, so it takes a long time to get from point A to point B, even if the distance, km-wise, seems short.  Local buses are cheaper but take a notoriously long time due to frequent and long stops (a buddy of mine got stuck on one for 12 hours to go a distance of only 100km), while night-time VIP busses can cost upwards of $20.  Book directly at the bus depot to save a few dollars. I never saw a taxi here, so tuk-tuks and moto taxis are the best mode of transport.  As always, haggle the price down.  The starting figure should never be the ending figure. Tangent: My favorite was a quote from my buddy Michael when negotiating a tuk-tuk fare down from 30,000 kip to 20,000.  “Wait,” he said “are we arguing over a dollar here?” to which I said “Yes, but it’s the principle, Michael, the principle.” Local food tend to be cheap and basic at about $1-$3. Get ready to eat a lot of fried rice and sticky rice. Western food can be found for anywhere from $2-$6 for a standard meal. Breakfast is available at any time of the day.  Street food is readily available if you make your way to the night markets.  In Luang Prabang, for example, there was a vegetarian buffet for 10,000 kip, and with meat, the price was only 20,000 kip ($1.25-$2.50). Smaller towns are markedly cheaper in Laos.  In Tat Lo, on the Bolaven Plateau loop, I only spent $1.25 for my half of the bungalow we stayed in.  It was basic, made of nailed together boards of wood and housed only a mattress and a mosquito net, but what more do you really need?  I also found Vang Vieng to be cheap, as I stayed at another modest bungalow on the river for only 30,000 kip ($3.75) per night. The single most expensive town was Luang Prabang.  While food was cheap, accommodation was not. I had three massages with Tiger Balm three days in a row while in Vang Vieng, each lasting an hour and only costing around $6.  It was amazing, felt great, and left my skin tingling.  Lao massages are AWESOME. Sim cards for smartphones that utilize 3G are cheap and easy to get in Laos. I spent around $5 for unlimited internet each week (although there were plenty of places I stayed in that had no power for most of the day or were out of range). *I didn’t get to visit as many towns in Laos as I did in Cambodia, due to the bad roads and my tendency to stay places longer.  There is still much of the north I have yet to see/evaluate price-wise.  That’ll be another trip! A $6 massage?! Sign. Me. Up. Right?! That’s why I went three days in a row! gosh so much adventure! You are lucky.  xo cassy http://theworkette.blogspot.com/ I am 🙂 Love the piece! Tiger Balm massages, wowww! They are so amazing. Hey, great post! found it very useful as I will be heading up to laos at the end of the month for about ten days. Been spending the last three months in Chiang Mai/traveling all over Thailand. Heading to Malaysia after that.  Thanks for the tips! Laos was one of favorites… have been planning for a while now. Thanks for the tips in post. Most to make it there sometime. I love love loved Laos I really enjoy reading all your posts about traveling and I don’t have to be there but I call feel it. Why I can  feel it? because I am excited just to read your posts and seating here this late with smiling on my face knowing that you guys have a great time and have been all over Southeast Asia.  I just feel relax after reading your posts.All the beautiful photos and many places you have gone through I really appreciated. I hope someday I can do that too. 🙂By the way I was born in Laos I think I am too old to travel like you guys. Who knows right? I always think that life is too short to stay in one place. That’s awesome. Thanks so much for the kind words. You’re never too old to travel! I love your blog! You provide so much useful information! I’m going to SE Asia in November. Would you recommend Luang Prabang over Vientianne, or vice versa? That’s tough but if I had to pick one I’d say Luang Prabang has a lot more things to do! Thank you so much for recommending Luang Prabang. I went last month and had the most amazing time there! 🙂 I want to travel to Vietnam and Cambodia, what do you think about Laos? is it necessary  visit there or you think Laos same as Cambodia and Vietnam?! Definitely not the same. I loved Laos.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-laos/,The Best Things to Do in Laos,Laos,"“Sa Bai Dee!” This Laotian greeting still echoes in my ears every now and then. Laos is a special place in my heart – it is where I cruised down a beautiful river on a tube, where I fell in love, and where I realized how much I’ve changed in 5 years as a traveler. I loved the dramatic mountains, the lush jungles, the friendly people, and the laid back vibe. I figured it’s time for me to put together an epic itinerary for you with the best things to do in Laos, starting from the south to the north (which is what I did, but it can be easily reversed!):  When you first enter Laos, you’ll quickly realize that everything slows down. Time seems to have lost its meaning there, and it is especially apparent in Don Det, a hippie heaven just north of the Cambodian border. Southern Laos receives far fewer travelers than its fast growing Northern side, and most travelers here are found lazing in a hammock outside of modest bungalows built by the river, soaking in silence. It’s the perfect start to your Laos journey! Some may say that there’s not much to do in Don Det, but that’s not true. You can go for kayaking trips that take off daily in the morning, rent a bicycle and get lost in the villages, head to Don Khong to check out the waterfalls, and of course, tube your way down the Mekong River with new friends you’ve just met. It is also home to the stunning Li Phi Waterfalls! I loved Don Det, in fact I’d say that it was my favorite place in Laos. From Don Det, take a 3-hour bus to Pakse, the biggest southern city and a major transport hub in Laos. You are likely to arrive in Pakse in the afternoon, so it’s best to spend the rest of the day relaxing, sorting out a motorbike rental, and getting ready for an incredible adventure in the Bolaven Plateau.  If you are looking some some off the beaten path adventures in Laos, consider doing the multi-day motorcycle loop around the Bolaven Plateau. The scenery blew me away with lush and beautiful plants, giant butterflies, and ample waterfalls (I saw a total of 5 but there were so many more!). It’s best done in a group, but it is also completely possible to do it solo, as long as you are confident and comfortable on a motorbike. Also just on the outskirts of Pakse, Wat Phu is an impressive Khmer temple that reminds me of a miniature version of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, though it was actually built in the 7th century, way before Angkor Wat. Wat Phu does not see as many tourists, though, so it’s a nice change of atmosphere. This will make a nice day trip from Pakse, just make sure to pile on sunscreen as there’s very little shade! The capital of Laos is surprisingly quiet and laid-back. There’s honestly not a ton to do in Vientiane, though if you’re heading to Thailand after and want to spend more than 30 days there, it’s the perfect place to sort out your 60-day visa. There are a few temples worth checking out, such as the golden Pha That Luang, and the Wat Si Saket. There’s also a mural in a hostel there painted by yours truly. Check it out!  Tranquility is back in Vang Vieng, now that rules and regulations are imposed on the once deadly (no kidding, as more than 20 people died from drowning, jumping into shallow waters, and drug overdose every year) tubing that was notoriously popular among backpackers. There are now more group travelers, which has resulted in bigger hotels and restaurants. What this all means is that the river is now less occupied, and the rural, off-beat places that group tours never go are available for discovery. Here are a few things to do when you are here: It is a unique way to spend your day, and you can still take beer along with you while taking in the scenery as you float. Rent a tube, grab a beer, go alone or with a few people, and let the river take you from the top of the river to town. If you want to make it active, consider kayaking instead of tubing. There are still a few stops along the way, including a popular Irish bar. If you want to avoid the crowds, consider going in the early morning. The weather would be much more forgiving, too. Leave all of your valuable belongings behind, or bring a dry bag with you. I’d bring just a GoPro and some loose change! Vang Vieng is a great place to rock climb, whether you are a first-timer or an experienced climber. This area and others around it are getting more and more popular with the climbing community. Rent a motorbike or a bicycle and get out of town. You will be surrounded by lush greens, beautiful rice paddy fields, and quiet villages within minutes. Check out the Tham Phu Kham Cave and Blue Lagoon on your journey. Both are gorgeous! From Vang Vieng, take a bus to Luang Prabang, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is a highlight of Laos for many travelers, and a lot of people end up staying longer than intended, so leave room for serendipity: An icon just outside the city, Kuang Si Waterfalls are stunning and SO worth seeing it in person (the water really is that blue!). If you are fairly confident and comfortable on a motorbike, you could rent one and get there on your own. Minivans and Tuk-Tuks are also available to take you there. From the entrance, it is a small hike up to the waterfalls that will take you past rescued black bears hanging out at the sanctuary. It will only be a few minutes before you start hearing the water. The area is packed with tourists for most of the day, so consider going early in the morning and try to be the first person in if you want to avoid the crowds. To get a panoramic view of the waterfalls from high up, continue your hike to the (not so) secret waterfalls. While the strict 11pm curfew is imposed on all businesses (everything shuts down at 11:30pm), curiously, a bowling alley is open all night. It’s where everyone goes when everything else shuts down for the night. The bowling alley is a fun place to hang out and meet fellow travelers if you’re feeling the party vibe. This is Pousibily (see what I did there?!) the best spot in Luang Prabang for sunset. It’s a leisure hike up with a temple on the top of the mountain. While you will have to share the spot with others, the 360 degree view of Luang Prabang and the beautiful Mekong River is worth the squeeze. Take a 4-hour bus ride from Luang Prabang to Nong Khiaw, a small town with quite literally nothing to do. It is a quiet, laid back village that’s perfect for relaxing. In low season, a spacious bungalow next to the river could cost as low as $3. You can also take a 3-4 hour walk to one of the 3 smaller villages close by and spend a night at a local homestay, and experience the true Laotian village life. This could be a nice ending to your Laos journey, before taking a 2-day boat to northern Thailand (or if you are coming from Thailand using this method, Huay Xai will be your very first stop in Laos!). A popular activity to do in Huay Xai is The Gibbon Experience, where you get to spend a few days zip-lining in the jungle, with an opportunity to stay in a treehouse and witnessing the gibbons in their natural habitat. To be honest I didn’t try it, but everyone I met who did gave it rave reviews. It is a wonderful way to spend some time with nature and contribute to forest preservation at the same time. I hope these tips helped you to plan a Laos itinerary with some of the well-loved spots, and a few under the radar ones.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/get-sim-cards-southeast-asia/,How to Get SIM Cards in Southeast Asia,Laos,"In a comment on a recent post, I was asked to write about traveling with an unlocked iPhone (or any smart phone, really), obtaining SIM cards abroad, and how the whole process takes place. Kellie, I’m glad you asked. I have been traveling for over 5 years now with an unlocked iPhone, always buying a prepaid SIM in the local country I happen to be traveling in. Why buy a local Sim? I have found in Southeast Asia that this is particularly helpful because the Wifi is often weak, but the 3G is usually quite strong.  It’s also great to be able to make calls when needed and to always be able to use the google maps function.  It gives me peace of mind. Why buy an unlocked phone? I had originally obtained my phone with a contract with AT&T back in the United States.  As anyone who has tried to unlock a phone knows, one can only do this by calling the provider after the 2-year contract is up.  We won’t even address traveling with a SIM from back home, because that is prohibitively expensive.  If your contract is not yet up then your options are somewhat limited.  You can, A: Call your provider and ask them to put you on a disabled plan. This was allowed with AT&T for 6 months at $10 month, which finished out my contract.  It’s not ideal, but it’s better than the $75/month I was previously paying.  The phone will still be locked, but you can use it with wifi only, which is still useful.  You can then buy a cheap local phone with a local SIM B: Put your phone on a disabled plan and use a shady 3rd party website to unlock it. Honestly, I went with this plan, though I won’t link the website I used here (but you can contact me if you really want the details) and I probably should not have just admitted that, as it goes against the contract and one can be fined for doing so SIM card availability for smart phones Generally, I find that many countries in Southeast Asia are now catching up and the iPhones are more and more available, meaning micro and nano SIM cards are as well.  That said, there have been plenty of times when the person at the stall handed me a standard SIM along with a pair of scissors as well.  Sometimes they have a SIM cutter and sometimes they don’t. In the cases that they don’t I just remove my current SIM, match up the edges, and cut.  It does’t have to be perfect, it just has to generally fit (and make sure you’re only cutting the plastic part). How to find a SIM card There are a few ways to find a SIM and it depends on the country. In Thailand, they can be easily purchased at 7-11. I personally use DTAC, and I buy it directly at the DTAC store. They tend to have locations in big cities such as Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Bangkok. 4G is widely available, and data plan runs at about 100 baht for 1GB worth of data valid for a week. One must also buy the SIM itself for around 50 baht, if memory serves.  There were no language barrier issues. in Cambodia, Metfone is the most popular network, and you can find the flagship stores in major cities. 1.5GB worth of data valid for a week costs just $1.5. There are no 7-11s in Cambodia, but SIMs can be bought at smaller cell stands as well.  There were no language barrier issues in Siem Reap. In Laos, it was a little less straightforward.  I paid around $10 for a SIM and found that the data ran out fairly quickly. I never found a cell store there and just bought from a nondescript stand. I wish I could be more helpful here, but I was pretty disconnected in Laos and didn’t worry too much about it. In Malaysia, it is not as cheap to stay connected. There are a few good companies and you really can’t go wrong. Most malls there sell the SIMs which include data and some calling and texts.  Since most Malaysians speak English quite well you shouldn’t have much issue getting a SIM. With the country’s largest network, Maxis, 1GB worth of data valid for a week costs about $2.5. Indonesia still baffles me a bit.  In Medan, I bought a SIM with the 3 network for only $3, and the 3G never ran out over the 6 weeks that I lived there.  I still don’t understand why because the man I bought it from spoke no English and at the time I spoke almost zero Bahasa.  However, it only worked in major cities.  Simpati was the best bet for the islands, such as Lombok and Bali, but I had to reload it constantly. I found that small amounts ran out very quickly, but as soon as I put USD$10 on there, it lasted for a while. There’s also usually a service fee to reload, so might as well do it infrequently.  This can all be handled at cell phone stands and convenience stores. With all of the SIM purchasing scenarios, make sure the 3G is fully functioning before walking out of the store or away from the stand. It’s often not as straightforward as just popping in the SIM and you may need some additional help setting up the network. There you have it.  The ins and outs of buying a SIM are actually pretty straightforward, but just take a little bit of know how in some countries prior to purchasing.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the comments section. This was super helpful! I never have a phone when I travel (I just use mine for WiFi) and I really don’t know why. It’s so cheap and so convenient in tons of places. It IS nice to feel disconnected…but Google Maps is also great. Always a trade-off! I do enjoy being off the grid from time to time too! For Malaysia I used Tune Talk, the SIM card which I purchased along with my Air Asia ticket (although you can purchase it upon arrival) and picked up at the airport. The staff where very helpful and set up my phone so I didn’t have to do anything! It cost me about $30 per month if I remember correctly 🙂 For Indonesia I can’t remember exactly what SIM I used (I’m thinking something called eXcel), but I remember I paid for it and then the lady at the shop couldn’t get it to work on my phone (HTC smartphone). I went back to my room and Googled it, and sure enough – there were instructions on how to change the settings to make it work. I think I put about $20 on for the month I was there. It worked on the Gillis and on Lombok.  For any Australian readers – it SHOULD be free to get your phone unlocked. Just contact your service provider, put your plan on hold (they usually do this for free for up to 3 months, though any insurance you pay on top of it, you still need to pay). For Vodafone, you should be able to unlock your phone online. IMPORTANT – make sure you do this before you leave Australia as you need to input some codes into your phone. Thanks for the additional info! I had no idea about Tune Talk or that Aussie phones can be unlocked while under contract. Awesome! Thank you so much, Kristin! This is just what I needed. Like you said, it’s a painful outlay at first so I’ve been holding off. The camera is important to me so I’m probably going to get the new 5S but I’m still figuring out which country to buy from. I feel like I’m slowly getting closer though and I’ll be coming back to this very useful post to put your tips into practice. You’re a star. Glad to help! For Travelers to Viet Nam,It is easy to buy a cheap cellphone such as Nokia, SamSung,LG,… with the price only 20- 30 USD. You can find the Phone Shop easily a long streets in the towns with signs of Nokia, IPhone, Samsung,…The micro Sim card for iphone also is sale very popular in these shops and they even can cut your normal Sim card to make it fix to your Iphone (the fee could be 1 USD or if you buy the cellphone from them they will do it for free).If you want to have more information, i am always ready to help.Thao Phan Thanks for the info! I haven’t yet been to Vietnam so that was definitely missing from this post! Hello, I will go to 4000 islands (Don Det) in South Laos, can I use my DTAC Thai SIM card there ? It’s close to the border. Nope 🙁 once you cross borders they stop working I’m back. Right, it’s not working. Bought a Laos SIM card for 2$. Hi Kristin, Just found your site while looking up suggestions for Simcards in Cambodia. We’ve been using our unlocked iphone4s and had the exact same scenario as you mentioned come up while in Bali; the amount of money coming off our cheap sim there didn’t seem to make sense! I’m glad I came across your site now as we are heading over to Vietnam in a week and I see you were just there! Awesome! Hope my suggestions help :). SIMs there are super cheap! They certainly did! I liked it so much, I even had to write a quick post about it Thank you. I finally got an iPhone 5s with an unlocked sim card. In Japan I never found one, but it is good to hear I could get one in other Asian countries. I do agree it is sort of fun to be off the grid, I used my iPad and email a lot when i travel. In the Philippines, it is also very easy and cheap to buy sim cards! I think around 50 Pesos, and you can top up your load. Texting is most common there and calling is more expensive. I don’t know about 3G, I did not really need it because many places have WiFi. I wanted it more for 3G and found one company very expensive and one was just fine. I think the cheaper one was World something. Multiple misinformations to me from Smart Internet and their agents resulted in pretty much my entire day wasted and still no decent internet connection. The worst of it was that much of their misinformation to me seemed to me to be quite deliberate and extremely blameworthy. Hi Kristin – Thanks for the helpful info, here and all over your site! I’m planning a year long trip to Australia (6-8 months), SE Asia (about 2 months) and Europe (2-4 months). I plan on disabling my Verizon account and using a site to unlock my iphone 5. Do you have a suggestion for getting a SIM card in Australia? Do you think this system will also work in Europe? Thank you 🙂 I always get SIMs everywhere I go, even now in Eastern Africa! I can’t recall who I used in Australia, honestly. Just ask the locals for the best company when you arrive, which is what I usually do. I have Samsung Note 3, a 4G LTE smartphone.VZW confirmed that all its 4G LTE smartphones are unlocked.  We confirmed that with different phones 2 Note 3 and 1 iPhone 5, with micro SIM purchased over many countries: Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Vietnam, and Italy.  With the exception in Vietnam where we used a local network, we used Vodafone micro SIM’s in all remaining countries.  We’re traveling to Thailand,  Indonesia,  Singapore, and Malaysia in August 2015, and we’re confident we’ll have no troubles using local micro SIM’s. Thank you for the details of different networks available in these countries, as well as their cost. There’s always a pair of scissors around to make a SIM fit as well. Hey Kristin, I’m wondering if you ever considered using T Mobile since they seem to have a pretty good deal with international travel.  Unlimited data and texting, .20 a minute to talk.  They are charging $60 a month for that, but does it make more sense to use local SIM cards?  Is there better service using local SIM cards? I have definitely considered it, but it’s almost universally more expensive than the SIM cards in the countries I’m traveling to. For example I paid $4 in Vietnam per Gigabyte of data. Greetings from Fiji. I am anindigenous. Hope you cover the south pacific…. There are thousands of islands to cover ? Whose beaches, Reefs and rainforest  will stop your heart.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chillest-places-asia/,The 8 Chillest Places in Asia,Laos,"When you imagine the most peaceful place you’ve ever been, what comes to mind? I’ve been to places where, whether it’s because of a hippie vibe, a genuine feeling of peace, or just the amazing people around me (usually all three), it just feels chill, and I feel like I could stay there forever. I came to realize over time that these are the places I like the most. They’re usually small communities, very focused on the preservation and appreciation of nature, and the general feeling is one of calm. Here are the best of what I’ve discovered so far: Even the name, Ella, sounds all magical and beautiful. In Ella, plenty of bars and restaurants have lounge lofts with bean bags, coffee stops, and your typical corner roti man serving up meals for under a dollar. The train ride to or from this beautiful town is breathtaking as well (get the spot in the doorway!). Ella itself is full of waterfalls, wonderful hiking, and is bordered by tea plantations on both sides. I’ve said it before and will say it again: it’s some sort of unspoken rule that anywhere with tea plantations will and must be beautiful. Yubeng is located in the far west of China, right up against Tibet in Yunnan province. It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a sacred area and all along the trail to Yubeng prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it. I talk about Pai all the time. In life, in this blog, in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day. I could visit the Land Split, swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon. The thought has often crossed my mind to take up a longer term residence there at some point. Speaking of hippie paradises, Otres Beach in Cambodia might be the winner, at least when I was there a little over two years ago. Most visitors who spend a while there have the same routine: wake up, swim, have some muesli and green tea, buy a mixed bag of small and sweet banana, mango and pineapple from the fruit lady, have a few Anchor beers, swim, consider BBQ or a bonfire, rinse, repeat. Why not? It’s paradise incarnate with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water. Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared. It’s easy to laze away in Don Det, reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world. I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali. Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street. Dali is relaxed, it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it. Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous. Discovered by accident when I was entranced by the look of Tonsai on my way to Railay (I asked the boat man to take me back to Tonsai once I’d seen it, please and thank you), I’ve returned and just love the chill vibe and beautiful surroundings. Tonsai is also an active place, full of kayakers, divers, rock climbers, fire dancers ,and slack-line walkers. It’s the perfect place to pick up a new skill, or to just laze around by the beach and read books. This was my favorite part of Vietnam because the locals flashed peace signs at me as I rode by on my motorbike, families watched fascinated and waved from their porches, and and old lady sat on my bike with me, stroked my face, and then rested for a while as we just sat there in relaxed silence. It was all quite strange and amazing. There’s really only one road through the town and not a whole lot of noise or business around. This makes for a really peaceful, agricultural, and naturally beautiful place. I definitely felt calm and in my natural element while at Phong Nha. — Those are my personal favorites, but there are an infinite number of chill places to find, no doubt, and what is chill is usually a bit undiscovered, so the chillness level does change often. Regardless, when I look back on my travels, these are the places I tended to enjoy the most and to find the most like-minded people. Coincidentally they are all naturally beautiful. What would you add to the list? I’m always on the hunt for the next peaceful, quiet, mellow destination.   Hi Kristin,First thanks for the list: after 7 years, I will be back in Southeast Asia in a few days for 4 months, and 2 of the places you list are actually on my list (never been there before): Phong Nha Ke Bang & Otres Beach. I was actually scared Otres Beach would be awfully touristy!In a completely different way, the last place I found really relaxing and inviting to slow down in Asia was Turtuk, in the Nubra Valley in Ladakh.CheersGilles It’s possible it has become more touristy since I was last there – in fact I’m sure it is. If you really want something more remote you can head to Rabbit island off of Kep in Cambodia. They didn’t actually have running water or even electricity when I was last there, so I’m guessing things may have upgraded slightly since then. Would love to hear your thoughts after you go to Otres! Thanks Kristin!I will let you know and of course write about it.I am concerned about the masses especially since I will be there over Xmas.CheersGilles Please add the name of each country. The name of each country is listed right next to the name of the city. Ella is in Sri Lanka, Pai is in Thailand, etc. Hoi An is very pretty. I’ve heard great things about Khao Sok! Otres Beach was definitely a highlight of my Asia trip. I met some awesome people there and we enjoyed low key days on the beautiful beach and then BBQ and (50 cent) beers after the sun set. Perfect. I also really liked Don Det and Pai so it seems like we have similar tastes. I’ll have to check out the rest the next time I’m in Asia. I think the beach BBQ I had on Otres was the best I’ve ever had. The meat was so good and we ate it all with our hands. I just love eating with my hands, to be perfectly honest. I would also add Chitwan in Nepal and also Battambang in Cambodia. Unbelievable laid back and peaceful for a small city! Thanks! I should check those out as I haven’t been to either one. “It just feels chill” – Ok, you couldn’t have said it better. Great suggestions and i love the photos (hanging out in Pai is my favourite). Haha, it’s a feeling, you know? Awesome! If you hit any of these I think you’ll be pleased with the vibes. These place are all really nice, but if you reaaaally want to chill out I’d say head to Central Asia! Like Khorog in Tajikistan, or Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. So laid back! So many people have suggested that lately and I’ve heard great things. They’re on the list now. Aahhh I am ALL about the chill places! Def adding these to my list for my RTW next year. Thank you! 🙂 Nothing better than a great chill place! It’s now my mission to visit as many of these places as I can on my trip to Asia next year. Thanks for sharing them! That’s awesome! Let me know how it goes please! Dali is the only place I really want to visit in China…met a couple who owns a hotel there and it just sounds magical There are so many other amazing places in China worth visiting as well, especially around Dali. Let me know if you ever make it out there! Khao Sok in Thailand was incredible.. I had to return a few months later! I will go back as well. I agree with Don det, so relaxed. Great post, gives me some ideas for the future Thanks for letting me know about Khao Sok. I want to check it out! Hi you should try Easter island its Amazing i sat at the higest point on the island, then it hit me there is No one higher than me for 3500km wow .. That’s very cool! Her Kristin,This is a real cool post. I liked it so much I reposted on my blogs facebook page 🙂 I thought I would have been to more but have only been to 3 places on this list! I think Tonsai Beach was my favourite chillest place thus far! A couple of cool chill places in India would be McLeod Ganj (gorgeous tibetan town in the foot of the Himalayas), Palolem Beach in Goa ($3 private beachfront cananas – yes please!) and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (go and stay in a castle for a few days eating amazing foods while watching the sun set from the roof of the castle). Have you been to any of these? Awesome, thank you! Thanks so much for giving me India tips! I am really looking forward to the time when I take off for an extended trip through there. Yes, Ella does sound very pretty and serene… And Pai? We’ve not heard of that before in Thailand. Another chill spot is Gili Air (one of the Gili islands off Lombok, Indonesia) – but don’t go to neighboring Gili T if you’re looking for “chill” as that’s quite a party island! We loved Koh Lanta in Thailand – found it very restful. But we hear a bridge is being built to connect it to Krabi, so rumour has it that the island may not stay so peaceful for long… I went to Gili T for a week right at the end of my first 10 months in SEA and have to say I really enjoyed it! I know it’s a party place but better for a solo traveler. I think Gili Air would have been awesome with a partner but my friend came back and said solo it was a little depressing.  You haven’t heard of Pai?! I’m obsessed with Pai! Go forth and visit! Thanks Kristin for exploring some best places of Asia through this post. Thanks for reading 🙂 Great post! I would love to check out Don Det, Laos. It seems like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. You’re website is pretty amazing. Hope my blog can be half as good as yours one day. That’s really kind of you, David! I would say you could be right assuming Don Det is like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. It’s still its own thing and its own place but both are worth checking out. Both are beautiful. Hi Kristin,I am headed to Southeast Asia in a few months but will only be able to stay for a little over a month. I am starting in Thailand and ending in Bali with a final night in Singapore. I am hoping to be efficient and get to see parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia as well. Any suggestions on how to make the most of your time while backpacking and ensure you get to see everything on your list? (Not your list specifically, just a list in general :-)) Any advice would be awesome!Thanks,Jordan You’re a bit limited with that timeframe and I’m sure you don’t want to burn yourself out with rapid movement, so I’d suggest seeing Angkor Wat in Cambodia, checking out an island such as Perhentian or Tioman in Malaysia, and exploring Hanoi and the surrounding areas in Vietnam, as those were the highlights for me and I bet you’d be pretty happy with those spots. So glad to hear it’s still good because I would like to return in May 🙂 Gah! I miss Pai so much and it was by far my favorite place in Thailand to visit. The hammocks, the sunsets, the night market, and the freakin’ food! I never made it to Tonsai but I’ll have to hit that next time I’m in Thailand. I feel like we are very alike in places we love to chill, so when I do finally get to Sri Lanka and China and the like, I’ll make it a point to check these out! we probably do have similar taste! Pai is always a wonderful place to be. I love your posts! And since I read the articles about Pai I just want to go there like immediately 🙂 in 2 weeks it is gonna be so far 🙂 Could you please share, where I can find this chill terrace from your Pai picture?  Wish you lots of fun on your further trips!! Thanks Maria! The photo is at the Container. OTRES BEACH brings back some serious ‘chill’ memories. Its amazing how its right down then way from the ‘main’ beach but its literally deserted.   Great choice! Glad to hear it’s still like that because I plan to return after 2.5 years away in May! Hi Kristin!I really enjoy your post, I ran into your blog for I will embark on my first solo trip in a couple months. I’ll be heading to Pai and I just love the picture you posted for Pai. Do you mind telling me the place. The one with the beautiful scenery and hanging chairs. Thanks It’s called the Container 🙂 HelloWhere in Pai is the photo with the swinging chairs taken? I’d love to go!K It’s called the Container, near Coffee in Love Hi, I will be travelling to southeast Asia in a couple weeks. Where are the hanging egg shaped seats in Pai? Thanks The Container Hello, is a great article. I hope sometimes i will visit Asia because is such a great place and i like their food Always wanted to visit Asia. And your post makes me want to make it happen more. Thank you! c”,) Indeed, Pai and the Land Split, are quite the Chill places! The snacks and beverages on those hammocks had me feeling like I was just floating on a cloud. I can still taste that yummy tamarind…mmmMMM. Hi Kristin! I’ll be back to Asia next year, and this is absolutely gold to include in my plans, thank you! I know you focus mainly in Southeast Asia, but if you ever decide to change destination, you could try Costa Rica 🙂 Puerto Viejo and Montezuma, even if are touristic places, have that chill vibe that make you question if you should leave everything to just live there! Thanks for the great post! I went through Costa Rica once for a week when I was in my early 20s and hit Belize the year after that for the same length of time. I’d love to move slowly through Central America the way I did through Southeast Asia. I’ve heard it’s a great place for slow travel as well Great post and I agree with otres being the best! I lived there for a while but do make sure you choose otres 2 not 1. kampot (a couple of hours) away is also amazing! Found some new gems from this for the next travels though. Great article.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/10-quirky-things-to-love-about-laos/,10 Quirky Things to Love About Laos,Laos,"1) Sai ba dee! Everyone, from random ladies passing by, to little children, to monks walking down the street in their bright orange regalia, call out this beautiful hello. 2) Awkward table and chair heights Maybe it’s because I’m lanky, but I never did find a table nor chair that was tall enough or quite the right match to fit my legs under. It seemed there was never more than an inch or two between the chair seat and table, so I spent a lot of my time in Laos much like the hunchback of Notre Dame. 3) Live Engrish singers Walking around the Mekong in Vientiane, I overheard a woman with a truly incredible voice singing songs by Adele, Lady Gaga, and Leona Lewis, hitting every pitch.  I came closer, but there was a little something off.  The chorus words were mostly right, but the rest of the words were mumbled. It was just about the cutest thing I’d ever heard. 4) Bars close at 11pm, clubs close at 3am, but bowling in Luang Prabang, complete with $2 rum, keeps rocking until 5am. I’m not sure why.  I don’t really get it.  It’s best not to question such things. 5) “5 minutes” When people say things operate on Lao time, I totally get it now.  Booking a ticket can easily take two hours, you will find shop owners asleep rather than heckling you from the street to buy their wares. Laos is extremely laid back, and taught me a little bit about patience. 6) Chilies drying in the sun Saw these everywhere. Accidentally ate one once.  I have just one thing to say about that: FREAKING OUCH. 7) Bad hair cuts I stopped into a shop, feeling the crispy ends of my hair after getting entirely too wind-whipped motorbiking the Bolaven Plateau.  I showed the girl with my fingers how much to cut off, and watched in horror as she gave me a super blunt cut, moving directly from right to left, unable to communicate that I wanted Megan Fox-esque layers. Letting this one grow out.  Dear 6 pound 7 ounce baby Jesus, please let this grow out quickly! 8) Sleeper Busses you’ll never fit into Also? you’ll be spooning your neighbor over the bumpiest roads in all of Southeast Asia. 9) Che, hammer and chisel – Laos is communist and proud. Many tourists jumped on board and bought the shirts as well.  I might just get shanked if I wore that in the states! 10) Baguettes here, there, everywhere! Blame the French influence – I couldn’t get away from the carb overload! On a serious note, Laos was one of the most breathtakingly beautiful countries I’ve been to.  My three weeks there were magical.  If you’re even remotely considering visiting, I’m telling you to GO, go for sure.  It’s a spectacular place with spectacular people. Have you been to Laos? Did I miss any quirky things to love (other than delish beer Lao?)   miss that place so much! I need to get back there and experience the 5am bowling! I miss it too! Missed it the second I left. Agree on the beauty… amazingness! Never took a sleeper bus in Laos, but took them in Vietnam. Wondering how they compare. Vietnam was also very bumpy and had craaaaazy drivers. I took one in Vietnam and thought it was pretty good.  I had my own space and actually fit in the bed. I was impressed! You mean 11pm? Yeah most things have to close, but bowling, inexplicably, is allowed to remain open. Nice post. Laos is next on the list for me, and I’m a bit worried about the table/chair thing (I’m 6′ 2″). Am less concerned about the lack of availability of Megan Fox layers in the salon tho’… Haha, I was traveling with a 6’2 guy for a little while and, while it’s not going to be pleasant if you ever take a sleeper bus, or forget to duck, you’ll be mostly alright 🙂 LAO PDR literally means Lao People Don’t Rush lol. Love that country and hope to travel back again.Great blog and tips btw 🙂 Hahaha so true! Next year i will also  visit laos !  How many days would be enough for luang prabang? İ have planned only 3 days . İs it enaough? Thanks for sharing. You could give it a week easily but 3 is enough to see the waterfalls and go to the night market and enjoy it. My preferred spot in Laos has been the Kong Lor Cave. The Hin Boun valley at that place is spectacular, and you can hike across the mountain with a local guide and return by boat through the gigantic cave. Worth checking out. Thanks for the info!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/i-became-a-mural-artist-in-vientiane-laos/,"I Became a Mural Artist in Vientiane, Laos",Laos,"Days 44-48 I was sitting across from Ben, the hostel manager at Vientiane Backpacker’s Hostel where I had planned to spend only one night to take care of a Thai tourist visa.  I had just connected to the horrendous wifi and had enough time, between loading pages, to get to know him as a Texan who had come to Laos on a whim and picked up a job at the hostel. Feeling a little more blunt than usual, I was all “Why in the world would travelers take jobs at hostels in exchange for room and board when the compensation works out to be, like, $2 hourly? That just seems ridiculous.” He pointed to a mural on the wall and said they had made that very offer to the artist.  I replied “well that’s arts and crafts time. I freakin’ love arts and crafts time! That’s a completely different deal than slanging drinks and party flyers.” As easily as that, the plan was hatched.  I was going to paint a mural on the hostel wall in the lobby in exchange for room and board, and beer, of course. Obviously I couldn’t agree to the deal without BEER! And it was going to be huge! Crazy Michael, the hunchbacked hostel owner with exactly one speaking volume (which is one decibel above shouting), had me jump on the back of his motorbike and with that, we were off to the paint store – an overstuffed Home Depot-like retailer all squashed into a few square feet space (I can’t give you the measurements in the metric system.  I know, I’m working on it).  We bought red, blue, and yellow paint, two brushes, and some paint thinner. I was about to paint the largest piece I had ever done, mixing all of my own colors, going completely free hand.  Oh, and I hadn’t painted for nearly 5 years, oh, and all I had done were landscapes before (but I didn’t really advertise that last bit of information). They were blindly putting their faith in me. I wasn’t sure exactly what to create, but after walking around the wat (Buddhist temple) across the street, inspiration hit me and a tattooed elephant came to mind, wearing all of the symbols of life I saw around me. Day one was spent sketching, nervously looking to Michael and Ben for approval, and trying to ignore the pressure of onlookers.  I hadn’t considered that I’d have an audience throughout this entire process.  The next day I got to work finishing the painting, listening to music, and sweating in the blistering Vientiane heat. Every now and then someone would stop by and look pensively at my work, and give me a thumbs up. I’m insecure, I need approval. This helped me tremendously. The final product, drumroll please: I patted myself on the back, inadequately washed the paint off of myself while the guest house staff alternated between nodding and screaming something in a tongue I couldn’t understand when I was about to wash a bowl or paintbrush out in the “wrong” sink or with the “wrong” technique. I thought I’d head out the next day.  I only intended to be there for one night and had already extended to three, after all. But then, crazy Michael interjected. “Please Ava. Pleeeaaase help us! I want my guest house BEST guest house in Vientiane. You paint more. I pay you.” What’s that you say?! Cold hard cash? Yes. Sold. I’ll stay. The next day, My feet killing me and my body extremely tired from the previous two 8-hour days of painting, I set back to work.  Now each of the dorm rooms have themes! I left Vientiane the next day – four days after I had originally planned.  I suppose that’s the serendipity of travel.  Even better, I met a few girls in Luang Prabang a week later who spoke about staying in the ‘tiger’ room at their hostel.  I realized it had to have been the mural I painted. “That was you?!” they exclaimed. It felt damn good. So, I take everything I said about not working at a hostel back.  I’ll happily paint in exchange for room, board, and beer any time.  Have a bare hostel wall? Contact me (seriously) I’ll come paint it. Have you ever picked up an odd job while traveling? Comment below! That elephant is totally impressive. And, you’ve left a piece of you in Laos. People you don’t know will remember your elephant for years. I bet you can find other hostels (and other venues) that would be happy to trade some room and board for a mural. You can sketch your ideas while you’re whiling away hours on uncomfortable trains and buses or during interminable layovers at airports. Come visit Philadelphia where public art is all about murals. http://muralarts.org/about Thank you! I thought if it that way as well… I’ve left my mark and who knows? Maybe it’ll be there in a few years.  Would be great to travel around painting, come back, and see what stuck. Great elephant. And Stanley suits it I think. Love your tiger as well. Wishing I was artistic now, all that free beer … Yeah, it was the beer that drew me in. I’m so glad this came up in my Google Reader, what an amazing story. I can’t believe you did that, how cool! And you totally pulled it off by the way, the murals look awesome. Why thank you, I’m blushing 🙂 That’s so awesome!! You go girl. Seriously, you could start doing nurseries or something if you move back to the States, haha! That’s not a bad idea! I’ll need to get in shape first. Painting is hard work! Well done! The elephant looks like a huge project and it turned out great. So much detail! 😀 Thanks much 🙂 You’re brilliant! Terrific work, Ava. It’s pretty cool to think that you’ve left an actual piece of yourself in Vientiane. I bet few travelers can say that! I hope it sticks! Would love to go back and see it one day. You’re too kind, by the way This is really the best story. I love Stanley. Thank you 🙂 I could have created the “STICK MAN” room with my artistic talents! LOL  Great job and what fun!  🙂 Haha, I’m sure many hostels would love your stick man 🙂 Ha ha – I painted murals in trade for my accommodation in Hawaii! I finished my time there with a giant mural that covered the front corner of the building. Too much fun! 🙂 Wow! I thought the elephant looked familiar when I started reading the article. This was one of my favourite hostels ever. You did an amazing job 🙂 How exciting that you saw it! I’m glad it’s still there! I loved it too. What a great vibe it had going. Doesn’t matter that there are no anacondas in Laos? There are no real Anacondas in the hostel either so we just have to use our imaginations.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/4000-islands-laos-don-det/,"4000 Islands, Laos: Been There, Don Det",Laos,"Where in the world is 4000 Islands, and why in the world is it called that? Day 41 It’s around 4:30 in the afternoon and I’m floating down the Mekong River in 4000 Islands, Laos. Behind me is a group of backpackers, occasionally sticking their arms in the water to swim against the current and laughing as we struggle to remain one big mass of inner tubes, hand in hand, passing a bottle of Beer Lao around. A dazzling double rainbow lights up the sky before me. Unobstructed, we can see the entire arc in her full glory, lighting our way back to Don Det (the one island out of the 4000 I’m staying on). We just came from a beach BBQ on a tiny island where local monks plant and harvest vegetables. When they’re not around, two tiny kittens guard it. They happily shared their space with us today in exchange for a few bites of fresh river fish. It’s a Tuesday afternoon and I think back to what I was doing a year ago today, slumped in my cubicle and wishing for days like this. 4000 Islands sits just north of the border in Cambodia.  A bus ride then a quick boat jaunt from the mainland gets you to the hippie haven of Don Det, which attracts a chill crowd of travelers who spend most of our time lazily reading books and swapping travel stories on decks over the mighty Mekong river. The otherwise rural stretch of islands is dotted with modest bungalows on stilts that cater to the backpacker crowd.  Ranging anywhere from $3-$6, depending on whether the bathroom is ensuite or not, one can easily stay a week here without needing to spend much at all. Some people complain that there’s not much to do here on Don Det, but they simply haven’t looked around. kayaking tours take off daily in the early AM for the sporty travelers who feel like baking in the sun and getting an epic arm work out (read: not me). But I DID cycle around Don Det and crossed the bridge to neighboring Don Khong to view the waterfalls. The roads, as always in Southeast Asia, were simple dirt filled with potholes.  Only adds to the fun (and sore bum thereafter) if you ask me. Besides, where else could I have found this very special and important service offering? Or, if you want to do nothing at all but laze around on hammock and watch the river, this is a perfectly good locale. I know, I spent 2 full days here doing nothing but bumming around with the Longest Way Home in tow before actually deciding to be active in some capacity. Yes, 4000 Islands is the life.  The sun is setting and we’ve lost count as we try to see if there really are, indeed 4000 tiny islands.  We pull up to the shore of Don Det as some locals call out “sai ba dee” (hello) to us. Tonight, we’ll probably do what we do every night: lay around and talk about how we spent our Tuesday, trying to connect to the weak Wi-Fi to upload our Instagram photos, pressing ‘retry’ a few times, and finally giving up to accept the present moment. It’s the right thing to do, anyways. After all, who needs the interwebs when you have the river below your feet, good company all around, and another day of laziness (or biking, tubing, kayaking, etc.) ahead of you?  Not this girl. Certainly not this girl. Have you been to Don Det or a similar hippie metropolis? Am I capable of wearing anything other than my Chang beer shirt? These are both good questions.  Comment below! Can’t wait to catch up with you in SE Asia!!!! Reading this got me all excited. me too! I miss my chang beer shirt, I actually decided to give it away when I left to travel and now that I am back I wish I had it. I will happily procure one and send it your way. Let me know if you want me to! Sounds like so much fun. Longing for such lazy days. Arggghhh, I envy you! Haha, you can be lazy anywhere! I never made it to Don Det but this makes me wish I had! (Oh and I STILL wear my Chang beer shirt — one year after being in SE Asia. No shame in that.) I hope mine lasts that long, it’s getting dangerously close to some holes in the sides! I suppose I can get another for $3, though 😉 Great pic with the rainbow! Many thanks to me friend for snapping that. I will be there in 2 weeks, any recommendation for accommodation. Looking for room with balcony at the river, private bathroom, fan only is ok, limit maybe 30$ regards Max Nope, it’s still a different country. Just show up and you can find a guest house for as little as $3-$6 per day. any recomments for GH at the river Don Det was an absolute highlight. The locals were warm and friendly, our own host was a farmer that chatted to us whilst we read in hammocks and he built the foundations for a new bungalow. Cycling around the dusty islands and 8 hour Kayak trips… heaven. I definitely thought so too 🙂 I just read this from my hammock in Don Det. I will emphasise the sore bum from bike riding point. I just had to walk my bike part of the way back! The waterfall was incredible though! Can’t wait to go searching for the dolphins ?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/motorbiking-the-bolaven-plateau/,Offbeat Travel: Motorbiking the Bolaven Plateau,Laos,"Days 38-40 When I embarked on this solo journey I promised myself I’d seek off-the-beaten path adventures and take myself out of my comfort zone.  One of the biggest challenges I knew I’d face was becoming comfortable on a motorbike.  Five years earlier in Taiwan, I had dubbed them “chariots of doom” and refused to get on one for the entire eight months I lived there.  I had other options, such as the MRT, taxis, and my feet. In Southeast Asia, however, sometimes there is no other option to get where you want to go.  The Bolaven Plateau, famous for amazing landscape and waterfalls, is one of those destinations.  I knew the day was coming and after a little over a month into my trip, sure enough, it had arrived. The Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos is often skipped on the typical backpacker trail in favor of the more popular northern destinations of Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng (famous for the tubing).  Since I was heading north from 4000 Islands, I knew I wanted to confront my fears and give the Bolaven Plateau loop a try. I arrived in Pakse the night prior.  The city doesn’t have much to offer, but that didn’t stop my group of friends from hanging out with a local guest house owner who later took us to an all-Lao nightclub until the wee hours of the morning.  It was a flashback to my good times in Siem Reap. The next morning, my heart pounding, we rented 3 motorbikes for 6 bikers from our guest house.  Score! I wasn’t going to have to drive! But I was going to have to put my life in Morten’s hands – a Danish guy I had run into on the islands in Cambodia, and then Otres Beach, and then 4000 Islands. Luckily the roads are mostly paved and, despite the occasional pig, cow, goat, dog, or chicken running into the road, are mostly traversable without issue. The main reason why people bike out to this region is to check out the  beautiful waterfalls.  Typically, tourists take the afternoon to head to this waterfall, and then head back to Pakse: But we, ever the ambitious backpackers, decided to do the 4-day loop in 3 days. The highlights for me included the happy children who waved hello, (which reminded me of the enthusiastic kids in Kratie), the locals in the back of a truck who handed us bananas as we drove by (it was a hilarious exchange – props to Morten for engineering it by getting just close enough to the truck without crashing), and of course, feeling the mist on my face at my favorite waterfall, Tad Gneuang: I was in complete awe of the scenery in Laos.  I had thought Cambodia was beautiful, but honestly, Laos’ scenery blows it away.  I kept singing Welcome to the Jungle to myself in my head while taking in all of the different plants, giant butterflies, and ample waterfalls. Each one seemed more spectacular and remote than the last. We saw 5 waterfalls during our trip, and, can you imagine, we didn’t even see all there were to see! On our final day, in the remote outskirts of Sekong (where nobody spoke English and I never saw another Westerner – successfully offbeat indeed!) Morten swerved for this photo before we blasted back off to Pakse, me trying not to think about the possibility of crashing into a pig and Morten trying to sneak up another 10k or so when he thought perhaps I wasn’t paying attention to our speed: We arrived back in Pakse in one piece with minimal “slow down, Morten!”s from me. For anyone looking for a unique travel experience punctuated by beautiful scenery, I’d highly suggest the Bolaven Plateau loop. Do it yourself: Nice off the beaten track gem there Kristin. This place must have passed me by completely. I was in Pakse and Southern Laos in 2012 and didnt come across it. Like you, I often head to “off the beaten path” places! Most recently in Harar, Ethiopia, Sagaing in Myanmar and Nanchang in China. Safe travels. Jonny I’m definitely looking forward to Myanmar and China. Will be checking out your posts on those! I just found your blog and I have quickly become obsessed with it. I am currently in my cubicle counting down the days until February when I will be taking my backpack trip to SE Asia (possibly my first solo trip). Your blog is seriously pumping me UP!!!Thank you for the beautiful photos and great stories. Kylie That’s awesome Kylie thanks so much! Really useful tips that we used for our trip in July 2014. It definitely is a unique place and I think, as with most places, it is the people who make it so special. A ‘Sabai Di’ still sometimes slips out instead of a hello because of how many times we shouted it from the bike! Cheers. So glad it was helpful for your trip planning, and that it was still wonderful to visit almost years later!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sri-lanka-places-to-visit-itinerary/,Sri Lanka’s Best Places To Visit: The Perfect Itinerary,Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka is an island paradise with incredible variety. After years of civil war, the riches of this island nation were left largely ignored by travelers, but in recent years, more and more people have come with inquisitive eyes to be enriched by the soft soul of the Sri Lankan people, enchanting landscapes, golden beaches and some of the most flavorful food in South Asia, if not the World! Sri Lanka is right up there for travelers looking for a slightly off the beaten path destination whilst still being easy to navigate, budget-friendly, and offering sensational scenes and sounds aplenty! To get a real feel for Sri Lanka, we would recommend spending at least two weeks exploring the island country. Here is an example itinerary encompassing some of our Sri Lanka’s best places to visit! For those with an eye for landscapes and topography, Sri Lanka is home to manicured leafy lawns that spread for as deep as the eye can penetrate the horizon, and there are not much better viewing points than that atop the relatively moderate, 45 minute climb up to the summit of Pidurangala Rock. While many climb the ever popular Sigiriya Rock for the ancient ruins at the top, Pidurangala Rock (opposite and a little less popular) offers sweeping panoramas of both the Sigiriya rock column and the tropical terrain that surrounds it. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: Aside from checking out the stunning botanical gardens of Kandy, the real reason we were here was to catch the famous train ride between Kandy and Ella. How to get there: Sticking to stunning Sri Lankan scenery, it honestly doesn’t come as thick, fast, and varied as the train journey from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya or Ella. Dubbed largely as “the most scenic train journey in the World” jump on a train from Kandy to the rolling tea valleys of Nuwara Eliya and you will be treated to some of the most scenic valleys and plantations in the World. The trip from Kandy to Nuwara Eliya is around 4 hours, but if you just can’t get enough of the tea valleys, vistas and vivacious curves of the hills that the train ride offers, then choose to travel a further 2 and a half hours to the town of Ella. What to do: Where to stay: Operational railway bridges do not get any more epic than that of Demodara Bridge in Ella, commonly referred to as ‘Nine Arch Bridge’ or “Bridge In The Sky’ due to its colonial-era, 9 stone structural arches that form its beauty. Situated within deeply forested terrain, train crossings are frequent, a sight to behold, and can be eyed from either the viewpoints at each end of the track or from below where you will find local ladies picking Ceylon tea from the rolling tea plantations.  It’s like a scene from the movies! How to get there: What to do: Where to stay:  No list of beautiful places is complete without a hike or a trek, but the views waiting at the top of Little Adam’s Peak could make the list all by itself! Located in Ella, the area is famed for its monumental mountain range and Ceylon aromas dissipating from the tea fields. Any local will point you in the right direction to the start of the trail from the flower garden in Ella. Winding through the valley with a slight incline the trek doesn’t take long, is relatively easy to navigate and offers sensational sunset or sunrise spots to view the peaks, ridges and craggy mountainscape with unparalleled 360 degree views. What to do: If you want to hike the real Adam’s Peak, prepare for a longer sunrise trek, but one that’s worth the effort. You’ll have to work in a couple of extra days to get there and back from Ella, but as anyone who has done it can tell you, it’s worth it if you have the time. You can read more about Adam’s Peak here.  Sri Lanka’s East coast tends to get far fewer visitors than the south coast, but if you’re interested in surfing uncrowded waves and hanging in a little fishing village with more chances for local interaction, then consider heading to Arugam Bay. It might mean cutting out Mirissa if you’re on a tight schedule, but if it were me, I’d be just fine with that. For logistic’s sake, you’ll probably have to pick either this stop or stop #5 below, unless you have a bit more time and are willing to add in a bit more traveling, which is always an adventure in Sri Lanka! How to get there: Take the bus from Ella to Monaragala. From there, you can take a direct bus to Panama which stops in Arugam Bay. What to do:  Where to stay:  Hideaway Arugam Bay has the perfect vibe and lots of backpackers to hang with. Click here to read more about Sri Lanka’s East Coast. All good things are wild and free. Undoubtedly the best place to eye elephants in the WILD is in one of the National Parks, in which there are 15 of them in Sri Lanka! Unfortunately, there remains a desire to keep elephants captive to satisfy tourist desire, but this was one of the worst and saddest experiences in Sri Lanka, particularly in Pinnawala. No matter how much the locals try to convince you that all projects have been created with the elephants’ wellbeing at the forefront, we found this to be untrue. A sad elephant equals a sad experience. However, in Udawalawe wild encounters are frequent and more so poignant. These magnificent mammals will leave you mesmerized with memories to last a lifetime. All the strength and power in such a gentle giant, maybe there’s something we could all learn here. Aside from elephants, the park is a deeply forested area with lakes, jungle-like flora and fauna and a jeep safari through the terrain in search of gentle giants, as well as rare bird species and other mammals such as water buffalo and golden jackal is a journey of a lifetime. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: Lining the Indian Ocean on the eastern shores of Sri Lanka, Yala National Park is a 978.8 km² forested area home to some of Sri Lanka’s most sought after wildlife sightings including elephants, crocodiles and the king of Yala, the leopard. Although Yala National Park is one of the most popular national parks in Sri Lanka, it is also one of the largest, meaning you could safari for hours without another jeep in sight. Opt for a whole day safari and you will enter the park as the sun peaks above the horizon for the best time of the day to spot the leopards and stop for lunch at the beach where the salty air will freshen you up before your afternoon jeep safari. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: While Mirissa remains the most popular tourist beach across the south coast of Sri Lanka, nobody can deny how beautiful Coconut Tree Hill is. It’s a 15 minute bike ride from the main stretch of beach. Like all beautiful locations such as this, nothing is a secret forever, and the spot has gotten increasingly popular over the last two years. Still, it’s well worth a visit for the view. It’s almost as if the view has been painted as you view the shore through the leafy lush palms. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: Weligama means sandy village, which is pretty apt in fact! Weligama has made the list as one of the best examples of a fishing town in Sri Lanka which remains relatively quiet in relation to its southern beach counterparts, all the while still offering visitors various activities to keep busy. Travelers come for the surf, with outlets offering surf lessons for novices with a sprawling view of the coastline to match. Weligama is becoming more popular while the word of its coves and coast spreads, so be sure to check it as soon as you can! How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: The beauty of Ahangama is the laid back approach to life away from the tourist towns! Located in the Southern Province and about 20 minutes from the popular town of Galle, Ahangama is a less visited stretch of coastline in the South offering a more local way to experience the shores. The sleepy town offers secluded beaches, local jaunts and the opportunity to view the uniqueness of traditional stilt fishing famed throughout Sri Lanka. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay:  While many visit the South Coast for its golden stretches of sand (and rightly so), be sure to make the short distance inland from the shore and experience the majesty and magnificence of Koggala Lake. Penetrated by misty jungle, the lagoon outflows to the Indian Ocean and is made up of eight ecologically rich islets, some of which can be best explored by boat such as the spice gardens of Cinnamon island. How to get there: What to do: Where to stay: Here’s a map with all of the spots mentioned above, plus the recommended accommodations to help you plan your trip:  While it’s a lot to take in, considering Sri Lanka is bigger than meets the eye, you can probably see that there’s no bad place to go and no wrong way to enjoy Sri Lanka.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cost-of-travel-in-sri-lanka/,Tips from the Banker: The Real Cost of Travel in Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka is a truly gorgeous country near India with friendly people, sprawling jungles, tons of interesting wildlife, and endless beaches. I spent just shy of three weeks there and found it to be a perfectly feasible budget destination, with cheap transportation options, reasonable food costs, and decent room rates. Like most countries, Sri Lanka can be seen on a backpacker budget, or one can spend a small fortune there.  The biggest kicker was the price of activities, such as safaris, and admission into the UNESCO World Heritage sites.  With each running about $40-$50 per ticket, this made Sri Lanka more expensive to fully explore.  That said, skipping these activities would have meant missing out on a big reason why Sri Lanka is such a wonderful place to visit. My daily average came out to $50/day.  This may come as a surprise since I spent about 8 months in Southeast Asia previously, averaging about $30/day and doing things as cheaply as possible.  Part of that was out of necessity, but mostly, I just saw it as a personal challenge and I wanted to see if it was doable. Now I know, and I’m simply not as willing to do things so cheaply these days.  I tend to want my own room more, I want to stay in nicer places, I have been moving more quickly lately, which makes the costs add up, and just haven’t been trying as hard to do everything on a shoestring budget. That said, Sri Lanka can be done on closer to $30 per day on the days that you don’t pay for expensive activities.  Food, transport, and accommodation are relatively cheap. I didn’t stay in any dorms while in Sri Lanka.  Given I’m a solo traveler, this meant I had to book private rooms and shoulder the cost myself.  I typically spent about $10-$15 per night on a room, but some nights spent a lot more wanting to stay somewhere nice.  Budget accommodation was easier to find in the more touristy towns, such as Galle, than the lesser-visited places such as Dambulla. Sri Lanka isn’t as much of a backpacker destination, so the options are just not as plentiful as in, say, Thailand, where a $5 dorm room is easy to find, but you can definitely find hostels with reasonable price and great facilities in all major cities. Hostels in Colombo: $6-$14 (book your hostel in Colombo here) Hostels in Ella: $6 – $14 (book your hostel in Ella here) Hostels in Galle: $8-$16 (book your hostel in Galle here) Hostels in Arugam Bay: $7-$16 (book your hostel in Arugam Bay here) If, like, me, you’d like to mix in a few nights of nicer accommodation, I recommend Amaya Beach Resort on Passikudah beach. and Trinco Blue in Trincomalee! There are a lot of varying price options for transport.  It’s not atypical in Sri Lanka to hire a car and driver, which usually runs about $50 per day.  The driver tends to sleep in the car, or your accommodation of choice will have sleeping quarters for the driver.  He covers the associated costs though you tend to cover his food when he’s on the clock. During my first week there, I split this with a friend who was on a much shorter trip. We explored the places the train doesn’t access this way. Otherwise, buses are a very cheap option at just a few dollars for a 6-hour ride, though they are typically packed until it’s standing room only.  People continue to pile into the point that they get very uncomfortable.  I rarely came across one with air conditioning.  Tickets are sold on board and buses leave when full. Uber and PickMe are available in major cities – you can even order tuktuks via the apps. They are much cheaper than hailing a tuktuk off the road. A short distance ride can cost less than $0.30. Taking the train was my personal favorite option.  Pricing for the second-class cabin ran anywhere from $1.50 to $4 and was a real delight.  These also sometimes run out of seats, though, meaning you may have to stand or sit on the floor. The food is delicious in Sri Lanka, but unfortunately, lunches are often a buffet that has been sitting out for a while.  I was able to get around this by visiting roti stands around lunch time where the food was made fresh. Typical lunches ran about $3-5, though it’s somewhat common for a driver or tour guide to take you to much more expensive lunch places that run about $20.  You simply have to say you’re not interested in that type of place. Beer was nice and cheap at around $2-$3 for a large bottle. Dambulla was the most expensive simply because Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya Rock charged a rather ridiculous admission fee of around $30 each for a foreign visitor.  Safaris in the area were also a bit steep at around $60 per person. Galle, Ella, and Kandy were cheaper given they had more accommodation options and are easier to get around. Besides, most of the activities here involve visiting tea plantations or going on hikes, both of which are cheap or free. I found that the accommodation ranging between $20 and $60 was actually no better than the rooms that cost more like $10-$15.  There really didn’t seem to be much reason to spend over $10 on a room in Sri Lanka, unless one stays at a luxury hotel or apartment for more like $90+. SIM cards in Sri Lanka are nice and cheap running at about $18 for 10 gigs of 4G (on the Dialog network, which worked very well and can be purchased at the Colombo airport).  Topping up only cost a few dollars as well. Overall, Sri Lanka can be a cheap place to visit, but the cost of activities can really drive up the price.  Missing out on the UNESCO sites and safaris would have really been unfortunate.  Consider this when planning your trip! Great and helpful post.  The plan is to try to make it there when I’m in SE Asia so it’s nice to see that it’s still affordable even with all the activities and UNESCO sites. You could pop over from Kuala Lumpur for not too much cash. Sometimes a shoestring budget taints a trip or taking a bus 24 hours to save some cash is more detrimental. I’m sure you could have done Sri Lanka within that $30 cap, but it seems like the extra spending went to some amazing activities. I’m about $30 a day, though rarely do I reach it in Thailand. But still, I also haven’t been doing many activities. Sometimes I’m feeling like I’m missing out, others I feel vindicated in my savings, but it’s always best to do what you want and try to keep it within a reasonable range. Well, in SE Asia for example, I skipped the Gibbon experience in Laos, spend the extra time on busses, and did things like climb Kinabalu in one day because two days cost too much. BUT I never skip out on SCUBA diving.  It’s your vacation, your life, and money is supposed to support that, not make it harder or less enjoyable! This is a really informative post!! I’ve never thought about traveling through Sri Lanka. My grandparents lived there for a while when I was a kid and always sent me cool postcards from there. This has sparked an interest…thanks! I hope you do! We have had to choose between places because of our budget. When entry tickets for one are more than flights for two you really have to think. Will share our trip soon True, but then you have to think, when will I be here again? If it’s what you went there to see then, it is what it is, sadly. Great post, really happy to see this ahead of my trip to SL next week! Did you go to Unawatuna when you were in Galle? That’s where I stayed. They’re neighbors 🙂 My least favorite place, though. I loved the center the most. Um, yeah… We did Sri Lanka as a holiday, back in the glorious days when we had paychecks, so didn’t really mind splurging a bit. The UNESCO sites are expensive though – but worth it, as you say. We traveled mostly by bus and train, with the occasional taxi when nothing else was available. I wouldn’t say it was our cheapest holiday (although food was amazing and we hardly spent any money on it), but it was one of the most memorable – we actually wrote a roundup post recently, all from memory. Would be curious to see how much the country has changed since we visited. Great post, congrats! Good luck and safe travels! When was that? I’d say the food and transport is still cheap but I sincerely can’t comprehend why the UNESCO sites cost so much. it’s so frustrating to see that only foreigners pay those prices too, but that’s the case all over SE Asia as well. Sri Lanka just seems absolutely incredible! It is definitely a place on my list. Did you visit Indian while you were over there? I have been curious about going but haven’t made up my mind. Glad you had a great time, I love when you do your tips from a banker it is extremely helpful! and p.s. My pacsafe arrived today and I just purchased my travel insurance through your blog! Hope it helps & happy travels! Kylie I’ve never been to India but I really want to check it out! If you are ever looking for a travel buddy for India let me know 🙂 haha Absolutely! Interesting post. This information is extremely important, especially for planning a vacation trip to suit any budget. This will be a reference for me. I really want to vacation in Sri Lanka, but the information that I get a little still. and it will become a reference that could facilitate our holiday in Sri Lanka. nice post. I really like your blog! I’m planning to head over to Sri Lanka this summer, I’ve been all over SEA and am not usually overly worried about warnings (if you dress appropriately and go with your guts everything’s usually fine), however the negative comments about traveling solo a female in SL seem quite numerous.. I was wondering how you experienced traveling solo through the country? Really? What have you heard? I felt totally fine there! Glad to see the amount of hostels is growing. That must mean tourism is on the up and up. Have a great time and yes, I think you can keep it under $25/day if you take public transport instead of private and eat at the roti-type of food establishments rather than at expensive restaurants. Things have changed in Sri lanka with lots of good clean safe hostels in operation. Mirissa on the southern coast has some lovely hostels hangover hostel is one Hey ! we are going to sri lanka in two weeks ! can you give any contact to your private driver ?? It was from our Airbnb host but you can find them easily I am travelling Srilanka this year. Any tips what all to see to get a cultural experience? Thanks Great post, thanks! I had a question about traveling solo as a female, I’m going for about $40 a day (with the expensive cultural sites factored in too) . It sounds like you didn’t feel threatened at any time: other than the usual (conservative dress, no traveling at night, keep watch on your stuff, be confident), is there anything else that you think really helped you feel at ease and have a good trip?? For context, I will be alone only in Ella and the Cultural Triangle area (and getting between them on busses and trains). Thanks again! Hold your head up high and act confident, even when you don’t feel confident, and listen to your gut instincts. It’s a friendly place and I didn’t feel threatened there. Hi! Loved your post. I’m thinking of traveling to Sri Lanka next September and just started to plan on it. Budget also. So your post is very usuful. Since you wrote it in 2014, if you have some updated information, please let me know. 🙂 I’ll be there again in June! I expect it to be similar, though. Great post! really appreciate the information.  When traveling to different cities did you know prior to your arrival that there would be rooms for $10-15? Or was it like you showed up a looked/asked around. I definitely want to see as much of the island as possible but i definitely don’t want to get caught paying 90+ at some hotel because I wasnt able to locate a more affordable rate close by ya know? and this personal driver will take you literally anywhere for $50 per day (plus food and accommodations)? Hey Brandon, I just showed up and asked. A lot of places aren’t online and you can’t book ahead. I don’t usually plan ahead in Asia unless it’s a major holiday and that’s never been a big problem. Yes on the question about the driver. I have been wondering about the high costs in Sri Lanka. Tax seems to be the issue. http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2017/09/19/features/high-taxes-and-bad-policy-spike-lanka%E2%80%99s-food-prices I still think it’s pretty cheap. Hi,Is $50 a day including safari’s and scuba? I’m also wondering if you found it cheaper to book things like the safari when you got there?  Thank you! Sometimes that can cost extra, depending on how many people you can split the safari car with. Yes I always book in person in developing countries. Much cheaper in general. I am from sri lanka and the post is also nice and interesting 🙂 well the prices in sri lanka depends on the places and with the people too 🙂 mostly you can do it around 30$ yes 🙂 well i will recommend you all jaffna trincomalee and arugambay for beaches too 🙂🙂 they are also beautiful like unawatuna ❤️ if you are willing to watch dolphins then you must go to kalpitiya or mirissa 🙂 best places to accomodate in sri lanka are Negombo , colombo , marawila, unawatuna  and Galle ❤️ hope you all enjoy sri lanka 🙂 better have a friend in sri lanka that will help a lot 🙂 with prices Hi, nice blog.I want to just go to the Kathirkamam murugan temple from the airport. stay at night and visit the temple next day morning and fly back to Kul. What is the best option. I do not know anyone in Srilanka.  any tour company or taxi you recommend?thanks I actually use Uber there and think it’s great! It should be noted that UNESCO sites all around the world are expensive…the funding goes into their upkeep.I have no problem with foreigners paying more…just remember most of the locals would be earning no more than $10 a day. I make it a point to skip at least half the attractions in a country when I visit, that way, next time I come I will have something I haven’t seen before.. Works great, and I save money! That’s one way to do it.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/yala-national-park-safari/,"The Silly, Silly Animals of Sri Lanka",Sri Lanka,"Animals can be pretty hilarious.  It’s no surprise that the most popular Vine videos out there are of cats and dogs and websites like LOLCats are so well known. I hadn’t realized this extended to the rest of the animal kingdom, however, until I took a safari in Sri Lanka. Yala National Park is the most visited wildlife preserve in Sri Lanka.  Located in the southern part of the country, it’s home to more than 40 varieties of mammal, and more than 200 bird species. So it is no surprise that every few minutes a new creature flew, bounded, crawled, or ran by the safari vehicle.  Everything from wild boars, to elephants, to big cats and even bigger lizards make Yala their home. The national park is divided into 5 parts, with 2 of them open to the public. I didn’t realize what jokesters they were until I went through my photos later, laughing at just about every other snapshot I had. I can just imagine what the animals might have been saying, if they could speak human: All kidding aside, the animals in Sri Lanka were absolutely magnificent and truly impressive.  In just a few hours on safari, I saw tons of amazing animals, including one I’ve wanted to see my whole life: a Leopard. Yala has the highest concentration of Leopards in the world, but even at that, there are only about 25 living in Block one where jeeps bring tourists.  All things considered, we were very lucky to spot one. Much more easy to spot were the white spotted deer: …and the wild boars: I knew it was a sign I was getting hungry when I started asking questions like, “how does it taste? Can you eat it?” when we passed by the deer, pigs, Water Buffalo, and rabbits. Then there were birds.  There are tons of colorful high flyers in Yala.  The Toucans, also a first for me to see, were quite a sight with their massive beaks: The Painted Storks could be seen just about everywhere: Eagles are always exciting to see as well: Along with Green Bee-Eaters (what a name!): The cherry on top, without a doubt, was seeing a Peacock give a wail and spread out his plumage, proudly showing off to just about anyone who would pay attention: The way Yala National Park was teeming with life was incredible.  One moment I’d see a fox, then in the foreground a monitor lizard would crawl by, all while white-spotted deer bounded in the background and crocodiles hunted in the rivers. The scenery was incredible as well: The experience of a safari in Sri Lanka was a memory I’ll treasure forever.  I had no idea that the wildlife here was so impressive, and am glad to have had a chance to see it for myself. Do it yourself (independently): If you would rather book a tour from Colombo inclusive of transport, here are a couple of options: Ohmygosh! Look at that peacock!! Have you ever met one in real life? They are seriously the meanest birds I have ever encountered! I was cornered by a flock of the females (they are a boring brown) on my way to my car one morning when I was living in Texas.. absolutely terrifying! haha I took that pic of the peacock but I wasn’t close enough to get cornered! I couldn’t stop laughing at the pics either, especially the little elephants!! So cute. They’re so funny! wow, the animals are gorgeous!!! You’ve captured them well too.  This post is probably my fave of all of your posts.  GJ! Thanks Ira! Love the photos!  The stork with the huge frog was quite impressive and the peacock is gorgeous-I have a similar picture of one that didn’t need any editing either and I now have as one of my business card pictures because I love it so much. It’s amazing how colorful they are. So impressive! Those are great shots!  And I love the tips at the end…we are aiming to go to Sri Lanka later this year so this safari is now on our to-do list! Thanks! You’re going to love it. OMG I was just in Sri Lanka, and seeing your pictures makes me miss that little country so MUCH!! I am loving your pictures and cant wait to keep reading about all your adventures. Enjoy and do yourself a favor eat up all the pumpkin curry and hoppers you can!!! I ate lots of hoppers there! egg, curd and honey, and then there was the roti and amazing curries. Such good eating in Sri Lanka! Thanks 🙂 that elephant is smiling so fuggen hard. i love it! So nice to see happy elephants! Wow!!!! What great captures! The baby elephant looks hilarious. All these animals have such funny expressions. Thank you so much for sharing! I don’t think I have seen animal pictures like these before. 🙂 Awesome captures Kristin, just awesome. You captures most of the Yala there, Elephants, Leopards Peacocks   etc. You are excellent with wild life photography, I can say it with these photos. hi,The great post.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/trincomalee-arugam-bay-sri-lanka-east-coast/,Arugam Bay to Trincomalee: The Best of Sri Lanka’s East Coast,Sri Lanka,"When in Sri Lanka, the locals always want to ask me what I think of it. These are usually Uber drivers bringing me to or from the airport, which for some reason, between going to the Maldives, coming back, popping over to Indonesia, then coming back, I did a lot of this June. (Sidenote: from the city center to the airport only cost like five bucks in an Uber in Sri Lanka. Win!) I have come to absolutely love taxicab conversations during my travels, so allow me to take you to the East Coast of Sri Lanka through my most recent taxi cab confession: He asks if I like traveling in Sri Lanka. I tell him that it ticks all the boxes: I tell him I was here about two years ago. It was a layover from the Maldives that I decided to deplane for. It wasn’t really planned, it was more about taking the opportunity to explore a place that hadn’t been on my radar before. I didn’t have any idea of what Sri Lanka would be like. It’s only quite recently that the 26-year civil war ceased and it started to become a hub for tourism, particularly in the harder-hit east and north, so there just wasn’t much info out there on it yet. These days, the driver and I agree, there are more and more people coming from abroad to visit this gorgeous place. I have certainly seen the growth since I’ve been gone. There is construction all over the capitol city of Colombo, The waves of the East Coast are becoming famous enough to draw surfers from all over the world, and last time I was here, I was the only foreigner on the train. This time, I saw backpackers here and there. Sri Lanka is by no means a ‘touristy’ place yet, but rather pleasantly on its way. If handled correctly, and it seems that it is so far, it could be a real benefit to the local economy, otherwise bolstered by tea and textile exports. There are a few things that were quite a pleasant surprise to my first time here. I never expected for Sri Lanka to be a Safari destination. I could not believe that I saw elephants, leopards, all kinds of gorgeous birds, monitor lizards, and wild pigs all in the same day when I took a safari in Yala National Park. In my mind I always just thought that was in Africa. I guess that’s what traveling does, doesn’t it? Makes you realize that there is so much more to this world than those commonly-held beliefs. But that was last time I was here. This time it was all about a little something different: After months spent in the mountains of Patagonia I needed to practice some ocean appreciation. So I headed to the somewhat lesser developed East Coast to see what the sea looks like over there, and I made a few amazing discoveries! Arugam Bay on the East Coast of Sri Lanka is the perfect little hippie town, full of surfers, backpackers, and locals. The sandy beach is covered in little fishing boats, but the surfers point is its match with boards. I recall my friend Adam saying to me that it reminded him of Tofo in Mozambique and I totally understood where he was coming from. It sure had the same characteristics in that you kind of wondered how people ended up there, like it was some kind of special secret, and it probably wasn’t their first time abroad. They were probably pretty interesting people, and if you spent any measurable amount of time there, you would probably find it incredibly hard to leave. It’s the kind of place where beach bars line the sand. It’s where hammocks sway in the breeze and the air is so hot and sticky you just can’t resist the seductive urge to jump into the ocean for some vitamin sea. My time there was too short, but I will file that in the ever-growing folder of places that I would love to return to one day. Here’s the hotel I recommend there. It was laid back with some cool people and great food. I found another gem, too, but in sharp contrast to Arugam Bay, it’s a beach full of resorts. It’s tranquil and there aren’t many backpackers around, but if I ever end up on a honeymoon, this is definitely on the list. Locals told me it’s the best beach in Sri Lanka, but first allow me to point out this amazing pool: This is Amaya Beach Resort (which you can book here). I just popped by this resort for a few hours and had lunch there, but I’m so, very, incredibly interested in coming back and spending a week, or month, or maybe forever there. It was just gorgeous. I will always love my bamboo bungalows that include nothing but a fan but more and more I’m starting to love a really nice hotel, too. Chalk it up to my advancing age, I guess! In Trincomalee I stayed at Trinco Blu by Cinnamon and thought the rooms with their own little balconies were excellent, plus I love a partially outdoor shower, which my room had. I had heard of Trincomalee the last time that I was in Sri Lanka but regretfully hadn’t had the time to stop by. I’d received the intel, however, that it’s good for diving and is supposed to be the best spot on Sri Lanka’s East Coast for such things – Particularly Pigeon Island. I headed out there early in the day to see what the fuss was about. The reefs are shallow so I just snorkeled but being in the water at all is my happy place. Now if you want to do this, you better get there early. Word has gotten out about the island is popular. I was able to charter a little fisherman’s boat via Trinco Blu but no doubt there are tour operators everywhere offering this trip in the area. Though some of the reef was damaged in the 2005 tsunami, you still have a chance to see some cool stuff and in general Trincomalee is the perfect mix between resort and laid-back beach. No-matter what walk of life you come from there’s an option for you here. It felt to me like something between Arugam Bay and Passikudah. — As I pulled into the airport for the final time the driver asked if I thought I would come back. He tells me that he is from Ella, one of my favorite parts of Sri Lanka, and that he loves house music. He’s young, perhaps in his early 20s. I pull out my remaining local cash and hand it all to him because I do know that I will be back, but I just don’t know when. It’s not much but I tell him to use it on a night out. His eyes widen and a smile stretches across his face. He’s just like almost everyone I have met here, super friendly, super warm, and very kind. Yes I absolutely will come back, because like I said, Sri Lanka ticks all the boxes. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Cinnamon Hotels. All opinions about Sri Lanka’s awesome beaches and warm people are entirely my own.  Absolutely on my list! I have always been fascinated by Sri Lanka and I would love to spend some time there one day. I have just started solo traveling (not full time but as much as possible) and I’m hooked. I love traveling with my bf or friends but there is just something about going somewhere new by yourself. Having to figure out everything on your own builds some serious confidence! I do have one question.. How do you overcome jet lag quickly? It takes me a couple days even just going from one side of the country to the other. TIA! I don’t let myself sleep until it’s really bed time, no matter how tired I am. I go out and explore or hang with friends or people at the hostel to stay stimulated until it’s at least a reasonable time to sleep You know, I barely thought of Sri Lanka at all until a few years ago, but now I keep seeing it on Instagram and I’m dying to go – especially to Yala National Park. It looks like my dream destination – wildlife, amazing temples, hiking, and a dash of beach time (I go a bit nuts if all there is to do is lounge on a beach for a few days!). Glad to hear it’s so accessible and safe for solo female travelers as this is definitely a trip I’d be making solo. I had no idea what Sri Lanka had to offer before going and I was so blown away. It’s newish on the tourism scene which is why I think it still has so much charm. Just be prepared for taxi drivers heckling you but nothing in particular, really. Hi Kristin,We are going to Sri Lanka in October.  I would love to visit the east coast but we have a toddler – is there a plane that flies do you know?  from Colombo to the east coast?  Thank you and loved your post – it’s made me very excited:)) Yes you can fly. Check out Cinnamon air I went from Arugam Bay to Trincomalee then flew back to Colombo, though you could do public transport the whole way 🙂 Hi, my boyfriend and I are trying to decide between Trincomalee and pasikuda…which one would you recommend?Thank you! Vera I liked Pasikuda better. Hi!All the places sound amazing! My friends and I are planning to go in August and are a bit confused about which beach area to go too! What would you recommend for a group? Were not surfers and mostly want a lively beach to tan & swim and somewhere with a nightlife. Thank you in advance! 🙂 check out Galle 🙂    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-books-for-traveling-in-asia/,The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia,Sri Lanka,"Reading is where I get the majority of my enjoyment these days. Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships. This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads. This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:    First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers by Loung Ung This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today.  It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading. It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.  Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute by Bua Boonmee First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is incredibly eye-opening. I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the Thai sex industry have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.  Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam by Andrew X. Pham This book was a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me. I personally really loved visiting Vietnam. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.  Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal by Conor Grennan Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal. Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family. Sold by Patricia McCormick Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world  in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change. (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)  What Makes You Not a Buddhist by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse The title of this book really is misleading.  It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger. I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a 10-day silent meditation in Thailand. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding. This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.  I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone! A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack. It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn. — I read all of my books on a Kindle because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books. Given I’m usually reading 2-3 at a time, I need them in electronic format. Plus, I can keep highlights and clippings of the books for later reference – which I do make use of. I am always looking to add to this list, so if you know of a great read, let me know! Lastly, these are affiliate links, which means if you make a purchase via the link, I get a very small percentage of the sale price. It’s not much but it does help me maintain this website. Now that I think about it, if you have someone special in your life that is traveling soon, one of the best gifts would be these books loaded on a Kindle. Just a thought! Happy travels.   I love this because I always try to read a book about the place I’m traveling to/in. I also appreciate that you highlighted books written by people who actually live or are from those countries. I think both  perspectives (insider vs outsider) are good, but I always tend to lean to the home country authors. Last, I read Catfish and Mandala about 10 years ago and I still remember how good it was! Which is at lot considering I often can’t remember books I read last year:) I like the first-hand narrative style of people from the countries as well. Sometimes it’s an outsider who wrote it as in the cases with the Nepal books, but the others gave me a better insight, I felt. Hi,I was going through the comments, and saw your reply asking for the affiliate link of the book Nothing to Envy. I will take this opportunity to send the link to youHere’s the link:Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea I loved your website and articles. You are doing a great job! Thanks and thanks! “The Red Market” by Scott Carney.By no means is this an uplifting book either but it does show you a dark world hidden within some countries like India, Philippines, & China.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061936463 It’s important to understand all aspects, I think. Not just the good parts. Thanks for the recommendation! Ah, amazing! I was just thinking one of my aims for my trip next year should be to read at least one book about each country I visit. This is a great selection to get me started. Wish I had some recommendations for you, I plan to have many by the end of my trip! Great then I look forward to your eventual recommendations! I know a must-read for Myanmar- From the Land of Green Ghosts http://www.amazon.com/From-Land-Green-Ghosts-Burmese/dp/0060505230 Awesome, thank you! Thank you, Kristin for your great list of book. Next week I will go to Myanmar and I was glad find book about this country in comment to this post. Now I read “From the Land of Green Ghosts” and expect very interesting travel. I just love the commenters on this blog! They’re so helpful. Anything on China? I’m heading there in a few days. I’ve been reading China in Ten Words by Yu Hua, which has been a fairly easy read and talks about the author’s upbringing during the Cultural Revolution, among other things. I’m definitely going to check out What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Thanks! I’ve read a lot of textbooks about China, especially modern Chinese politics (it was an area of study for me at University) but not as many memoirs. A good friend of mine loves My Several Worlds by Pearl S. Buck. There’s a novel called To Live by Yu Hua that you might find very interesting. It’s about a formerly rich family’s struggle as Mao rises to power. There actually are a lot of memoirs about China, too many of them. The most popular ones are Peter Hessler’s books, works by Xinran, Wild Swans, Wild Grass, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. I personally recommend Ancestral Leaves by Joseph W. Esherick, which chronicles his wife’s family through most of Modern Chinese history. As a historian, he knows his facts. Many of them focus on the turbulence of the Mao Era or the strains on society caused by the neck-breaking  pace of development. Pearl S. Buck, writes from the Republican era. Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a good place to start for contemporary Chinese literature. He works tend to be a bit political and focus on Chinese society. Soul Mountain, also by a Chinese Nobel laureate for literature, Gao Xingjian, is in contrast a much more personal journey and doesn’t touch much on the social upheavals of the era. The Republican era was a golden era for Chinese arts and literature. Writers from that era, such as Lu Xun, Xiao Hong, Ba jin, Qian Zhongshu, and Lao Shu, are still deeply revered in modern Chinese society. Thanks so much for the suggestions, Paul! It’s clear to me now that I should have been reading a lot more books on China all along. It’s the country that fascinates me the most. Will definitely add some of these to my list of books to read and hopefully grow this post to include some of these. Oh, totally love this post. I’m always looking for books or movies that have the places I want to see in them. Great idea. 🙂 I absolutely adore The Lover for Vietnam. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Adapted from a book as well which I suppose I should have included here as I’ve read that one too but forgot about it until now! I’ve just started ‘Anil’s Ghost’ by Michael Ondaatje which touches on Sri Lanka during their civil war. So far I really love it – perhaps I am slightly biases since I was there in September and have a huge love for the country, but I would say it’s worth reading! I do as well since I was there about a year ago. Thanks for letting me know because I’d love to learn more about that beautiful island. Great list Kristen! I haven’t read Miss Bangkok, Sold, or What Makes You Not  Buddhist, but the others are great and really do have a lasting imrpession, especially when you read them in the country they’re set in. 🙂Reading books about different countries and their history, and other travellers’ account of their adventures is one of my favourite parts of travel!! You’ve read all the others? Nice! I guess great minds think alike. Out of those I’d recommend What Makes You Not Buddhist next, but that is my favorite book so I’m biased 🙂 For fiction, the Bangkok 8 series is interesting and entertaining. Certainly not an accurate representation of Thailand in general, but the author does highlight several finer points of Thai Buddhist practices and cultures that are fascinating and interesting to read about if you’ve spent some time there. I really enjoy books about Buddhism so I might like that one a lot. Ahhh thank you for the reminder that I have been meaning to read “First They Killed My Father” for three years now since first visiting Cambodia! Added it to the list. Great, great read. I just read a great book set in India, by Kiran Desai, called Hullabaloo In The Guava Orchard. A really easy, funny read, with engaging characters and great descriptive prose. Of course for fiction, there’s always Memoirs Of A Geisha, too, which I LOVE. One I really recommend is called Nothing To Envy, by Barbara Demick. There are accounts of six defectors who escaped North Korea during the massive famine that killed millions in the 90’s. Such a good book about a country that we don’t know that much about. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha as well! I read it in high school.  THANK YOU for the Nothing to Envy suggestion. I think I’ll read that next because N. Korea really fascinates me. If you have an affiliate link with amazon send it over 🙂 What a great list of books. Thanks! I think I’d start with the What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Its a great one to start with One of my absolute favorite books has always been Shantaram. I recommend it to everyone! Its a beautiful autobiography (some ppl do challenge this) of a convict from Australia who escaped prison and ran off to India. He really writes beautifully about living in the country and his adventures there.  And then of course if you want a lighter take on India, there’s always Holy Cow that helps balance off the two experiences =) I did read Shantaram and while I felt the guy was a good writer I just couldn’t get past his god complex. It bothered me. It did help me get a better feel for India (I guess?) but I didn’t love it enough for it to make the list. It was a compelling read, though. I give it a 6 out of 10. There are some great books here! Some of my favourites are A Fine Balance (India), Wild Swans (China), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan) and Ghostwritten (set in many locations, but the Mongolia story is my favourite). Maybe I should write my own post! Thanks for the recommendations! Looks like I need to do some China reading. Thanks for this list! I’m living in bangkok at the moment and really wanted some reading inspiration! What makes you not a Buddhist is honestly one of the most amazing books I’ve read, I’m going to spread the word it’s very rare to find something so grounded in fact and truth yet so magical at the same time. Keep doing what you’re doing – I love your blog! Xx Yay! I’m glad you liked the book! It really did change my life for the better. Oh, this brings back memories. I always used to try to read a book set in another country before I got there/while I was travelling around. I’m not quite sure when I got out of the habit. I’d like to do it again, though. Thanks for the inspiration! Always such a nice way to understand and appreciate a country’s history 🙂 I love to read about places that I’ve been too. I read a LOT of China books because it helps me grasp the country a bit more. You should check out Peter Hessler’s books – he’s an awesome writer. I’m really curious about the Buddhism book, it would be nice to learn a bit more. Awesome thank you. I think you’re the second to comment recommending Holy Cow so I’ll look that one up. The other sounds incredible as well. Thanks for the great list, I am excited to check these out. I always try to read books when traveling in a country – I feel like it gives so much great context and cultural understanding that you don’t always get just by interacting with locals. Here are a few that I found useful – for Cambodia – Report from the Stricken Land; for China – easily the best travel companion is China Road by Rob Gifford (also available as an excellent audio book); and for India – Inspite of the Gods – the rise of Modern India. All of these were written by journalists who covered these countries for decades and have plenty of anecdotes, historical knowledge and well rounded understanding of a range of subjects pertinent to these countries. Those are great suggestions! A lot on this list are written by locals but it would be great to get a journalist’s perspective as well. Thank you for the incredible list its helpful.. Great suggestions! I loved Catfish and Mandala! Although its not as deep and insightful… No touch monkey was a great lighthearted traveler’s book for southeast asia (and other parts of the world)… definitely recommend for a light read 🙂 Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely agree with the title at least! Thanks for the recommendation for: What Makes You Not a BuddhistGreat description and awesome read. Just finished the book this avo! Awesome I’m so glad you liked it! I was excited to see that a lot of people ordered that one. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone read it 🙂 I read “When Broken Glass Floats” while in Phnom Penh which is a similar memoir to First They Killed My Father. I had planned to read them both, but after the first one, I didn’t think I could handle reading about that tragic history again. The book reduced me to tears more than a few times, and like you say, made me appreciate the smiles and hospitality around the country so much more. The other books you’ve listed look great as well, Miss Bangkok looks powerful, and Bkk is one of my favourite cities ever – might have to read that one on my next plane ride there. Thanks! I cried too reading First They Killed My Father. I agree it might be tough to read two such memoirs back to back. I started reading one about a child soldier in Sierra Leone and wondered to myself why I read such tough books but then realized, it helps you appreciate the current situation much more and the need for love in this world more than ever. Hi Kristin, Did you use a travel guide in south east Asia? Awesome website by the way, inspiring and useful! X iris Nope. I never do. I get my ideas by talking to locals. Orwell’s first novel, Burmese Days, paints Colonial Burma in a satirical light and offers decent insight into old traditions such as chewing betel. It’s worth reading just to see Orwell’s nearly century old take on present day Myanmar as well as his stunning insights into the bureaucratic nonsense that came along with it. Thank you for the recommendation! Hi there, I really enjoyed reading your past updates and most recent post 🙂 I was recommended your blog by transient20s. I have just started on WordPress since I am just beginning my travels – not only to keep my own recording of the journey, but also to read other people’s recommendations and insights. Some of the stuff I have read so far is great and I would love if you had any other recommended bloggers etc for me to follow? I am 23 and my first post lists the places I will be visiting. Thank you! Rebecca x How kind of them to recommend me. Yes for sure! These are my faves: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-blogs/ I’ve always considered “The Beach” a must read for anyone visiting Asia, but I love your list. Will definitely try to read at least one of those books this year! I haven’t actually read it but based on the movie, can definitely see why. I was trying to think of things that are less based on fiction and more based on the culture of the countries, but should read that one as well. If you are travelling India I absolutely recommend “The God of Small Things” for some beautiful magic realism and accurate “images” of local kids. And of course I have to recommend the famous “the white tiger” also full of indian typical images and very very entertaining reading. Both Indian writers Would love to read them regardless! I love having a peek into a culture I’m not yet familiar with Yep, Catfish and Mandala is a good one. I read it long before I ever wen to SE Asia, but remember it as a compelling read. So compelling and well-written. I love reading people who are such great writers as they encourage me to improve. I loved Little Princes! I recently did a Buddhist temple stay here in Korea and loved my time there. I’ll definitely have to check out “What makes you not a Buddhist” as I really want to learn more about the religion.Thanks for the recommendation!Some of my favourites are Escape from camp 14, a book about one of the few people to have escaped from North Korea’s prisoner camps. A shocking but interesting read (although it came out recently that he had lied about a few things in the book)Into Thin Air is also a great read! I am so fascinated by North Korea so I’m definitely going to give that a read. Thank you for the suggestion! Are there book about Malaysia and How long can I use these book? I haven’t read one about Malaysia yet but when I do I’m happy to post about it! These are mostly memoirs and relevant any time. Thanks for the awesome list! I am definitely going to check them out, especially the one about Buddhism. When I’m in Thailand later this year I am going to check out a meditation retreat in a temple, so I should probably learn more about Buddhism first. 😛 That’s a really good idea and I was very glad I’d read that book prior to going simply to have the basics down when the monks referenced the Truths.  Is it this one you’re going to? Was a very profound experience for me: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/monastery-thailand/I have some tips to help you prep here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/suan-mokkh/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chillest-places-asia/,The 8 Chillest Places in Asia,Sri Lanka,"When you imagine the most peaceful place you’ve ever been, what comes to mind? I’ve been to places where, whether it’s because of a hippie vibe, a genuine feeling of peace, or just the amazing people around me (usually all three), it just feels chill, and I feel like I could stay there forever. I came to realize over time that these are the places I like the most. They’re usually small communities, very focused on the preservation and appreciation of nature, and the general feeling is one of calm. Here are the best of what I’ve discovered so far: Even the name, Ella, sounds all magical and beautiful. In Ella, plenty of bars and restaurants have lounge lofts with bean bags, coffee stops, and your typical corner roti man serving up meals for under a dollar. The train ride to or from this beautiful town is breathtaking as well (get the spot in the doorway!). Ella itself is full of waterfalls, wonderful hiking, and is bordered by tea plantations on both sides. I’ve said it before and will say it again: it’s some sort of unspoken rule that anywhere with tea plantations will and must be beautiful. Yubeng is located in the far west of China, right up against Tibet in Yunnan province. It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a sacred area and all along the trail to Yubeng prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it. I talk about Pai all the time. In life, in this blog, in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day. I could visit the Land Split, swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon. The thought has often crossed my mind to take up a longer term residence there at some point. Speaking of hippie paradises, Otres Beach in Cambodia might be the winner, at least when I was there a little over two years ago. Most visitors who spend a while there have the same routine: wake up, swim, have some muesli and green tea, buy a mixed bag of small and sweet banana, mango and pineapple from the fruit lady, have a few Anchor beers, swim, consider BBQ or a bonfire, rinse, repeat. Why not? It’s paradise incarnate with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water. Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared. It’s easy to laze away in Don Det, reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world. I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali. Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street. Dali is relaxed, it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it. Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous. Discovered by accident when I was entranced by the look of Tonsai on my way to Railay (I asked the boat man to take me back to Tonsai once I’d seen it, please and thank you), I’ve returned and just love the chill vibe and beautiful surroundings. Tonsai is also an active place, full of kayakers, divers, rock climbers, fire dancers ,and slack-line walkers. It’s the perfect place to pick up a new skill, or to just laze around by the beach and read books. This was my favorite part of Vietnam because the locals flashed peace signs at me as I rode by on my motorbike, families watched fascinated and waved from their porches, and and old lady sat on my bike with me, stroked my face, and then rested for a while as we just sat there in relaxed silence. It was all quite strange and amazing. There’s really only one road through the town and not a whole lot of noise or business around. This makes for a really peaceful, agricultural, and naturally beautiful place. I definitely felt calm and in my natural element while at Phong Nha. — Those are my personal favorites, but there are an infinite number of chill places to find, no doubt, and what is chill is usually a bit undiscovered, so the chillness level does change often. Regardless, when I look back on my travels, these are the places I tended to enjoy the most and to find the most like-minded people. Coincidentally they are all naturally beautiful. What would you add to the list? I’m always on the hunt for the next peaceful, quiet, mellow destination.   Hi Kristin,First thanks for the list: after 7 years, I will be back in Southeast Asia in a few days for 4 months, and 2 of the places you list are actually on my list (never been there before): Phong Nha Ke Bang & Otres Beach. I was actually scared Otres Beach would be awfully touristy!In a completely different way, the last place I found really relaxing and inviting to slow down in Asia was Turtuk, in the Nubra Valley in Ladakh.CheersGilles It’s possible it has become more touristy since I was last there – in fact I’m sure it is. If you really want something more remote you can head to Rabbit island off of Kep in Cambodia. They didn’t actually have running water or even electricity when I was last there, so I’m guessing things may have upgraded slightly since then. Would love to hear your thoughts after you go to Otres! Thanks Kristin!I will let you know and of course write about it.I am concerned about the masses especially since I will be there over Xmas.CheersGilles Please add the name of each country. The name of each country is listed right next to the name of the city. Ella is in Sri Lanka, Pai is in Thailand, etc. Hoi An is very pretty. I’ve heard great things about Khao Sok! Otres Beach was definitely a highlight of my Asia trip. I met some awesome people there and we enjoyed low key days on the beautiful beach and then BBQ and (50 cent) beers after the sun set. Perfect. I also really liked Don Det and Pai so it seems like we have similar tastes. I’ll have to check out the rest the next time I’m in Asia. I think the beach BBQ I had on Otres was the best I’ve ever had. The meat was so good and we ate it all with our hands. I just love eating with my hands, to be perfectly honest. I would also add Chitwan in Nepal and also Battambang in Cambodia. Unbelievable laid back and peaceful for a small city! Thanks! I should check those out as I haven’t been to either one. “It just feels chill” – Ok, you couldn’t have said it better. Great suggestions and i love the photos (hanging out in Pai is my favourite). Haha, it’s a feeling, you know? Awesome! If you hit any of these I think you’ll be pleased with the vibes. These place are all really nice, but if you reaaaally want to chill out I’d say head to Central Asia! Like Khorog in Tajikistan, or Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. So laid back! So many people have suggested that lately and I’ve heard great things. They’re on the list now. Aahhh I am ALL about the chill places! Def adding these to my list for my RTW next year. Thank you! 🙂 Nothing better than a great chill place! It’s now my mission to visit as many of these places as I can on my trip to Asia next year. Thanks for sharing them! That’s awesome! Let me know how it goes please! Dali is the only place I really want to visit in China…met a couple who owns a hotel there and it just sounds magical There are so many other amazing places in China worth visiting as well, especially around Dali. Let me know if you ever make it out there! Khao Sok in Thailand was incredible.. I had to return a few months later! I will go back as well. I agree with Don det, so relaxed. Great post, gives me some ideas for the future Thanks for letting me know about Khao Sok. I want to check it out! Hi you should try Easter island its Amazing i sat at the higest point on the island, then it hit me there is No one higher than me for 3500km wow .. That’s very cool! Her Kristin,This is a real cool post. I liked it so much I reposted on my blogs facebook page 🙂 I thought I would have been to more but have only been to 3 places on this list! I think Tonsai Beach was my favourite chillest place thus far! A couple of cool chill places in India would be McLeod Ganj (gorgeous tibetan town in the foot of the Himalayas), Palolem Beach in Goa ($3 private beachfront cananas – yes please!) and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (go and stay in a castle for a few days eating amazing foods while watching the sun set from the roof of the castle). Have you been to any of these? Awesome, thank you! Thanks so much for giving me India tips! I am really looking forward to the time when I take off for an extended trip through there. Yes, Ella does sound very pretty and serene… And Pai? We’ve not heard of that before in Thailand. Another chill spot is Gili Air (one of the Gili islands off Lombok, Indonesia) – but don’t go to neighboring Gili T if you’re looking for “chill” as that’s quite a party island! We loved Koh Lanta in Thailand – found it very restful. But we hear a bridge is being built to connect it to Krabi, so rumour has it that the island may not stay so peaceful for long… I went to Gili T for a week right at the end of my first 10 months in SEA and have to say I really enjoyed it! I know it’s a party place but better for a solo traveler. I think Gili Air would have been awesome with a partner but my friend came back and said solo it was a little depressing.  You haven’t heard of Pai?! I’m obsessed with Pai! Go forth and visit! Thanks Kristin for exploring some best places of Asia through this post. Thanks for reading 🙂 Great post! I would love to check out Don Det, Laos. It seems like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. You’re website is pretty amazing. Hope my blog can be half as good as yours one day. That’s really kind of you, David! I would say you could be right assuming Don Det is like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. It’s still its own thing and its own place but both are worth checking out. Both are beautiful. Hi Kristin,I am headed to Southeast Asia in a few months but will only be able to stay for a little over a month. I am starting in Thailand and ending in Bali with a final night in Singapore. I am hoping to be efficient and get to see parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia as well. Any suggestions on how to make the most of your time while backpacking and ensure you get to see everything on your list? (Not your list specifically, just a list in general :-)) Any advice would be awesome!Thanks,Jordan You’re a bit limited with that timeframe and I’m sure you don’t want to burn yourself out with rapid movement, so I’d suggest seeing Angkor Wat in Cambodia, checking out an island such as Perhentian or Tioman in Malaysia, and exploring Hanoi and the surrounding areas in Vietnam, as those were the highlights for me and I bet you’d be pretty happy with those spots. So glad to hear it’s still good because I would like to return in May 🙂 Gah! I miss Pai so much and it was by far my favorite place in Thailand to visit. The hammocks, the sunsets, the night market, and the freakin’ food! I never made it to Tonsai but I’ll have to hit that next time I’m in Thailand. I feel like we are very alike in places we love to chill, so when I do finally get to Sri Lanka and China and the like, I’ll make it a point to check these out! we probably do have similar taste! Pai is always a wonderful place to be. I love your posts! And since I read the articles about Pai I just want to go there like immediately 🙂 in 2 weeks it is gonna be so far 🙂 Could you please share, where I can find this chill terrace from your Pai picture?  Wish you lots of fun on your further trips!! Thanks Maria! The photo is at the Container. OTRES BEACH brings back some serious ‘chill’ memories. Its amazing how its right down then way from the ‘main’ beach but its literally deserted.   Great choice! Glad to hear it’s still like that because I plan to return after 2.5 years away in May! Hi Kristin!I really enjoy your post, I ran into your blog for I will embark on my first solo trip in a couple months. I’ll be heading to Pai and I just love the picture you posted for Pai. Do you mind telling me the place. The one with the beautiful scenery and hanging chairs. Thanks It’s called the Container 🙂 HelloWhere in Pai is the photo with the swinging chairs taken? I’d love to go!K It’s called the Container, near Coffee in Love Hi, I will be travelling to southeast Asia in a couple weeks. Where are the hanging egg shaped seats in Pai? Thanks The Container Hello, is a great article. I hope sometimes i will visit Asia because is such a great place and i like their food Always wanted to visit Asia. And your post makes me want to make it happen more. Thank you! c”,) Indeed, Pai and the Land Split, are quite the Chill places! The snacks and beverages on those hammocks had me feeling like I was just floating on a cloud. I can still taste that yummy tamarind…mmmMMM. Hi Kristin! I’ll be back to Asia next year, and this is absolutely gold to include in my plans, thank you! I know you focus mainly in Southeast Asia, but if you ever decide to change destination, you could try Costa Rica 🙂 Puerto Viejo and Montezuma, even if are touristic places, have that chill vibe that make you question if you should leave everything to just live there! Thanks for the great post! I went through Costa Rica once for a week when I was in my early 20s and hit Belize the year after that for the same length of time. I’d love to move slowly through Central America the way I did through Southeast Asia. I’ve heard it’s a great place for slow travel as well Great post and I agree with otres being the best! I lived there for a while but do make sure you choose otres 2 not 1. kampot (a couple of hours) away is also amazing! Found some new gems from this for the next travels though. Great article.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/adams-peak-climb/,There May be no Sunrise on Earth like that of Adam’s Peak,Sri Lanka,"They had said it would be pretty.  They had said it would be a challenging climb.  They had said it held spiritual significance. They didn’t say it would be the most amazing sunrise view in all of Sri Lanka, or perhaps all of Asia, or dare I say, the world. Okay maybe not the world but it was definitely in my top 5. I have a thing for climbing and hiking, especially for a sunrise.  It’s what my family always did together and there’s nothing like the view at the top of a strenuous hike to provide the perfect reward for all that hard work – not to mention you can totally have chocolate milk after.  I mean you’ve earned it, amiright or amiright? Adam’s peak (or Sri Prada) is so-named because it is believed that Adam’s footprint rests at the top, if you ask a Musilm or Christian, that is.  If you ask a Buddhist, it is most certainly the Buddha’s footprint and if you ask a Hindu, it belongs to Shiva. Either way, it has become a significant pilgrimage place for several faiths, resulting in large numbers of locals making the 5,000-stair climb to the peak at 2,243 meters (7,359 feet) over 5 kilometers (3-ish miles) during the months of December to May along a well-lit path. I elected to go the week right before the pilgrimage season began, which ended up being the best idea ever. The pathways were not lit during this time, so I brought a headlamp along so as not to stumble and fall, which I am prone to do. During the peak pilgrimage season, hundreds if not thousands of people flock to Adam’s peak each day for the sunrise, making it a crowded climb.  When I went, there were about 50 people at the top, which is probably the max that the peak can comfortably accommodate. Hiking up with the stars, though, shutting off my headlamp every now and then and just sitting and admiring, not worrying about anyone else passing by and happily not missing out on the milky way that would be shut out by lighting, was perfect to me. I had read various forums saying that it would be unsafe to try the climb during the off-season, or that it was closed.  I’m happy to report this is untrue and I’d urge anyone who wants to try it, as long as it’s not raining (because that would make it quite unpleasant and muddy), to give it a shot. Yes, it’s a bit of a challenge to climb up 5,000 stairs, but it’s well worth it.  Even the red-faced couple I ran into about a half hour from the top, worried they wouldn’t make it, arrived in plenty of time to see the sunrise. And my, what a truly marvelous sunrise it was. The walk down, given all those stairs, was a challenge for the knees, but on the high of the sunrise, I barely felt it.  Once I was done with the steep stairs, I leaped, ran, and bounded the rest of the way down.  Total time was about 6 hours – 4 of which were spent climbing, 2 of which were spent waiting for and then admiring the sunrise. Do it yourself: I love having to work to see a sunset/sunrise – makes it so much better! It’s crazy being level with or over the clouds when the sun comes up…we saw the sunrise in Maui at 10k feet and it was awesome! Sri Lanka looks amazing! Me too. Makes it so much sweeter. Wow these photos are unbelievable! What an incredible experience Thanks 🙂 We missed Adam’s Peak when we visited Sri Lanka in 2010 (just went straight from Kandy to Ella – amazing train ride), but will definitely try to climb it if we ever return to that gorgeous island. Lovely post and great photos! Good luck and safe travels! Kandy and Ella are also great choices. This is one of my must-dos when I make it Sri Lanka.  Gorgeous photos! 🙂 Thank you and you definitely should! Nice shots, as usual. Thank you 🙂 *Picks jaw up off the floor* WOW that is for sure one of the most beautiful sunrises I’ve seen too. I’ve never hiked up a mount for a sunrise, but that is surely changing now. Lots of great places to do so in Southeast Asia! Glad to hear it! Let me know what you think of it when you go. This was easily my favorite moment from being in Sri Lanka, and your photos actually do it justice! While you were on the platform, did you have monks chanting in the background right before sunrise? I hiked up with a  Brit/Spanish couple, and all three of us agreed that it was this really beautiful magical thing. I’m happy to see this, though, as I feel like not many bloggers get to Sri Lanka. I didn’t watch it from the platform because the area just next to the stairs, just barely below it, is actually way better viewing and I had it to myself! Yea its hard to describe exactly where we were. From that bottom set of stairs of what would be properly considered the temple (but before you get to the main area where you can go up to the enclosure housing the ‘footprint’) you can sort of sneak off to the left and get to a little enclosed balcony type thing that looks back out over the east.  But, at any rate, glad you found somewhere amazing to watch it from! Wow that view and sunrise is just breathtaking. I’d LOVE to do that some day and just take a few moments to meditate while up there. It’s a highly spiritual place, so it’s a good selection for meditation 🙂 I’m planning my trip to Sri Lanka and even with 2 weeks I’m having to scale back my options. However Adam’s Peak has caught my imagination and trying my best to fit in. Is September a good time to climb? And once on the top can you see/view the footprint? You know, I honestly didn’t try to see a footprint because I was so entranced by the sunrise. I went in December and I would think September is also good. It’s best to go when it’s not pilgrimage season as it is so crowded at that time. Definitely won’t be the same but I read other posts about how crowded it gets at the top and decided it might be better to go in the off season, as long as you don’t get rain you should be good! Hiya,I’ve just read this post as I’m due to climb this in a few days’ time. I feel relieved, I’ll be doing it solo – am wondering if you felt safe doing the hike as a solo female? namaste!  wondering if its alright to do it solo ? 🙂 Yes I walked most of it on my own and you’ll see people along the way. I don’t know what I remember more… the mind-blowing sunrise or how bad my knees hurt climbing down ha ha! yeah I’d much rather climb up than down. Awesome, great posts. Appreciating all of your Sri Lankan posts, as I am going in March. Looking forward to reading your blog about other countries you have visited!! with your photos I’m gonna try to pitch Sri Lanka to my travel buddy instead of Vietnam 😀Love this, and hopefully my painfull knees would be able to survive 5 000 stairs, probably would need double the time to climb up 😀 Love, peace & pancakes from Croatia It’s all good going up! It’s the climbing down my knees always hate. I’m with you there! This looks so amazing. We are going to Sri Lanka in three weeks, and I realise that this will be during pilgrimage season- I understand that the crowd is just something that we wont be able  to avoid. We will be in Kandy and I hoep to squeeze this in. Do you think that if we organise a driver it is close enough from Kandy to just get picked up very early in the morning and start the hike? Thank you I would try to stay near the base of the mountain or you’re looking at a midnight pickup I’d guess Hi Kristin, your blog post has got me more excited to do this hike during my next trip to sri lanka. Since i will be travelling from Colombo, i was thinking of catching the last train to Hatton and then get a tuk tuk to Adam’s Peak base. The hike would roughly begin at about 2/3am, is it safe to do this hike during the off-season? But your write up did gave some courage to do this! I did it during the off season when the path wasn’t lit. You just need to bring a head lamp so that you can see! Hi Kristin, 5000 steps – 2-3 hrs uphill, so we require head lamps, water bottles and jacket as it gets cold at the top if we reach early, please advice if their is anything more to be added. I will be visiting Srilanka next month and the peak is on top of my list. Maybe bring a snack too 🙂 Hey Kristin, Your post is in opposition with all the reviews saying ‘do not climb off-season’. But after reading your post I think it worth it and is maybe even better than climbing it during the normal season. By any chance do you know if I can access to the peak from Ratnapura? Thanks 🙂 I’m not sure where I went from, but I liked my off season climb!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sri-lanka-unesco-sites/,A Visual Tour of Sri Lanka’s Cultural Triangle,Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka is full of UNESCO World Heritage sites, yet another pleasing surprise to learn about this wonderful country, given I hadn’t done much planning prior to my arrival. Polonnaruwa in Sri Lanka, the second oldest kingdom in Sri Lankan history, was my first real taste of the country and a fabulous introduction into its early history. Reminiscent of Sukhothai in Thailand, another ancient kingdom, I felt transported back in time while walking through the ruins on that boiling hot day right smack in the middle of Sri Lanka. Things this old always truly impress me, given I come from a country (and especially a state) where most of our buildings were erected just a few hundred years ago maximum. Then there was Sigiriya Rock, one of the most famous cultural icons that can be seen on much of Sri Lanka’s tourism posters and billboards.  Rising 200 meters out of the jungle, it was an impressive place to build an ancient kingdom. Occupied in the 400-500s CE, many parts of Sigiriya Rock are impressively well preserved, just as Polonnaruwa was: Do it yourself: Polonnaruwa: Sigiriya Rock * Special thanks to my travel buddy, Clement Marcelet, for sharing his photos with me after a bird, yes a bird, made off with my SD card. Been really enjoying your Sri Lanka posts as I’m thinking about adding it to my SEA trip.  I do have to admit the very last sentence was my favorite part…how, exactly, did the bird make off with the SD card? 😀 Birds love shiny things and they’re always stealing! Seriously! Also it’s my fault for leaving it out on the table in the middle of the jungle. I suppose I was asking for it. Wow, such beautiful pictures!! Are you still going to stay in Sri Lanka for a while or are you already heading somewhere else? P.S: Have you ever thought about coming to Brazil? ( and South America ) I actually left Sri Lanka December 15th and did a month in the Philippines following that.  Just arrived in Vietnam today! such a gorgeous place I REALLY want to visit Sri Lanka (as you know). These sites look absolutely incredible and I can only imagine what it was like to be there in real life and see them up close and not on a computer screen. I just wish that the cultural sites in SL didn’t have such horrific tourist pricing! They are horrifically expensive for tourists! That really frustrated me. hi kristin just stumbled upon your blog doing research for a sri lank tripgood work cheersdet Of all your posts up to this date, these photos were really awesome! Love the two monkeys and the guard Great blog!! Pics look amazing…I would like to suggest visit Darjeeling, it also has many temples and places to see. am sure you will have a great time there!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sri-lanka-elephants/,The Amazing Wild Elephants of Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka,"Call me crazy, but I really didn’t think of safaris when I thought of Sri Lanka. Well, to be honest, I had no idea whatsoever to think of when I thought of Sri Lanka.  It was the layover on my trip back from the Maldives so I just stayed and checked it out for a while. The end result was falling in love with an astoundingly gorgeous country with some of the more friendly people I’ve ever encountered. One of the most amazing things about this place is the endless jungle.  It stretches for miles and miles in every which direction, as far as the eye can see. Therein dwell all kinds of amazing creatures, the most exciting of which, for me, was the wild elephants. Now I’ve seen my fair share of elephants in Southeast Asia, but they’re always domesticated, and honestly, I feel terribly bad for them.  But these elephants are truly wild, roaming between various wildlife sanctuaries, just as elephants should do. Sri Lanka also boasts the largest density of elephants in Asia.  Despite this, they are still considered endangered as their population has been decreasing year after year due to a shrinking habitat. At first I figured they must have been brought there by early settlers, but the locals insisted to me that they are native, and bones have been found dating back several hundreds of thousands of years. The Sri Lankan elephant is one of three recognized subspecies of Asian elephants.  They happen to be the largest and the darkest of the Asian elephants, though still smaller than African elephants.  They reach a height of 8-10 feet at the shoulders and weigh up to 12 tons. Initially I thought that there must not be many males in the population, but later learned that only 7% of males actually grow tusks.  I wonder how mother nature chooses who the lucky ones are. The first time I saw the elephants was during a safari at Minneriya National Park near Dambulla in the cultural triangle. I intentionally went in with low expectations, hoping to see perhaps an elephant or two.  What I ended up seeing was at least two hundred elephants eating, mating, playing in the water, and generally doing elephant-y things. The second safari took place at Yala National park closer to the southern coastal stretch.  There were still tons of elephants but one thing that stood out was the variety of animals there, which seemed to be out in full force enjoying every moment of the day and every morsel of that beautiful beachside landscape. What really struck me, and one thing I’m not so sure is a positive, was how close we got to them in our jeeps.  I was of the opinion that elephants can charge at any moment, and that’s not a receiving blow I want to be on the end of. I can only guess that they’re so inundated with jeeps and people all the time, that though they may be wild, there’s an element of domestication there from the constant human proximity.  (That said, these were all shot with a telephoto lens. We were certainly not close enough to touch). Do it yourself: All said and done, I was so happy to finally see wild elephants after mainly only seeing captive elephants in Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. Those that are used for the amusement of tourists to ride on lead truly sad lives. Please, please don’t ever ride on elephants!   Do you love elephants? Have you seen them in the wild? Kristin these photos are incredible! I have a special place in my heart for Elephants, I am trying to make time to go to the Elephant Nature Park and from what I hear they are a responsible organization, glad to see that you agree. I’ll have to give a look into contributing. Cheers! Thank you Kylie 🙂Lots of my friends have reported a really great experience volunteering there. Great!Wonderful pictures! 🙂 Thank you! I’m so jealous right now! I have seen elephants in Asia, mainly in Thailand but as you said they were not wild and even if they live in parks where people don’t ride them and do other things to them, they are still not free as they would be in the wild. Thanks for sharing this amazing experience 🙂 It was good to see them just being wild elephants 🙂 I have no words for these photos. What a moment you must’ve had taking that photo of the big guy by the beach. The baby is too cute! I’ve never seen elephants anywhere other than a zoo but I do hope to participate in some sanctuary work (if I can find a humane one that does not involve riding one) when I go to Thailand in a few months. Gorgeous shots again! If you take  look at the end of the post I like one to Save the Elephants in Thailand. That would be a great choice as they take volunteers almost daily! they are so cute! They are! In a massive-gigantic-could-crush-me type of way. A beautifully written post with absolutely stunning pictures. Sri Lanka is now firmly on my list of places to visit! Thank you so much! And it should be! I loved it. Elephants certainly are majestic creatures. It’s lovely to see them in their natural habitat – society has taken away the magic of it with zoos, I think. I’ll definitely call into Sri Lanka in the future at some stage, I’ve got more destinations in mind than I know what to do with at the moment! You’ve really captured the essence of the place with your pictures, Kristin – especially the second one down, with the rainbow. Hats off to you, madame.  – Dan Haaaa love the elephants and cows! Great post xx Hi, Kristin!! My parents have always told my sisters and me that life is going to school, college, then you start working and get a family, but I’ve never felt like this life was for me. I got my first taste of traveling in Argentina ( lived there alone for 5 months) and then in France ( 9 months) but what really made me like more was the mini backpacking I did in Brussels/Brugge and Amsteram ( 6 days only, but I was 17 – 18 now- and not a lot of money, so I think it’s already something). I really want to backpack around the world like you do and your blog just made me want it more and more! I hope you continue traveling and doing what you like and also that one day it will be my turn 🙂 Be safe! Thank you for the kind words Leo! I think it’s only natural for our parents to want us to have stable lives, and the idea of traveling long term can be scary for them. That said, if you love it then you have to do it. Best of luck to you! Gorgeous photos Kristin!  I love the rainbow one… looks like the header on my website! 🙂 x Thanks Helen! Great photos, and a great cause. Was at an elephant park in South Africa once and was truly incredible,  Sri Lanka looks great too! I’d love to see African elephants! I have also been on the half day safari at Minneriya National Park. Though it it wasn’t recent but in 2003 I can say that it all is one of my most unforgetable and exhilerating tours I have ever been on. You mentioned about the elephants being somewhat domesticated. I can assure you that in 2003 that one of the small herds we were able to observe was completely wild, remembering I was there in 2003. Our driver did everything he could to keep safe distance, but at one point a calf came out of the bush about 50 m behind our jeep, momma came out close behind. Seeing us so close she trumpeted turned and charged. Our driver was quick to get the jeep moving but when you are watching a mad momma elephant in full run comming toward you will wish you were in a faster vehicle. After about a half a minute of bravely fleeing for our lives with video camera running but catching very little because your just kinda pointing and not properly aiming. I can tell you that’s one female elephant that was wild. We had a wonderful time. Thank you for your article and bringing back special memories of an outstanding vacation in Sri Lanka Hi Keith, yes they are definitely wild, I just felt that maybe we got a bit too close and should have respected their space a bit more. Was a real highlight for me, too, and completely unexpected. Sri Lanka was a wonderful place and I hold special memories of it as well! Hi. Kristin, I am a Sri Lankan lived most of my life away from the country. Coming back to Sri Lanka , I realize the enormous potential of Holiday travel industry and started inbound travel operation company.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/train-travel-sri-lanka/,Take the Train in Sri Lanka: The Absolute Best Way to Travel,Sri Lanka,"You can find me sitting in the doorway of the second class, open-air train in the heart of Sri Lanka as it winds through the tea plantations, waterfalls, running brooks, and misty clouds, between mountains dotted with trees and bright purple flowers. I’ll be smiling to myself about how I just got the steal of the century, spending the equivalent of a dollar or two on a train that is taking me through some of the hands-down most beautiful country I’ve ever seen. I know I say that about just about everywhere, but as a kind Vietnamese girl named Cherry once told me, “I think everywhere has its own special beauty.” I think she’s right. I’m surrounded by extremely friendly, smiley people who wave and ask where I’m from.  I can’t believe how much I’m loving this little trip that for most of these people is standard procedure. Little kids stick their heads out and, when the train comes to a stop and we can hear each other, ask me what my name is. “It’s Kristin!” “Rajvi?” “Kristin!” “Rajvi?” “…Yes, Rajvi.” I feel myself smiling like a crazy person, at nothing in particular, other than the feel of the air through my hair and the low-hanging mist cooling off the day.  I can’t imagine a more perfect moment exists than this.  Every moment is savored in this magical green oasis. Peace was only reached in Sri Lanka three years ago. Perhaps it would have been unsafe to take this route prior to then, or especially some of the other parts I had visited in the cultural triangle farther north.  Everyone I speak to agrees it’s good that peace has been reached – they’re glad the fighting is over. It’s hard to imagine everyone here older than three years old knows what constant fear feels like.  They know what it really means to value every moment of being alive.  They don’t take it for granted. Now I’m hanging out the door, on what feels like the edge of the world.  Both hands are gripping the side bars as I lean out, ducking back in every time a low-hanging branch or grasses that are a little too tall threaten to clip me.  People in the rice paddies and tea farms wave as we pass by.  The kid who dubbed me Rajvi and I smile and laugh whenever we catch each other’s eye. Then it’s time to give someone else a turn.  I don’t want to be a door hog. In how many places that you can think of do people prefer the open doorway and the floor next to it to a nice comfortable seat? Not many that I can think of.  No matter, the window is completely open and I can hang out of it, the music in my ears playing a peaceful soundtrack to what I’m seeing, which is pure bliss, pure beauty. It was due to happenstance that I ended up in Sri Lanka. My layover from the Maldives brought me and I elected to stay. Who would have thought it would bring me such joy and adventure? Do it yourself: Sri Lanka has been on my list forever! Your photos are so beautiful, how long ago were you there? Happy New Year! I was there end of November to mid-December 🙂 so beautious! What a beautiful post Rajvi 😉Sri Lanka looks fabulous. Thank you and it is! Wow! This really is something! Something so cool, yet so cheap! Double win! I may be a little biased, but train really is the way to go. 🙂 It really is. The busses were so crowded but the trains were such a delight. Sri Lanka is going to be on my list, so I’m going to make this one a priority. 🙂 Definitely worth an addition to the list! It is! Enjoy. It was concentrated in the north, so if she was down south she probably didn’t feel it much. Looks gorgeous. I’ve heard such great things about Sri Lanka recently – now I really want to go there! Love this post, Kristin! Sri Lanka is at the very top of my list of countries I want to visit, and I’ve been craving an epic train journey. There is something about train travel that relaxes and inspires in a way that other modes of transportation really don’t. It’s such a nice way to see how the locals live and travel. Sri Lanka looks so beautiful. I REALLY hope that Tony & I make it there this year! Wow Sri Lanka looks so lush and beautiful. I really love train journeys like this! I recently took the ‘toy train’ to Shimla in Northern India and that was a great experience. Sri Lanka has been on my wish list for a while now, I may just have to bump it up to the top. Great post! I traveled around Sri Lanka by train a few years ago and loved it! Beautiful pictures! Sounds like a lovely way to see Sri Lanka. Thank you and it is! Hey, nice pictures!Just curious, have u travelled to India?If u haven’t, I think its time you did! I haven’t but I’m thinking of doing so next year! Enjoyed this post and your photos! My husband and I are headed to Sri Lanka in just three weeks, and are looking forward to riding the rails through tea country. Did you happen to take the train from Ella to/from Badulla? From Ella all the way through to Colombo. It was brilliant. From Badulla to Ella I was in a car. Yep, that train ride from Kandy to Ella was one of the highlights of our travels. Great photos, congrats! Good luck! WoW! Blog sounds cool. Blog photos is excellent too. Please share more photos with us like it. Thanks a …….. LOT. Heading to Ella this weekend, any recommends on places to stay and things to do? You can do some hikes around there – mini Adam’s peak! I love your pictures!!I’m going to Sri Lanka in late December and I’m very happy!! 🙂 You’re sure to love it! I was there in early December and it was great I turned up 15 minutes before the train left the station and bought my 2nd class ticket. I believe you need to go in person and get the first class tickets if that’s what you want to ride in. You can probably contact a local travel agency to sort that out for you. Hi Kristin.I love your blog…thank you!I really want to go to Sri Lanka but have read it’s not a great place for solo female travelers. That is the way I prefer to travel but might be able to find a buddy if needed. Do you think it’s okay to go alone? Did you find any trouble at all?Thank you, Lisa Why and where did you read that? I didn’t have issues anywhere but once in Nepal during my solo travels but I can’t, of course, guarantee that it’s fine. I thought it was great, though! We’re busy planning our trip to Sri Lanka. We’re wanting to experience as much as possible but on a budget. Train travel was a consideration, but now I’ve read you’re post, it’s a definite! Lorna | eatmyyythoughts.com Great post..! Really loved it.. Thanks for sharing these stunning pictures. But to a have a comfortable train ride.. you should book your tickets one month prior to your visit… Nah, just show up and book. It’s not India Loved the post – especially the pictures. Just stunning! We did the Ella to Kandy journey last month. Even on a drizzly day through the mountains, the scnery was breathtaking. Do you remember the tunnel screaming?! Sri Lanka is one of my favorite places. I did the train also when I traveled there. Picturesque and most beautiful scenery.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-best-myanmar-itinerary/,The Best of Myanmar: The Full Itinerary,Myanmar,"This post was originally written by Ryan Brun for BMTM in 2014. While much of what he wrote is still true and remains in this post, I visited again in 2020 and have updated the post as well as added in new resources and spots to see. Enjoy! -Kristin Myanmar isn’t a Southeast Asian country that is often on travelers “must see” lists, or planned for their great backpacking adventure. Which is a shame, because Myanmar is one of the most culturally preserved and exciting destinations in Asia. Why isn’t Myanmar on everyone’s “must do” lists? It honestly wasn’t on my list until I was invited by a friend. Before traveling to Myanmar, I didn’t know anything about the country except about how it was closed off from the world up until about a couple decades ago. After backpacking through a large portion of Myanmar during their annual Thingyan Festival, I can without a doubt declare Myanmar as my favorite country in Southeast Asia. Myanmar is a captivating and exciting country for many reasons. From floating villages, to valleys of ancient temples that beat out Angkor Wat, to multi-day jungle treks into mountain tea picking villages. Ready to go yet? Awesome. Here’s my itinerary on the best of Myanmar, from where to go to what to do from my own personal experiences, and a few key tips and tricks to know before you go: Yangon (former capital city of Rangoon) is the highest populated city in Myanmar, and most likely where you will arrive. It’s the country’s bustling economic capital filled with colonial-era buildings mashed up against modern high-rises and Buddhist temples. On arrival, Yangon can feel just as overwhelming as a city like Bangkok or Jakarta, but take a deep breath, settle into a hotel, and go for a wander. Here in Yangon you’ll get to experience the everyday lives of Burmese (people of Myanmar) who are usually too busy to try and surround you with goods to sell, but are happy to flash a smile. Explore the old and new of a fast growing city, and enjoy Yangon’s endless opportunity for street photographers. Stay: Hotel Shwe Yee is perfectly situated walking distance from Shwedagon Pagoda and has great breakfast! Most of the accommodation will be centered around the market streets and Chinatown area, and this is a great place to eat for your first night as you take everything in. 19th and 20th Street are the hotspots, and though it can be crowded and a bit funky smelling, there are plenty of restaurants to have a big meal with ample people watching. Shwedagon Pagoda is the most sacred temple in all of Myanmar, and a popular pilgrimage for Buddhists. Legend has it that this golden pagoda and complex was built more than 2,500 years ago, which theoretically would make it the oldest Buddhist temple in the world. I love walking through markets – you can get a real sense of life in a country there. Especially when nobody bothers you! These sprawling, ornate ironwork markets date back to British rule almost 100 years ago and will be a good escape from the heat as well as the best place to buy clothes, bags, and other trinkets if you need anything. Bonus, the vendors don’t chase you down like many other markets. Quick Tips: Eat eat eat! Yangon will have the most diverse selection of food in Myanmar. Book accommodation ahead of arrival, hostels and hotels fill up fast, especially during holidays. Yangon will be the best place to get toiletries and supplies so stock up. Get a SIM card here if you want one (they are easy to find, and the airport has reasonable prices.) East of Yangon is one of the top three most important Buddhist pilgrimage sites in Myanmar. Kyaiktiyo Pagoda is a massive golden rock barely balancing on the edge of an 1,100 meter tall mountain with breathtaking panoramic views of the jungle valley (and a heart-pounding ride to the top). To get to the pagoda, you’ll need to head out early in the morning and take a bus to Kinpun village. From there you will be packed into the back of a truck with monks and Burmese locals. If you feel up for the challenge, you can hike the entire way to the top from the village which will be a 5+ hour trek through jungle and mountainous terrain, but it’ll be the ultimate way to experience the pilgrimage. Once at the top, buy a golden leaf and stick it onto the boulder (only men are allowed to do that)…just don’t be the one who finally pushes it over the edge! Note from Kristin: Women are not permitted to touch the rock but are permitted in the outer courtyard. I don’t even have to tell you how I feel about that! Stay: This hotel is 30 minutes away from the Kyaiktiyo Pagoda. There are also a few hotels located at the foot of the pagoda that are a lot more expensive. Inle was one of the most beautiful towns I visited in Myanmar, which is hard to choose because many are. But, let’s just say, it was the most lush. About 9-10 hours north of Yangon by bus sits Inle Lake, a sprawling and beautiful natural contrast to Yangon tucked into a valley surrounded by green hills. It is a network of canals, irrigation waterways, farms, and a giant freshwater lake. It’s a perfect escape after experiencing the bustling city life of Yangon. Once in Inle Lake, the most known attraction is the floating villages. It is essentially a neighborhood on stilts, where locals live in huts built above a network of marsh and grass waterways. Take a boat and see what life is like living on the water and relying off of food farmed in the grassland or fished. The scenery itself is beautiful, and it’s relaxing sitting in the canoe cruising through the maze of houses watching children climb from one house to the next to wave you along. About an hour and 45 minutes from Inle, you’ll find the pagoda forest of Kakku. Though it’s a long drive, I found that it was totally worth it to get away from the tourist center of Inle and enjoy this gorgeous temple complex almost all to myself. More on how to get there and avoid the crowds here. If you’re trekking and outdoor inclined like myself, hit Kalaw first and do the 3-day trek to Inle Lake that takes you through valleys and small villages where you’ll stay each night, experiencing rural Myanmar life. The cost is low, the views are spectacular, and the trek is life-changing. No hot showers, no electricity, no internet, just pure experiences with the nicest people on earth? Sign me up! Quick Tips: Inle Lake is one of the more popular destinations so it’s good to book accommodation ahead. Just outside of the town limits, there is a vineyard and winery that’s worth a visit after a bicycle ride around the country roads. Stay: Inle Cottage Boutique Hotel is an amazing value for the money, and the staff is so nice! Bagan was one of my favorite experiences during my time exploring the country. Whether you hit Bagan before or after Inle Lake, it is still a must see when visiting Myanmar. Considered the Angkor Wat of Myanmar (but I think it’s better), Bagan is a UNESCO World Heritage site and valley of more than 2,000+ ancient temples built between the 9th and 13th centuries, which included the golden era of Burma in the 11-12th century time period. During the summer months while I was there, the valley is arid and covered in rust-colored red sand, but in the monsoon season becomes a vibrant green jungle climate. At times, we were surrounded by hundreds at the largest temples, and at other times, completely alone to crouch and crawl through narrow passages of empty temples. Rent a scooter or bicycle and cruise around to some of the 2000+ temples around Bagan – but there’s no way you’ll see them all! Get adventurous and go down some of the dirt roads to the smaller temples where you’ll find yourself alone to explore, living out your Indiana Jones or Lara Croft fantasies. Scooters can be rented for $5-$10 a day and will make it much easier than bicycles to explore. Quick Tip: From late 2019 it’s no longer possible to climb any of the temples or pagodas for a sunrise or sunset overview. For the best places to catch sunrise and sunset these days, check out this post by Kristin. Now that the temples are closed, what’s the best way to get that awesome overview? Jump in the hot air balloons! Just before sunrise you can take a ride up in a hot air balloon and see the entire valley change from purple to gold with ancient temples as far as the eye can see silhouetted against the horizon. The cheapest and best-reviewed ride we’ve found can be booked here. Stay: You can get amazing balloon sunrise and sunset views at the Aureum Palace Hotel, though it’s a pretty penny. To stay right in the heart of Old Bagan, I loved the Hotel @ Tharabar Gate. In central Myanmar, Mandalay is the second largest city in the country, and a good place to launch from for almost all activities and destinations. From Mandalay, you’ll be able to reach Inle Lake, Bagan, and Hsipaw in the far north. Since it’s another large metropolis, Mandalay will have plenty of delicious places to eat and a decent nightlife scene, with a couple swanky bars overlooking the river. I’m sure you’ve seen the photos of silhouetted monks walking across a long bridge with a fiery orange sunrise. That, my friends, is U Bein Bridge. By far one of the best sunrises I’ve ever experienced (and I think it will be for you as well), U Bein Bridge is the world’s oldest and longest teak wood bridge. I would have stayed there all day, but by 9am, it was swarmed with people, so make sure to arrive early! Just before sunrise, the monks follow the call to prayer and all walk across in their crimson robes to the temple across the river. Get ready to break a sweat. I was panting by the time we reached the top, but it’s worth the long walk up to Mandalay Hill to the temple perched at the top for an incredible view at sunset (and one helluva stair climb).  In the city center and surrounded by a large moat, Mandalay Fort is worth checking out. Mandalay has an abundance of stunning temples, pagodas, and stupas to check out in and around the city. Check out the ancient capital, the amazing Hsinbyume Pagoda, and more. The best way to see it all is by car. You can find out more here. Stay: Hotel Yadanarbon was in a great location, has a rooftop pool, and an amazing breakfast! Oh Hsipaw, how I miss those days. Mountains all around, trees that grow out of temples, lush farmland, waterfalls, and the best tea you’ll ever have — sound good? Hsipaw is the main township of the Shan State, and is located 200km northeast of Mandalay, perfect for anyone needing an escape into the outdoors. This will be the main destination for anyone wanting to do some serious multi-day trekking and to explore more untouched Myanmar in remote mountain villages. We rented bicycles while in Hsipaw and explored for a couple of days. Though it can become quite hilly and rugged outside of town, every road you go down will have something fascinating to see. Don’t miss the ancient temple complex and check out the stupa that has a tree growing out of it. Watch young monks play games, wander the vibrant fruit and vegetable markets, and relax by the river. For someone who is obsessed with train travel, I had to do what is said to be one of the greatest train journeys in the world. This, above most else, should be on your list of must-do’s in Myanmar. Along the 12 hour journey, you’ll also cross the Goteik Viaduct, considered a world masterpiece in engineering and at one time the world’s longest viaduct bridge at 2,260 ft long (and currently the highest in Myanmar at 335 feet!). The old train to Hsipaw is a clunking and captivating journey that leaves Mandalay before dawn and takes you up mountains by zig-zagging its way forward and backwards, then down into lush valleys of rice and soy fields. Over 100 years old, it’s a technological marvel of its time period, and the coolest mode of transport to get to Hsipaw. Quick Tips: Purchase tickets at the train station days before, and try to get first class seats for 2,000 kyat ($2.00). We could only get second class seats, and 12 hours on wooden benches is doable but brutal. Hiking in the countryside was one of the best excursions we did in Myanmar. On the 2-3 day trek you’ll meet rural farmers, tea pickers, and even rebel soldiers who are happy that you are experiencing their small world and sharing their everyday life. Don’t worry, even the soldiers were the nicest people I’ve ever met. Plus, the tea leaves there are said to help with longevity in life, so drink away! We stayed in a small traditional hut and ate home cooked meals with a local family, and I drank some rice wine with soldiers (shhhh). Our guide, Ax Sai, was extremely knowledgeable, spoke English very well, and even took us to some secret waterfalls after a scorching day of trekking. Quick Tips: Wear a hat, sunscreen, and bring extra bottles of water and snacks. And proper shoes! Pack things like peanuts or apples that won’t go bad in the heat. Look for Ax Sai, he’s awesome. Myanmar has a beautiful coastline with white sand beaches and beautiful sunsets. As an added bonus, there are no buckets, all-night parties, nor fire dancers, which kill the peaceful ocean vibe for me! Ngapali is one of the loveliest beaches, though there are many down south worth checking out. You can read more about Ngapali here. Thingyan Festival, or the New Year celebration for Myanmar, will most likely be one of the craziest experiences of your life. Thingyan is Myanmar’s biggest holiday and a Buddhist celebration for the purpose of washing the previous year’s sins away and beginning the new year with a clean spirit. With millions of gallons of water. From my experience at Thingyan, it lasted the full week and there was no escaping the chaos. It’s fun, but it’s also exhausting, and after a few days you’ll probably lock yourself inside. Luckily I had goggles after taking on the Rickshaw Run in India to protect me from the blasts to my face. Quick Tips: Book accommodation and transport WAY in advance – everything sells out. Get a waterproof bag for money and phones. Don’t carry your DSLR, it’ll get destroyed. Remember, it’s their holiday and there is no escaping it, so have fun and don’t get mad. Bring goggles, they are a life saver (especially from eye infections). And buy the biggest damn water blaster you can find! Before Myanmar relaxed its tourism policies, getting visas for the country, let alone most everything else, could be a huge hassle. SIM cards used to be thousands of dollars, banks were scarce, and much more of the country was closed off to travel. Luckily it’s become much easier now to travel to. I found it actually easier than a lot of other countries I’ve visited. eVisa: For your Myanmar visa you’ll want to apply for the eVisa, which takes a couple of days to process, and after approval, you will receive a government issued letter to print and show on arrival. There are only a few countries that don’t need to do this, but if you’re from the USA, be sure to apply for one and double check that all of the information is correct. I found out the hard way that being even one day off on your passport expiry date can mean being denied boarding for your international flight. Buses: This was how Ryan mainly traveled through Myanmar. There are fancy VIP buses that are cheap and much comfier than much of Southeast Asia, with reclining seats, blankets, and snacks offered. Now that there is a main highway that runs from Yangon all the way to Mandalay, the road north isn’t too dicey. Train: I only got to ride the train in Myanmar once, but it was my favorite way to travel. Train travel is another good option and can be taken from Yangon all the way north to Hsipaw with transfers. My recommendation from experience is to book a 1st class ticket on the train which won’t be much more expensive, and it’ll save your back and bum from a lot of pain. I know from experience. Private Taxi: During our time in Myanmar, we mainly took buses when we could find them, but occasionally had to hire a private taxi to drive us to the next destination because nothing else was available. These drivers have nice cars with air-conditioning, but can be quite the speed demons even on roads with sheer cliffs dropping off the side. Our driver had to stop to hose off the breaks because they were smoking. A private taxi will run around $40-$65 for a full day drive to another city. Flights: Much of Myanmar is accessible via air travel these days, particularly for Mandalay, Yangon, Bagan, Inle, and Ngapali. I flew Air KBZ and thought it was great. Myanmar isn’t quite the wild east of Asia anymore because the country’s relaxed tourism policies are spurring growth, but it was one of the most authentic cultural experiences I’ve had. Getting around Myanmar is much easier than it was even 3 years ago, and if you prepare before arriving by having visas and accommodation sorted, you won’t run into many hiccups. With infrastructure improvements, WiFi and 3G/4G available almost everywhere, and banks in every town, there’s not much difficulty in getting around. But I can’t forget the best part. The most memorable aspects of Myanmar are the people. Always smiling, displaying unending generosity, and not once did I feel I was trying to be scammed from every direction. This, combined with the culture and fascinating places to visit, made it my favorite destination in Southeast Asia. And it’s bound to become your favorite as well.

I like to take my time, so wondering if a month is enough or if I should plan for longer! 🙂 I stayed for 10 days, much of it was soaked by Thingyan water festival. A month would allow you to immerse yourself in the culture, and pick a spot you’d love to spend most of your time in! Thanks for the post Ryan!!I’m currently travelling around SEA and I wasn’t sure about going to Myanmar but after speaking with others I have definitely been swayed into visiting. I love catching trains too so I’ll be sure to check the train to Hsipaw out. Thank you for all the info. Hello Steph! Glad I could sway you into traveling through Myanmar. Did you ever make it through the country? And did you take trains for most of it? Great information! Myanmar hasn’t really been on my radar, I guess that cause exactly like it says in the article, it’s a bit more off the path than Thailand, Laos, etc. But typically those turn out to be the best places 🙂 Happy to give you the information you need Ijana, hopefully you get out to Myanmar and tell us all about it! Definitely off the beaten path but that’s exactly what I love about it too! Love the information provided by you. As I didn’t know about Myanmar. But after your article I am going to add into my bucket list. Great Writing Skills. Cheers!Thanks! Thank you Nitin for the compliment, and I hope you have added it to your bucket list for sure. Make sure to tell us when you go! I’m a Filipino and have always admired south east asian countries, from their mountains to their highlands, from cities – urban and rural – to provinces, Myanmar is definitely a place to go to. I couldn’t describe it any better than you do. Really appreciate it. Thank you so much for sharing this! Makes me wanna go back to them good old days. I’ve heard there is PLENTY to see in the Philippines though, and I’m aching to go and trek the jungles. Happy you liked the article and shared your thoughts! Maybe you should revisit your travels there sometime? Hi, i would like to know how much did you spend approximately per day? Thank you in advance,  MM I have a few friends who have been to Myanmar and loved it. It’s definitely on my to do list.I love the pictures you took. Really captures its beauty Ikam Acosta Where did your friends visit in Myanmar Ikam? You have to at some point, it’s already on my list to revisit! Thank you for the compliment about the photos I really appreciate that. Myanmar is on our RTW trip in November and we can’t wait to discover its temples and landscapes. We don’t know yet if we are going to see it from north to south or the other way but thanks for all those advices. It will definitely help us crafting our road map. Take care. David & Kro. Hey David and Kro, looks like November is here! Have you planned out your trip to Myanmar yet? i personally loved the north but all of it was incredible. Excited to see where it takes you! Bagan is amazing! I agree it’s best to explore the pagodas and temples on two wheels. It’s faster that way plus you can discover other temples that are at par with popular ones. We were there around May, and it was raining most of the time. We also missed the hot air balloons, but we’re lucky enough to catch the sunrise and sunset. Ahh well if it was rainy season then you had the chance to see it in full bloom? I’ve been dreaming of visiting while the valley is lush and green! Hello Jade, apologies for the delayed reply! You absolutely must get over there now, my favorite Southeast Asia country. I’d say 7-10 days would be ideal to see most of these sights and destinations while being able to properly take it in. Oh..I’m happy to see you wrote about Myanmar, which is my native land!!!There are many other amazing and interesting places to visit like Chin State hiking and Virgin Islands of Mergue!!!Please visit again to my native land for further visits.I’ll definitely take you there!!Warmly welcome from MyanmarXoxo <3 Hello Veronica, I may just have to take you up on that offer because I want to return to Myanmar next year. The Chin State hiking sounds wonderful, and I want to do much more hiking next year! Sometimes people view Myanmar as an off the beaten path country.  Sure its emerging, but still in comparison to SE Asian neighbors, much of it is still to be explored, keeping off the beaten path because of decades of civil war.  I live in a fringe area, trying to create opportunity further out, because even though Bagan & Inle are great, some of the most beautiful and untouched areas still are largely undiscovered.  Like Lashio, the city beyond Hsipaw, which is great for trekking, but Lashio has some of, if not the best waterfall experiences in SE Asia, but nobody knows about it.  Thanks for sharing your experience.   I have a social enterprise adventure guide company called Myanmar Adventure Outfitters, and with recent moronic moves by Myanmar’s government, many locals who are gaining new opportunities through tourism could see those opportunities fade, so please read Ryan’s article, keep coming, because the people you may want to hurt by boycotting this country are not the ones who will hurt, its the average locals. Spent a month in Myanmar back in 2014 and absolutely loved it – so much to see there…Sadly, areas near Hsipaw were closed due to Shan Rebels and government troops fierce fighting. I’m glad this amazing country is getting the recognition it deserves! I spent nearly 1 month in Myanmar back in 2013 and have been itching to get back since.  Bagan is absolutely incredible and so much fun (Angkor Wat in Cambodia paled in comparison to Bagan for me). It was so much fun jumping on a electric bike every day and exploring. But my absolute favourite thing was that at the smaller temples you had to find the ‘key holder’ who would unlock the temple and maybe show you a secret staircase to climb to the top for amazing views. Indiana Jones eat your heart out! Great list of the must-see highlights for your first trip to Myanmar. I loved Myanmar when the first time I came here. A nature place without many building or useless stuffs.  I’m planning to visit Myanmar again in 2020, can’t wait for it. If anyone want to join me, please let me know as well! Great that you put Bagan in your itinerary. Some important thing to note is “Temple climbing is now banned at Bagan”.  Thanks for a great article.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ngapali-beach-myanmar/,Ngapali Beach: The Perfect Guide to Myanmar’s Dreamy Coastal Town,Myanmar,"As the sun takes a dip into the ocean to finish the day, our shadows long behind us and the light beams turning gold through the coconut trees, I thank Myanmar for another peaceful day spent alternating between the ocean and the umbrella. It’s perfectly lazy. It’s everything I want.  I have a thing for coastal towns like this in Southeast Asia. It reminds me in some ways of Otres Beach in Cambodia years ago, but perhaps with fewer joints being passed around.  Or maybe it’s more like Tonsai in Thailand used to be, or a bit like Koh Yao Yai  and Koh Yao Noi. I’m always on the hunt for the beautiful places in Southeast Asia that aren’t overrun yet, and this crescent-shaped beach above Ngapali is straddling the line, at least for now.  The water is perfectly clear, straight down to the white sand. Unlike much of Southeast Asia where it’s a toss-up whether the water is more or less refreshing than just sweating it out on the beach, this little part of the Bay of Bengal is much cooler.  It’s the kind of water temp you have to run into and let your body get used to, but it’s perfect for cooling off.  It’s also amazing for sunsets.  You’d have to swim out quite far to see any corals or very many fish, but with fins and a mask it’s possible. It’s also only about 35,000 kyat, or $24, to take a boat out for the day instead. And that might have been a fine thing to do, but I just felt like being lazy. There are also pagodas nearby that you can take an e-bike to, and just like in Bagan, you can hot air balloon over Ngapali in the early AM to watch the sunrise illuminate it.  There’s also the actual Ngapali beachfront, which is a bike ride south requiring 5-25 minutes, depending on how far down you’d like to go. Between the two, I much preferred this nameless little cove right above it, without as many commercial activities and people selling things.  Want to find this little slice of perfection? Here’s what I did: Stay at Yoma Cherry Lodge. There are also a few cheaper hostels nearby. Yoma will keep you off of the main area where the resorts are located. There’s nothing wrong with this part of the beach, but it’s more built up and crowded. I also liked that Yoma is plastic-free. They will pick you up from the airport as well! Eat at Sandy Beach Traditional Seafood, right next to Yoma Cherry Lodge. The seafood is amazing, and out of all the food I ate in Myanmar, it was my favorite. I also appreciated that the owner took an injured puppy under his care when he realized nobody else was looking after him.  Coconut Beach  to the right of Yoma is also really good, with very friendly owners. Bring your own straws to both places.  Enjoy this little slice of paradise, and let’s keep this secret cove between us.  *Some links in this post are affiliate links, which support this site at no extra cost to you. I appreciate you!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mandalay-myanmar-things-to-do/,24 Hours in Mandalay: The Best Things to Do in 2020,Myanmar,"If you’ve been dreaming of white temples and friendly locals, a bustling city, that for most, is a portal to Bagan, then you must be envisioning Mandalay. I liked Mandalay. My expectations were low after reading online reviews where people called the city chaotic and busy, but I came out loving it. And while I can see where they’re coming from, there’s something about that chaos that reminds me of adventures in my 20s and ignites my soul.  With a short 24 hours in the city, this is how I made the most of it and did the best there is to do in and around Mandalay: I learned about this famous bridge after seeing its photo on momondo while looking up flights. Hey, a girl’s got to get her inspiration wherever she can. It was a sight to behold.  The bridge is a whopping 1.2km long and is believed to be the longest  and oldest teak bridge in the world, constructed in 1850. While this bridge is famous for its sunset, I am honestly not sure why,  because the sunrise is more optimal, IMHO. You get the beautiful sun rising right in front of you while you admire the monks, and tourists, walking across the bridge into the bright, orbital sun. Plus, it’s much less crowded if you go at sunrise. Leave downtown Mandalay by 5:30am to get there in time.  Mandalay is pagoda central (that goes for all of Myanmar, really), and during your day of exploration that’s most of what you’ll see. Prepare by wearing something that covers your shoulders and knees and pick shoes you don’t care much about, because you’ll be putting dirty feet back into them – no shoes are allowed in the pagodas. Kuthodaw is characterized by a large central, golden stupa and rows upon rows of white pagodas that house the world’s largest book. In each pagoda you’ll see inscriptions on large stone slabs in seemingly endless rows. It’s a photographer’s dream, as was everything on my whirlwind tour. *This is not the only pagoda worth seeing in town, and there’s also the palace, but keep in mind that traffic is BAD in Mandalay and can eat up a lot of your time, plus much of the amazing pagodas are outside of it.  This ancient imperial capital from the 14th to 19th centuries is quite different from anything else I saw in Myanmar, and I loved that it’s open to walk through and on, unlike Bagan these days.  I was surprised to find that it wasn’t crazy crowded, and loved the locals wanting to take pictures together. The Burmese are such a welcoming, friendly people, and their ancient rulers had some wicked style. There are several stupas in the area that are closer in style to what you’ll see in Bagan, as well as an old wooden monastery that’s more or less falling apart, which made it all the more intriguing and ancient-feeling to me.  There’s a 10,000 kyat entrance fee, plus 1000 for the boat that takes you across to the ruins and back. Once you’re there, getting around is limited to just horse-drawn carriages for 15,000 kyat. I hated doing anything involving a horse, but given it’s 10km around the area to see all of the things, it’s not something you can do on foot unless you spend all day there. Unfortunately there are no tuk-tuks or other options at the time of this writing. Alternatively, only go to the old palace and skip the rest.  It’s also worth noting that the touts there are some of the most aggressive I’ve experienced. If you show interest they will get on a bike and follow you around until you buy something. I’m not hating on the hustle, and I did buy things because I liked what they were selling, but stay strong and don’t feign interest if you’re not into it! Next I made my way up and around to the 30 Caves Pagoda, aka Goldmember’s dream. Each gold-framed doorway leads to a Buddha statue inside, and the whole area has a beautiful view.  We also stopped at another viewpoint nearby with a sweeping view of the stupa-lined horizon and leading all the way to central Mandalay. All of it was free, save for a 300 kyat camera fee. Is this real life? The Hsinbyume Pagoda is unlike any other religious site in the world, and it’s open to explore, walk on, and enjoy. It was built in the early 1800s based on descriptions of the mythical Sulamani Pagoda on Mount Meru. Concentric terraces, totaling seven, represent an equal number of mountains leading up to and surrounding Meru, according to Buddhist mythology, and even if you’re not the spiritual type, you may find yourself starting to believe while exploring Hsinbyume. Most people get here by taking a boat from Mandalay’s city center, or stop here in the early morning, because frankly it makes a lot more logistical sense to head there after U Bien. However I knew I wanted to be there for golden hour and sunset, mostly to have nobody else there and to get it in the perfect light. The photo above was taken just after the sun dipped below the horizon. I was very happy with my choice of timing.  So how did I do all of this in a short amount of time and according to my time specifications?  Many of the famous things to do and see around Mandalay are an hour’s drive away from the city center. I also wanted to see specific things at optimal photo-taking and crowd-avoiding times, because I’m neurotic like that, and having a driver helps you to do it all in a short window of time. Plus, it’s very affordable.  My driver, Mr. Take it Easy, was one of the best guides I’ve ever had. He was thoughtful, gave me flowers in the morning, brought water, cared about my enjoyment of the experience, and was willing to come get me at 5:30am and drive me all around until sunset – all for the equivalent of $60. I could link an affiliate driver with a tour operator here to try to make a buck off of this, but I’d much rather you give this man your business. He really deserves it. Contact him here, and if this itinerary looks good to you, send him this link! *Please note that prices are changing quickly in Myanmar, and gas ain’t cheap, so if you book this in 6 months or a year after this writing, the price may have gone up. Mandalay was only the second stop in my Myanmar adventure, and it made me fall in love with the country and its people more. I’d never been anywhere with so many beautiful feats of architecture, and it was only the beginning.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/kakku-myanmar-pagodas/,Kakku Guide – Myanmar’s Amazing Pagodas,Myanmar,"Myanmar’s Kakku Pagodas showed up on my Instagram feed when I was elbow deep in research for my Myanmar trip. Near-ish to Inle Lake, the Mwe Taw Kakku Pagoda Complex seemed like the perfect off the beaten path alternative to the usual lake and temple tour. Like a corn maze of intricately decorated stupas, varying in color from white to gold, pink, and orange, these 2400+ stupas are arranged in such a way that you can weave through them, getting gloriously lost in a twinkling, bell-sounding forest of Buddhist devotion.  Most of the pagodas were constructed in the 17th and 18th centuries, and many of them have been restored after suffering earthquake damage. As you walk through you’ll notice that some appear to be even older. It’s believed that some of the stupas date back to King Aluangsithu, the 12th century King of Bagan (even some claims have them built back in the 3rd century B.C.E. under King Ashoka of the Indian empire). It was fun to visit after having seen the mostly-brick ruins of Bagan, imagining that they would have looked much like this had the outer stucco survived the test of time. The pagodas are located in the Shan State and were mainly constructed by the Pa-O people, the second largest minority group in the state. You’ll notice that the women wear headpieces that look similar to scarves on their heads – I loved their style.  You’ve got a couple of options to visit – either hire a private car like I did and go any time you please, or take a tour if you’d like to have a guide or would rather not go it alone. There are pros and cons to both:  I organized a private car for 50k kyat, plus 5k for the entrance fee. I liked not having to share the experience with many other people. Since the tour groups were almost all gone by the time I arrived at 3pm, I got the experience almost all to myself, complete with wind chiming the bells at the top of the pagodas. I sat and meditated in silence, and it was magical. I also got the pagodas in their best light by staying until sunset.  On the downside, we drove back in the dark, which was of course my choice, and it was quite the adventure, let’s say. However, the driver was very patient and totally willing to wait and drive me back past sunset, which I thought was quite nice. It was also entirely self-guided so my history lesson of the place consisted of Google’s answers.  I’d heard that if you took a private car you’d have to stop in town to pick up a guide, but that never happened so I’m unsure if that’s either no longer a rule, or perhaps I just went too late to need one.  Tours depart Inle Lake and will bring you to Kakku for about the same I paid, plus you get a guide. I could see this being a nice option if you’re solo and would rather not go alone, and you want someone to help you get this famous picture of the experience. Again, the price is the same for all this as hiring a private car assuming you’re solo. You can book it here You also get a nice historical overview, which I didn’t as a tourist with no guide. But you do get some crowds. Like I said, pros and cons! Either way the drive takes about an hour and 45 each way from Nyaungshwe, and yes, it’s worth it. Believe it or not, I never did see Inle Lake. It was quite smokey when I was there, and my only wish was to see Kakku during my short visit, but I did find an amazing place to stay and a crazy place to eat. I loved Inle Cottage Boutique Hotel and thought it was an amazing value. If you want to be truly entertained while eating some amazing Indian food, head to Innlay Hut Indian Food House (313). I’ll leave it at that. Would hate to spoil the surprise.  Happy travels in Myanmar – it’s been one of my favorite countries to date, and Kakku only helped to reinforce that love and wonder.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ethical-travel-myanmar/,Should Anyone Travel to Myanmar Right Now?,Myanmar,"Back in 2012, when I first started traveling in Southeast Asia, I met travelers who told me with stars in their eyes that Myanmar, which had just opened up to tourism after 50 years of government oppression, was the place for authentic culture. “Go before it changes”, they urged me.  The window of time for those golden years was short. 2015 saw Myanmar’s largest visitor numbers, followed by a sharp decline due to unspeakable actions, once again, by the Burmese military.  As we speak, the Nobel Peace Prize-decorated State Counsellor of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi, who had been so admired for enduring years of house arrest in the name of democracy, and devoting herself to Buddhist study, is being condemned by the UN for the Rohingya persecution. Since 2016, the Burmese armed forces and police have waged a forceful, often brutal crackdown on the Rohingya people in Rakhine State in Myanmar’s northwestern region. Not only that, but also two Reuters journalists who broke the news were imprisoned for over 500 days. Recently, Myanmar was ordered by the UN court to prevent the ongoing genocide, though only time will tell how they choose to comply. Knowing this, should anyone go to Myanmar? This question kept me from visiting for years, until I realized who I was really hurting by not going, and that I’d already done something very similar several times before, along with millions of other people. Let’s dive in:  First I think it’s important to point out another situation that gets almost no media attention.  Two years ago, I visited Raja Ampat in West Papua. It’s famous for diving and is one of the most gorgeous places I’ve ever been. The Indonesian government has sent numerous influencers there, many of whom I’m friends with and respect, and I’m guessing that just like me, they had no idea about the likely genocide.  There’s very little information broadcast by mainstream media, though freewestpapua.org (Warning: Disturbing images) claims over half a million lives have been lost through a brutal suppression of the people by the Indonesian military. While this can’t be verified and numbers vary greatly, this indicates a very grave situation, nonetheless. Like everyone else who has visited and fallen in love with West Papua, I adored the people (and even found out I had an avid fan there!), loved the place, and most importantly, spent money there. Or what about China? I spent two months traveling through the country, being shown amazing kindness by the Tibetan minority people in the autonomous prefecture. It had honestly never occurred to me that I shouldn’t be there. Supporting them felt like the best thing I could do.  That experience in West Papua taught me that the best thing I can do in these cases is to support the people who have no safety net. Am I hurting the Burmese military by deciding not to visit Bagan? Certainly not. But the fall in tourism numbers has hurt people like my tour guide in Mandalay who supports a family of three on his salary.  Still, to be able to work in tourism at all has given him the ability to put his children through school. He didn’t have the same opportunity, having to drop out in fourth grade to work in the fields and support his family’s survival. His English is all self-taught, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Tourism quite literally changed his life. This is just one example of individuals in Myanmar who have nothing to do with the crisis, but whose livelihoods depend on tourism.  So what should we do in cases like this? Our tourism dollars are meaningful to people in these areas although, yes, just by being in Myanmar, just as by being in Indonesia, I do spend money that will eventually support the military via taxes, and so do the 7 million people who visit Bali each year.  The same is probably true of my retirement investments, many of which track international markets and buy shares in companies that at some point, support regimes doing terrible things. The same is true of the iPhone you might be reading this on, which was likely manufactured in China.  Should people travel to China, North Korea, Syria? Should people even visit the United States given the migrant detention centers and treatment of people of color? Does boycotting a place make a difference? Did any major shift in women’s rights, the end of the genocide in Rwanda, or the end of apartheid have anything to do with tourism numbers? Of course not.  According to Gill Charlton, Telegraph Travel’s Myanmar expert, “it’s important to keep the fledgling tourist industry alive as so many small poor communities rely on it,” she said. “Staying away isn’t going to change the government’s treatment of the Rohingya community as tourism from Britain and other Western countries is a very small part of their revenue.” Boycotts might seem like a way to take a stance, and for a long time I felt that way about traveling to Myanmar, but now I understand something different:  The people of Myanmar are some of the kindest, most welcoming I’ve ever encountered. Just because someone lives in a country whose military or government takes certain actions, does not mean they agree or deserved to be punished for those actions.  I hope that people don’t assume that just because I’m from the US, I supported the war in Iraq (I protested against it in college), and that my government is representative of my personal values. I don’t want a wall, I believe that Black Lives Matter, and that nobody is illegal.  I also know that traveling to learn about and appreciate other cultures kills racism. We travel the world to see our own humanity in the faces of others. To realize that we are more alike than we are different, and to get to know our own world better. From my nearly 8 years as a solo female traveler, I know without fearing naïveté and without a doubt that people are mostly good.  I don’t have all of the answers, of course. I only have my own experiences. What I believe is just that – a thought, an opinion, and the same is true for everyone else. Should you travel to Myanmar right now? For me, putting money in the hands of small hotel and business owners in the developing world is more important than helping the CEO of a major hotel chain in London or Paris buy another vacation home. However it’s always a personal decision, and I hope this post helped you get a little closer to your answer.  Love, love, love this! Thanks for offering up a different perspective. When I first heard about the genocides in Myanmar years ago my initial reactions was “I will never travel there”. But you are so right when  you say that the people are not the government and boycotting countries (or anything really) only hurts the innocent. Same thought! Sometimes the best of intentions need to be reexamined. Wow. That’s really great. Myanmar is undoubtedly scenic and a little less explored place. As you have shown in your article, there is something for everyone. Starting from Archeological sites, to Pilgrim centre, natural ecosystems, local culture and tradition and much more. I must say that the photos captured are really impressive. Great Job. Keep posting your thoughts. But…. You also contribute to making Myanmar’s economy depend on tourism, and that’s not necessarily a sustainable way to build an economy. Take a look at Thailand for instance. As of now (2019-number), the tourism sector accounts for 20% of Thailand’s GDP, and it is estimated that that number will increase to 30% by 2030 (NESDEC).  Now, why is that so bad?Well, because there are quite many economic downsides of tourism – especially when an economy is over-reliant on tourism. At least, it’s not a sustainable way of building an economy. If we keep Thailand as an example, think about how devastating effects changing tourist patterns, natural disasters and economic recession could have for the economy – and that will, of course, be on behalf of Thai people. Further, the tourism sector is a season-based job sector, and therefore resulting in extreme job insecurity. That might not be too bad in a strong economy, especially not in a welfare state, but in a developing country?On top of that, tourism generally results in increasing prices making certain places within a country unaffordable to the average person.  Now, one could think that ‘bringing your money into a country’ is a good thing. Well, yes. That would, in theory, be correct. But, research shows that on average (in Thailand), 70% of all money spent in Thailand ends up leaving the country. Why? Well, because it goes to international airlines, hotel chains etc.  So, altogether I do agree in the things mentioned in the video, but my comment is to state that there certainly are other things to consider when visiting a country like Myanmar. Myanmar is not Thailand, but the “go before it changes” statement speaks about it possibly becoming like Thailand. And one should, must, consider this when traveling into a country: you *do contribute to making a country’s economy depend on tourism, and that *will exploit the country and the population.  On top of that, one could also speak about the environmental impacts of tourism, but that’s a different topic….  So, please, people, consider sustainable tourism! Prioritize countries with developed economies (like the US and Western Europe), don’t fly so much, and if you really wanna make a difference in a country like Myanmar, then first of all: don’t travel there. Second of all, spend some of your money supporting local NGO’s. I couldn’t agree less with you. People are getting opportunities there thanks to tourism that they didn’t have when they were younger. People who would otherwise have to work in a field for a pittance are getting more money, learning other languages, and are able to keep their kids in school thanks to tourism. As tourists we should focus on spending our money locally, I agree, but why only travel to developed countries? Come on now…🙄 I am sure it’s been mismanaged in plenty of places, but in many other places tourism has led to greater conservation efforts and opportunities for locals and I don’t think it should only be an opportunity reserved for richer, developed nations.  Also, it’s ‘NGOs’ no apostrophe needed. Apostrophes are for conjunctions and to show possession.  Right on sister Namaste peace and 😍 Totally agreed! I visited Myanmar in 2016 and it was one of the friendliest places I’ve ever been to. I’ve grappled with the same thoughts a lot recently, especially because last year I visited many areas that a lot of people are against on principle (Iran, Israel) but it’s really important to understand that people are not their government and that boycotting travel is not really helping anyone. Maybe it would be different somewhere in like North Korea where all the money you spend goes to the government but if you can travel and spend money independently, I don’t see the problem in visiting controversial places. Yes!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bagan-hot-air-balloon/,How to Fly over Bagan in a Hot Air Balloon (+Costs and Where to Book),Myanmar,"When one searches images of Bagan, the most awe-inspiring ones tend to depict the sunrise with hot air balloons all along the horizon, floating above the millennium-old pagodas.  This post will help you decide who to book with, and whether to go in a hot air balloon at all while you’re in Bagan.  Now that all of the temples are closed to climbing in Bagan, there’s almost no way to get an aerial view anymore. Though I did see an errant drone from time to time in Myanmar, there are signs when you enter at the airport that forbid drones in Bagan, and due to somewhat dubious drone laws, I was too scared to bring mine. That only leaves you with a crowded experience on the watch tower, or a magical experience floating over Bagan in a hot air balloon if you want the iconic views.  It’s just as magical as you imagine it’s going to be flying in a hot air balloon. You get a bird’s eye view, the experience of floating above the temples that you can’t otherwise get, and a magical sunrise all in unison. However there is one big con – the price.  The flight costs $350-ish per person and lasts for only 45 minutes. Still, it’s understandably on a lot of people’s bucket lists. Here’s how to book if it’s on yours:  There are three main companies that operate hot air balloons over Bagan: Oriental Ballooning, Balloons over Bagan, and Golden Eagle.  I did lots of research and read dozens of reviews trying to find pros and cons of each. According to Wayne, who flew with Golden Eagle, “The flight itself was spectacular and everything I imagined it would be. Our pilot, Blake, was very knowledgeable and pointed out the important temples and landmarks. Not only was he a great pilot but had a wonderful sense of humor and personality. Our landing was right on target and much smoother than I had expected. Overall, I couldn’t be happier with this experience.” Dang, sounds pretty good!  But all of them have amazing reviews, offer the same perks and experience, and are more or less the same price, however I did notice that Balloons over Bagan always took off last, for what that’s worth.  The best price I could find was for Golden Eagle, which is $25 less through this link and offers 20% discounts from time to time, though they’re rare.  Do plan to book in advance, as this is a very popular activity and they tend to book out days to weeks ahead of time. Also note that they only run during the dry season, from early October to early April.  Each tour includes a pickup at your hotel before dawn at around 5am. They provide cookies with hot tea and coffee while you wait for the balloons to be ready. Unless you book the more expensive experience, which you’ll share with 8 people, there will be 12 people in the balloon basket. Since these flights are so popular, you can probably plan on a full basket.  The flight will last for 45 minutes and will take off just as the sun crests the horizon. Upon landing you’ll be offered sparkling wine and snacks while touts swarm to sell you post cards and souvenirs.  So what did I do while in Bagan? When presented with the pros and cons of hot air ballooning over Bagan, I actually opted not to do it. I read so much about it and looked into it so extensively that I still wanted to write this post in case you’re on the fence, too. My partner and I were looking at $700 for the two of us ($650 through the Golden Eagle link I found), but even if we’d wanted to, at that point I wouldn’t have jumped on it early enough to nab a spot. That said, I flew in a hot air balloon in Germany and truly did love it. It felt like a fairytale, and I can only imagine that Bagan would be that much better. However, I also wanted to be in the picture with the balloons, though the coveted overview shot of Bagan is much harder to come by now than it was when the temples were still open for climbing. So I spent 4 days searching out all of the best sunrise and sunset spots, which you can find here.  If I had to do over again, I might spring for the ballooning. It is expensive, but I do feel just a little bit like I might have missed out. Still, I had a wonderful Bagan experience regardless.  However you choose to spend your time in Bagan, I’m sure you’ll fall in love with it like I did – there’s nothing in the world like it!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bagan-myanmar-best-sunrise-and-sunset/,"Bagan, Myanmar’s Best Sunrise and Sunset Spots",Myanmar,"I’m in an open field as the red sun crests the horizon. I feel like I’ve struck Bagan gold because while the hot air balloons float directly overhead, I’ve got a front-row view and I’m not sharing it with anyone else – no selfie stick wielding crowds nor busloads of people. The real adventure, though, was in how I found it and how you can, too.  Bagan, Myanmar is the stuff of fairytales – except it’s all real and open to explore. Built between the 9th and 13th centuries, Bagan is home to 2,230 still-standing Buddhist temples, pagodas, and monasteries out of the original 4,446. For years Bagan has attracted travelers from all over the world who could explore this area by bike, foot, tuk-tuk, or car. Famous for its sunrises with floating balloons and glorious sunsets, I was very much looking forward to taking in both from atop a centuries-old temple.  Except when I arrived I found out that all temples were, for now, completely closed. They’re either locked or walled in. That means no more ascending for sunrise, and no more of those famous views of thousands of temples as they stretch out to the Irrawaddy River at sunset. I get it, though. A 2016 earthquake badly damaged many of the temples and given how old they are, it’s only natural that Myanmar would want to protect one of its most treasured archeological sites – the largest in Myanmar. It’s a huge tourism draw and was recently designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to boot. So where can you see the sunrise and sunset in Bagan now? I went on a 4-day quest to answer that question, and I’ve got you covered:  The natural choice for seeing the beautiful balloons cascade through the sky is to be in one yourself. Indeed, the photos people have of this experience, plus the positive reviews, do make it tempting. Besides, YOLO, right?  Sorry for using YOLO.  It wasn’t quite in my budget for this trip to drop $325 per person on a balloon excursion. But if you’re keen, Golden Eagle via GetYourGuide is the absolute cheapest option I’ve found. These book out pretty far in advance and only run from early October to early April, during the dry season.  Many feel it’s an abomination, disrupting the otherwise perfectly ancient horizon. It’s true – this is one ugly building, and at sunrise and sunset, it’s mobbed with people. I really did want to know what the view from the top looked like, though, so I went at golden hour, paid my $2.50 to get in (It’s normally $5, but we got coupons for staying at Aureum Palace, more about that later…), so I figured why not? The view is pretty good, but almost too high, if you ask me.  If you want to go rogue and have the rises and sets to yourself, check out the next few spots: Given that you can’t get high anymore without disrespecting the rules or damaging a crumbling building, the next best thing is to find an open space to view from. The best way to do this is to get on the tiny side roads that not even tuk-tuks can go down, much less buses full of tourists.  I searched out both places prior to going back in the morning, just so that I’d be sure I knew where I was going in the dark. The first one was great for seeing the balloons going overhead, in front of, and behind us. Best of all, nobody else was there. The road there is just a small dirt track, and you can find it at these coordinates: 21.172032, 94.887359. I’d also input 21.169633, 94.886478 into your GPS as that’s the turnoff from the dirt road.  The second spot was closer to Shwesandaw Pagoda, the temple everyone formerly climbed for sunrise. The field in front of it allowed us to see all of the balloons pass from left to right along the horizon. They were farther away, but that created a different feel that I liked equally. The coordinates are 21.165036, 94.868072. It’s worth mentioning that locals will offer to take you to a temple that they claim you can climb. They’ll want money for the exchange and while I respect the hustle, I encourage you not to follow them. It’s illegal to climb, and you’ll be the one to get in trouble if you get caught. Nearby the first field, this pagoda has a nice view and the benefit of you likely being the only person there, but the view of the sun is partially obstructed by the trees and the field behind it is much better. Still, you’ll likely be the only one there for sunset.  This is the only temple I found that has a somewhat elevated view without any need to climb. The first level of the temple has a wraparound verandah that faces the sunset and was a nice place to watch from. We didn’t have to share it, either.  As an alternative to the temples, there are mounds all around that provide a somewhat elevated view. They range from sort of crowded to completely packed with hundreds of people. I visited O Bo Gon Hill for my first sunset and quickly realized the mounds would not be for me. However if you want to check them out, I highly recommend downloading the Myanmar offline map on maps.me. It’s super useful in Myanmar in general and will help you navigate Bagan on bicycle. It has all of the mounds and temples listed, often with reviews.  Generally I wouldn’t promote a big 5-star chain on the blog, but there’s no denying that you can get an amazing view from the pool and pond at this hotel. I spent most of my Bagan adventure at the Hotel at Tharabar Gate, which was great, though I did pay up to spend one night at the Aureum Palace Hotel so that I could have the sunrise and sunset view.  The balloons all take off right in front of the hotel, so it’s a very nice, close view that you get of them all, plus the reflection on the pools. The whole sunrise experience goes a lot faster here, with the balloons taking off then disappearing. It felt a lot longer, more private, and free from my other vantage points. I would also suggest only staying there for one night, since it’s quite far from any restaurants and that forces you to eat at their overpriced, rather marginal one.  Hells yes! Though I did kick myself for not making it to Myanmar sooner so that I could have the Indiana Jones experience, if I’d never heard of or seen photos of people climbing on the pagodas it wouldn’t have occurred to me that anyone should do such a thing. It’s truly amazing to experience Bagan firsthand and there is nothing in the world like it.  Make sure you bike around a bunch, catch every sunset and sunrise, hire a tuk-tuk to take you around to all of the famous temples to give someone a job and cover more ground, and make sure to order the tomato peanut curry at Yar Pyi Vegetarian Restaurant. Enjoy Bagan, a peek into Myanmar’s devoted and illustrious past.  I wanted to thank you for inspiring our Backpacker’s Dream.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/affordable-maldives-resort/,How to Have an Affordable Maldives Vacation,Maldives,"A couple of years ago I was browsing the interwebs from a little flat in Bologna when an email came through for a discount flight to the Maldives. Only $100 to fly to my dream destination? Um, hells yeah!  At the time, I was in year two of my indefinite journey and my income was at about zero. But I had wanted to dive in the Maldives for as long as I could remember and I trusted that I would find a way to afford it. I had to find a way. Only about a month and a half later, I found myself on the Ari Atoll staying with a local family at a guest house that I had booked through Airbnb. The Maldives had only recently passed legislation that allowed locals to open up their own guest houses, so I was amongst the first wave of backpackers to visit the Maldives. I felt like I had stumbled upon some huge secret! Everyone seemed to think that you needed to be a millionare to visit the Maldives but there I was with a backpack and not much else to my name. I swam with Manta Rays and whale sharks, we rented scuba equipment from sea cucumber fisherman. We ate with our hands. There were some things missing, though. I couldn’t have any alcohol or wear a bikini on the local islands. The Maldives is a strict muslim country and those two things are no-nos there. I could get over the alcohol, but it was a bummer that I couldn’t swim until I left the island. I always did wonder what it would be like to stay at a resort, where both things are permitted. When I found myself in Sri Lanka this year, I figured it was high time to find out if it was still possible to stay there without being super rich. I stayed at an affordable Maldives resort this time that was all-inclusive of food, drinks, and most importantly, diving. This time, I went to the cinnamon Ellaidhoo on the Ari Atoll, the same atoll that I had visited the first time. Only this time around, I took a seaplane to get there and the view was incredible, with circles and clusters of coral reef and overwater bungalows. I especially loved that the captain didn’t even wear shoes. I didn’t either the entire time that I was in the Maldives. I felt like that made us kindred. Upon touching down a few things were immediately apparent: This was clearly an island just dedicated to the resort and tourists, and there weren’t many locals there. Since they can’t serve alcohol or pork, jobs for locals are limited to cleaning, entertainment, and guiding. Therefore on resort islands, you’re more likely to meet people from all over the world working there. The resort islands also have those iconic overwater bungalows, which are generally missing from the local islands. Though I didn’t stay in one, they sure do make for good photos. Another thing I loved about staying on Ellaidhoo was that I could take scuba gear or snorkeling equipment out anytime I wanted to go diving or swimming along the house reef, which was a really impressive reef with tons of fish. Anywhere that offers me unlimited diving is a huge value in my book. My first day out, within the first minute, I saw a reef shark. True to what I have seen the last time I was there, I saw schools of fish, beautiful corals, and had even heard that some divers saw a whale shark one of the mornings there. I was bummed to have missed that but it just goes to show you can spot some seriously impressive underwater animals in the Maldives. I wondered if I’d miss the local experience I had the previous time, and while I did love the chance to immerse myself in Maldivian culture, I also fully immersed myself in the resort culture, too. That’s a serious rarity for me but in the Maldives, it was perfect. On the local island I drank a lot of sweetened iced coffee, on the resort island, I had an all-inclusive wristband and went for beer. Is it shameful to admit that I prefer the latter?  I also did really like being able to hang out in my bikini in the pool or in the water all day.  The two experiences were so different, to prefer one over the other would be like comparing passion fruit and summer cherries. They both belong in my life and omigod please don’t make me choose! I loved them both, and I love that both are affordable (full disclosure, I didn’t pay for this second trip but rooms at the Cinnamon Ellaidhoo can be a great deal, particularly in the off season. You can find the room rates here). Something I can definitively say when comparing the two is that in both places I really felt welcomed. The locals on the local Island were kind, and the staff at the resort were also incredibly catering and attentive. I left feeling like both ways, perhaps during the same trip, are the perfect way to experience the Maldives. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts. They did not ask me to write a favorable review and frankly if they had I would still write exactly what I think here. Your trust always comes first! I’m not really a beach/resort person but also maybe that wouldn’t be so true if I visited somewhere like this… That sounds so fun though, and I’m amazed that more people don’t really talk about the Maldives! I’m not really a resort person either but when I can dive all I want I tend to be more into it 🙂 Good to read Kristin! We are currently in the Maldives on a delayed honeymoon (8-years later haha) and loving it! We also looked at the guesthouse options too as we typically always prefer the local experience, but actually found the freedom the all-inclusive resorts offered by way of bikinis and alcohol much more appealing (and really a better value). So, here, here to fun in the Maldives x I’m usually all about the local experience too, and I also really enjoyed that, but agree that being able to wear a bikini and have a drink on a beach holiday is important to me! I have never been a resort person, but I think I could make an exception here 🙂 This is so on my bucket list. I’m thinking of burning some United miles before they devalue the awards chart in October so I’m thinking of stopping over in the Maldives for a week before heading to SE Asia. I’m curious, what’s the best time of year to go to the Maldives? What’s the off-season? How long did you stay? Thanks for the great write-up!Michelle Not quiet affordable to a backpacker cheaper than places like four seasons but still $600+ a night ? But still looks amazing!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/maldives-budget-hotel/,The Amazing Noovilu: The Best Maldives BnB,Maldives,"It was a sunny day in Bologna, Italy and the September sun was still bright on the orange-walled coffee shops and gelaterias around me.  I had just landed after a long-haul flight from Los Angeles to start on my second year of consecutive travel around the world. Per usual, I hadn’t planned a thing and was looking for inspiration. As I took a sip of my delicious cappuccino the laptop went bing! with a flight alert from Air Asia with a cheap flight they had just released from Kuala Lumpur to the Maldives.  I knew I would find myself back in Asia eventually, and I do have a very soft spot in my heart for Malaysia, so knowing I’d get back to KL eventually, I got to searching. This began an adventure of staying on a local island and doing the Maldives on a pretty extreme budget (well, as far as the Maldives are concerned, anyway).  Want to know how I did it? It was a cinch: Step one: Booking a cheap flight to Malé The first step is to get a flight into Malé, the only international airport in the Maldives.  Air Asia is who I tend to fly with the most around Asia, given how cheap the fares can be, especially when booked right after receiving one of their discount emails.  You can sign up here to become a member. Utilizing their monthly fare comparison tool, I was able to find a flight departing in November that looked like it would work for me.  I selected a total of six days which ended up being the perfect amount.  It’s easy enough to find these fares, if you can be flexible, by using their fare comparison chart: After speaking to a few others once on the ground in the Maldives who had traveled from Europe and Dubai using Emirates, which is certainly preferable to Air Asia comfort and mileage-wise, I realized that a lot of airlines are now offering rather cheap flights.  Other good places to find fares include cheap booking agents like CheapOair or whichever your favorite discount booking website may be. Step Two: Find the right guesthouse I previously wrote at length about how the Maldives has started to allow locals to open up guesthouses on local islands.  This has spawned a network of affordable guesthouses available for as low as $40/night for a room that accommodates two.  In general these rooms are pretty clean, have air conditioning, 24-hour electricity, and are comfortable.  Wifi and Western-style bathrooms with hot water are not a guarantee, however, so do some reading up on amenities before you book. The way to find the right guesthouse is to find the right booking website.  There are three I would highly recommend for booking, two of which I actively use myself and the other was recommended by the other guests staying at my guesthouse: I personally stayed at a guesthouse called the Amazing Noovilu (which you can book on AirBnB) which ran at $100/night but included meals.  I really enjoyed the local experience it provided and was able to get everything planned ahead of time by speaking with the highly attentive staff there. They were also able to help me get from Malé to Mahibadoo, which is on Ari Atoll, easily by using local transport. It seemed that most guesthouses did include meals, which can otherwise be found at local coffee shops that dot all of the islands. Keep in mind that once you arrive in Malé, you’ll need to get to your destination of choice.  Some hotels offer a transfer service while others do not.  You can get a ferry from the airport to Malé itself which is a few dollars and leaves when full.  From there, take a taxi to the ferry station that services the rest of the islands.  Be forewarned that not every day offers a local ferry (which ran at about $20 for Mahibadoo).  Check the ferry schedule when considering your flight bookings. Step Three:  Activities! Most smaller guesthouses offer tons of awesome activities from snorkeling, to fishing, to SCUBA diving.  These are things that can typically be booked on the ground in person but do heavily depend on what your guest house owner can provide. I personally paid $30 for Manta Ray snorkeling, which ended up being a nearly-private tour with just my travel buddy and myself and our guesthouse owner, who doubled as our tour guide.  He mentioned that the boats coming from the nearby resorts charged hundreds of dollars per person.  It was clear who got the better deal! Diving and excursions were closer to $60-$75 each, but still provided a very small-group feel that I absolutely loved. You can find more budget Maldives tips here. Things to Consider Staying on a local island vs. a resort is not without its differences.  For one, the Maldives is a Muslim country, therefore bikinis are a no-no on the local islands.  This is not a huge deal as most of the excursions take place in the middle of the ocean or on bikini beaches where it’s perfectly fine to don a bikini. One other big consideration is alcohol.  You can forget about toasting with wine on the local islands where alcohol (and pork!) is forbidden.  I’d also suggest NOT staying on Malé which is just a big city without the beautiful beaches and swaying palm trees you’d probably expect in the Maldives.  Moreover, there’s a bit of instability recently due to elections. Lastly, the local islands are not as pristine as the resort islands.  Though they’re catching up and are still absolutely beautiful, be forewarned that there are still some growing pains and some room for improvement. That said, I wouldn’t have changed my experience for anything, and truly enjoyed being able to do the Maldives for far under the thousands of dollars per day I feared it would cost.  Being able to experience it from an authentic, local experience made it the trip of a lifetime for me. This is a great resource – I had no idea about the cheap flights from KL and the guesthouses. I have a friend who just got a dive instructor job in the Maldives and is always bugging me to visit… I just might have to do that! Nice! You should go you’d love the diving Beautiful blog !  Last year I gifted Maldives trip to my brother which cost me dam expensive ( 3500$ + around ) for just 4N..  Since a day I stopped dreaming abt this destination hahah coz I need more days to explore any where.. Thanks for a good post ! This truly gave me good hopes for future..  Thanks for sharing .. That’s a nice gift! Thanks for the ideas.Maldives has been my dream escapade yet hesitant to go there because of the idea that I thought the resorts there are very expensive. Maldives is a must visit country for me. Great post! Now you can go! I just found your blog through Pinterest. Very cool! Great information! Thanks! This looks heavenly. Did you feel restricted in not being allowed to wear a bathing suit, though? I wore one once we left the island by boat which was almost daily, so no, not really Perfect timing.  I’ve been researching a way to get to the Maldives, and have always hesitated because I just am not a resort type girl.  Great info, and I’ve just flown Air Asia for the first time a few weeks ago…nice for the price! I generally like them as an airline. I’m not a resort girl either, so this was perfect for me! Great collection of tips! FlyDubai has also started flights to Male and has some great fares (but lousy flight times). Also there are daily snorkeling/ diving tours from Male often just $20/day. These tours often take you to a hotel island – gicing you the same beach others buy for $500+. Awesome thanks for the tips! Hi,Thank you to share your experience with us.We stayed too in a local island Bodu Huraa in Male North in a guest house. It was great and we ‘d like to return in Maldives next year.We are very interesting to visit Male South and I found your guest house.I’d like to know if you can go to the beach on this island. Do you have pictures of the beach?Best regards There was no bikini beach, unfortunately, but i was mostly on the boat doing excursions Kristin, Thanks for this info. How expensive are the ferries to go from one island to another? or the scuba diving or other water activities? That depends on how far you go but around $20 for ferries and $65-ish for diving, at least with my guide. Thanks your article inspires me so much since I　really don’t want to wait until I find the proper partner to visit Maldives. But again will be very awkward to visit Maldives alone? I don’t have any problem to visit big city by myself but not sure about an isolated island like Maldives? Any suggestion? Bring a friend! I’m not sure since I didn’t try, but that is definitely something the Airbnb host should be able to tell you. The Maldives has become so popular within the last couple of years. I’ve just used airbnb a couple of times and thought I would start looking at that as an option. Glad you mentioned them. Thanks for the information and tips on where to fly into as well. Have a great time! Hi, thanks for the post. Really enjoyed reading it, specially since you made a bucket list destination sound more accessible! Just a few thoughts came to my mind: i know the deal and we can’t expect everything by paying less but I was wondering, are the beaches in the local islands you visited as stunning as the ones that are typical of Maldives (read: turquoise gorgeous colour, white sand)? And are the excursion trips and the islands visited crowded (like it was in Thailand!)?  Planning to go in a few months and contemplating if we should go Guesthouse mdoe! The beaches on the local island I stayed on were not that amazing and you can’t wear a bikini there, however we never stayed on that island because we were always on the boat doing excursions. We went to a private sandy beach as well which was perfect and nobody else was there. We also got a swim with Manta Rays all to ourselves as well. It was definitely the way to go for me! Swimming with Wale sharks was very crowded, though. I believe because it’s the one place everyone knows they show up. This is really useful, even though I’ve already been to Maldives once several years ago, it’s nice to see an updated and detailed budget. This is a wonderful guide about a destination that many consider extremely expensive. Thanks for posting!  Also, I see you are now in Patagonia. Just got back from there a week ago. Stunning! It is beautiful! yes, the Maldives can be really expensive and it’s still not a ‘budget’ destination but it’s doable which is great! I love your blog and your writing, but most especially appreciate your honesty, transparency and generosity with detailed information. You must be very organized. Question: You say in this post that you had three booking sites you were recommending, two you had used and one that was used by another guest at the guesthouse you stayed at, but you only mention two in the post. Did you change your mind about the third one or was it just an oversight? Care to share if it just got left out? Thanks for all your work on the blog. It is such a great resource. I have a few questions that don’t really fit as pertinent comments on any of the many dozens of posts I have read. Is it okay to email you with them? I don’t want to be a bother. Hi Carol, I would actually suggest booking this one on AirBnB, I can’t remember what the other guys used to be honest! Sorry!  I try to limit the travel advice I give as I’m not a travel agent, it takes a ton of my time and I am already REALLY swamped as it is, and I’ve written so many posts about planning and trip help. Please use the search bar at the top of the site for anything specific but if you still have a burning unanswered question that might deserve its own blog post do feel free to email me! 🙂 thanks for the info.regarding the comparison fare chart, is that an apps?i think i need that..? That’s google flights Excellent article , congrats !We also visited few local islands when we went to Maldives ( Tulusdhoo, Maafushi, Rasdhoo, Mahibadhoo) and locals were so friendly and nice ! But  unfortunately there is not much to do on these islands. We stopped there just for few hours for a bit of shopping and beach and rest of the time we were cruising around Maldives. If you decide to go Maldives you should definitely try the cruising option. With 2 friends we hired a private wooden vessel through a local travel agency and we cruised around different atolls. It was just fantastic as we managed to see a lot of Maldives and to experience the real Maldivian life . Cruise option is perfect for budget travelers who want to avoid the overpriced luxury resort ( and also for people who would like to enjoy an alcoholic cocktail while looking at the sunset ). I think that most places end up being more expensive than Southeast Asia, but you can do it for an average of $50 per day, I’d say. The rooms are more like $30 at a minimum and food runs maybe $10 per day if you’re thrifty, which it sounds like you are.

Great info, and I’ve just flown Air Asia for the first time a few weeks ago…nice for the price! I generally like them as an airline. I’m not a resort girl either, so this was perfect for me! Great collection of tips! FlyDubai has also started flights to Male and has some great fares (but lousy flight times). Also there are daily snorkeling/ diving tours from Male often just $20/day. These tours often take you to a hotel island – gicing you the same beach others buy for $500+. Awesome thanks for the tips! Hi,Thank you to share your experience with us.We stayed too in a local island Bodu Huraa in Male North in a guest house. It was great and we ‘d like to return in Maldives next year.We are very interesting to visit Male South and I found your guest house.I’d like to know if you can go to the beach on this island. Do you have pictures of the beach?Best regards There was no bikini beach, unfortunately, but i was mostly on the boat doing excursions Kristin, Thanks for this info. How expensive are the ferries to go from one island to another? or the scuba diving or other water activities? That depends on how far you go but around $20 for ferries and $65-ish for diving, at least with my guide. Thanks your article inspires me so much since I　really don’t want to wait until I find the proper partner to visit Maldives. But again will be very awkward to visit Maldives alone? I don’t have any problem to visit big city by myself but not sure about an isolated island like Maldives? Any suggestion? Bring a friend! I’m not sure since I didn’t try, but that is definitely something the Airbnb host should be able to tell you. The Maldives has become so popular within the last couple of years. I’ve just used airbnb a couple of times and thought I would start looking at that as an option. Glad you mentioned them. Thanks for the information and tips on where to fly into as well. Have a great time! Hi, thanks for the post. Really enjoyed reading it, specially since you made a bucket list destination sound more accessible! Just a few thoughts came to my mind: i know the deal and we can’t expect everything by paying less but I was wondering, are the beaches in the local islands you visited as stunning as the ones that are typical of Maldives (read: turquoise gorgeous colour, white sand)? And are the excursion trips and the islands visited crowded (like it was in Thailand!)?  Planning to go in a few months and contemplating if we should go Guesthouse mdoe! The beaches on the local island I stayed on were not that amazing and you can’t wear a bikini there, however we never stayed on that island because we were always on the boat doing excursions. We went to a private sandy beach as well which was perfect and nobody else was there. We also got a swim with Manta Rays all to ourselves as well. It was definitely the way to go for me! Swimming with Wale sharks was very crowded, though. I believe because it’s the one place everyone knows they show up. This is really useful, even though I’ve already been to Maldives once several years ago, it’s nice to see an updated and detailed budget. This is a wonderful guide about a destination that many consider extremely expensive. Thanks for posting!  Also, I see you are now in Patagonia. Just got back from there a week ago. Stunning! It is beautiful! yes, the Maldives can be really expensive and it’s still not a ‘budget’ destination but it’s doable which is great! I love your blog and your writing, but most especially appreciate your honesty, transparency and generosity with detailed information. You must be very organized. Question: You say in this post that you had three booking sites you were recommending, two you had used and one that was used by another guest at the guesthouse you stayed at, but you only mention two in the post. Did you change your mind about the third one or was it just an oversight? Care to share if it just got left out? Thanks for all your work on the blog. It is such a great resource. I have a few questions that don’t really fit as pertinent comments on any of the many dozens of posts I have read. Is it okay to email you with them? I don’t want to be a bother. Hi Carol, I would actually suggest booking this one on AirBnB, I can’t remember what the other guys used to be honest! Sorry!  I try to limit the travel advice I give as I’m not a travel agent, it takes a ton of my time and I am already REALLY swamped as it is, and I’ve written so many posts about planning and trip help. Please use the search bar at the top of the site for anything specific but if you still have a burning unanswered question that might deserve its own blog post do feel free to email me! 🙂 thanks for the info.regarding the comparison fare chart, is that an apps?i think i need that..? That’s google flights Excellent article , congrats !We also visited few local islands when we went to Maldives ( Tulusdhoo, Maafushi, Rasdhoo, Mahibadhoo) and locals were so friendly and nice ! But  unfortunately there is not much to do on these islands. We stopped there just for few hours for a bit of shopping and beach and rest of the time we were cruising around Maldives. If you decide to go Maldives you should definitely try the cruising option. With 2 friends we hired a private wooden vessel through a local travel agency and we cruised around different atolls. It was just fantastic as we managed to see a lot of Maldives and to experience the real Maldivian life . Cruise option is perfect for budget travelers who want to avoid the overpriced luxury resort ( and also for people who would like to enjoy an alcoholic cocktail while looking at the sunset ). I think that most places end up being more expensive than Southeast Asia, but you can do it for an average of $50 per day, I’d say. The rooms are more like $30 at a minimum and food runs maybe $10 per day if you’re thrifty, which it sounds like you are.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/maldives-local-islands/,The Maldives Unlike You’ve Ever Seen it Before: Local Style,Maldives,"Newlywed couples stroll along white sand beaches, hand in hand.  Their bungalow sits over the water, with bleached white sheets and a dedicated staff who serve them steak dinners, rent them expensive jet skis, and offer them boat trips with other foreign guests. They spend $3,000 per night on this bungalow, but it’s a once-in-a-lifetime occasion!  Sure, it could be just about anywhere with beautiful beaches (and trust me, the world has more of them than one could ever hope to see), but it’s the Maldives, so it’s exclusive, and out of the reach of most people, right? What if I told you none of this has to be true?  What if I told you there are locally-owned guest houses in the Maldives, and it’s entirely possible to go there, even as a solo traveler, and have a completely authentic experience without feeling like the only odd man out without a spouse or boatloads of cash? Guess what? That’s exactly what I’m telling you. I had wanted to visit the Maldives ever since I first heard about it.  I knew it was amazing for diving and I had always dreamed of seeing it for myself.  When an email came through for one of the low cost airlines I subscribe to, I realized I could fly over for a couple hundred dollars and booked it without hesitation – I would figure out the rest later. At first I was afraid it would break the bank.  Not only that, I’d be the only solo traveler in a sea of couples.  Then I found something out that changed my perspective completely. Staying Local  Three years ago, the Maldives opened up the possibility to locals to open guesthouses and welcome travelers to locally-inhabited islands, thereby providing an authentic and budget friendly alternative to resorts. I found this one via AirBnB. Given it’s still such a small market (the place I stayed at will be fully booked for the first time ever this month, though it’s only three rooms anyway), local tourism in the Maldives is relatively new and provides a great opportunity for travelers who want to experience something more authentic. I stayed at a place called the Amazing Noovilu, run by an upbeat and always smiling local named Mazin, with his family providing the rest of the support from cleaning rooms to driving boats to cooking the meals.  The room itself ran $100 per night, though I saw several options on Airbnb for closer to $50, making it a truly budget-friendly way to explore the Maldives. Even better than that, Mazin ate each meal with us, which was almost always a traditional Maldivian meal, complete with grilled fish, a delicious bread called roshi, rice, curries, veggies, and lots of tuna. Awesome almost-private tours Perhaps the best part of the trip, and what remains the best kept secret on the Maldives at the moment, is how private each tour we did ended up being.  It was typically just myself, Mazin, his brother driving the boat, and the buddy I was traveling with. “We must look like really big deals,” we joked to each other, being driven around in a private boat, just the two of us.  Yet we were paying less for the privilege. We swam with Manta rays and Whale Sharks, getting the opportunity to stay and float with them as long as we wanted while several boat loads of people came and left, only getting a short glimpse. Possibly my favorite thing about the whole experience was getting to dive one-on-one with Mazin.  He rented diving equipment from local sea cucumber fishermen, took me out on the little speedboat, and guided dives in some of the best reefs in this world – all without any other divers around. Fishing on a local fisherman’s boat under the stars and going to a deserted island with the others staying at the guest house were additional cherries on top of an already fantastic trip. Interacting with the locals Especially moving was the reception from the locals on Mahibadoo.  When visiting the local outdoor coffee shop (the main hangout for locals), the owner came over twice to make sure the coffee and service was to my liking. “I told him not to make it too sweet. I used to work in the resorts. I know Europeans don’t like it too sweet,” he said. Then there was the encounter with a couple of young local girls who waited outside of my garden door, waiting to present me with some gifts – a set of hair barrettes and a pen.  It was an incredibly touching gesture (and honestly, I needed a pen! I had misplaced mine). I couldn’t have expected that this kind of no-frills trip to the Maldives would be so much fun and such a rewarding experience.  I’m glad to know that it’s possible to go and do it local, and to have crossed an item off of the never-ending bucket list. Do it yourself: That looks so amazing! I really have fallen in love with you and your blog, I check for updates daily! You have great stories and wonderful off the beaten path information! Thanks so much Kylie! I try! I really appreciate your kind comment 🙂 Wow, I have always put this place at the furthest corner of my mind because I was under the impression of it being expensive and lots of honeymoon couples hanging around. So thank you for making me realise that it is possible to enjoy the beauty of the place and get the authentic feel os the place. 😀 I will put this country in the one of the possible places to go in 2014! I thought that too but I had always wanted to go there so badly. It’s great that now it’s an option for everyone! When I was struggling with the heat in India this summer I almost headed to the Maldives but thought there was no way to do it on a budget… If only you had written this earlier 🙁 Best put it on the list for the future then! You did it the right way, that’s for sure. After 18 months of traveling I learnt that staying with locals turns out to be always the best option, at least it has been for me so far. You don’t need a 5 stars resort to enjoy a  place, thanks for sharing! 🙂 Completely agreed it’s always the best way to experience a place Thanks for this extremely helpful article. I always wanted to go to Maldives, but had not really planned the trip because I felt it was too expensive and not suitable for a solo traveler like me. But this article changed all that! I can’t wait to share this with my friends! glad you found it helpful! Yes, it was really good to find out it doesn’t have to be all couples and honeymooners! wow such vivid colours This is an experience of my dreams. How amazing to get to experience local activities without it seeming like a show is being put on for you as a tourist. The girls giving you those gifts is just adorable. I could dive into that photo of the reef. I know! I was so touched by that! I love that it doesn’t have to be super expensive too. It was all around perfect. Maldives looks like a perfect place to visit. Kristin, After reading your post, I am hoping to do Maldives on a budget with my husband and 3.5 year old daughter. Mazin’s place is however booked. Do you have any other recommendations? Ideally a place not more than 2-3 hours by ferry from Male which is good for snorkelling and diving. Looking at all the options is very confusing so if you have any other reviews, it would be really helpful. Mazin’s is the only place I’ve stayed, but in this article I wrote for nomadic matt I described, in detail, how to get around the Maldives and a few websites you can use for booking. I’d suggest airbnb which gives you a map view of guesthouses, and then cross referencing with trip advisor: http://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/travel-to-the-maldives-budget/ I am researching for an article about tourism in the Maldives and this write-up was of great use to me. This beautiful atoll country actually has an immensely troubled political history, and none of its tensions and effects are remotely apparent on the exclusive resort islands–what a pity, right?I went to the Maldives for the first time last year, stayed in Male, Maafushi and Addu atoll, and was witness to the daily life in a unique country with a completely absorbing history. I found out more about that while I was in the Maldives. I think there were protests in Male in the months prior to my arrival. A resort would be pretty, I’m sure, but staying with locals was the coolest experience I could have had. I lived in Maldives for almost a year so can definitely back you up girl! Budget, authentic travel in Maldives IS possible!! Great article, what lovely memories you’ve made. 🙂 Wow what a cool experience that must have been! Hey Kristin, If you don’t mind, I’d like to share a list of other nice and peaceful local islands: – Rasdhoo; – Ukulhas; – Mathiveri; – Thoddoo; – Dhigurah; (All of them in Ari Atoll as Mahibadhoo) – Dharavandhoo, Baa Atoll – Thinadhoo, Vaavu Atoll – Guraidhoo, South Male Atoll How do we find a place to stay in these places please? I’d check out Airbnb What about gays?  Since it’s a Muslim country, I’m assuming if I were to go with my boyfriend, I would have to hide PDA?  Which is fine but would be unfortunate. I can’t answer that from experience but these guys did a pretty good write up on it: http://nomadicboys.com/gay-maldives/I generally felt that if I wanted to be totally free, to wear a bikini, drink alcohol, eat pork, etc., I’d need to be on a resort island. When you stay local you accept their rules, which fall under Sharia Law. I think the ideal vacation there would include both local and resort islands. Maldives is an amazing place that I want to Visit!! Would love to explore it soon!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-sayulita-mexico/,"13 Things to Do in Sayulita, Mexico",Mexico,"An hour northwest of Puerto Vallarta on the west coast of Mexico, Sayulita is often called pueblo mágico, or, “magic town.” It’s a lively, hip beach town full of surfers and friendly locals cruising around in golf carts.  Often recognized for the colorful art strung above the streets, Sayulita is becoming an ever more popular place to visit thanks to its laid-back atmosphere, beautiful natural setting, and abundance of cool things to do. Here are some awesome activities to try there: Sayulita is a surfer’s paradise, and is great for beginners.  Taking a surf lesson is easy and fun, especially with one of the reputable companies in town. Lunazul Surfing, for example, is one of the best in Sayulita for board rentals, surf lessons, and surfing excursions to other spots on the coast. The family-owned company has been praised by publications like Travel + Leisure and Lonely Planet for friendliness, location, equipment, accommodations, and knowledge. For a 1.5-hour lesson, prices range from $45 to $65.  The chill, laid-back atmosphere of Sayulita makes the area a great place for a yoga retreat. While there are countless retreats ranging in length all around Sayulita, I adored Haramara, where you can choose the length of your retreat, stay in gorgeous cabañas, and enjoy clean, whole food prepared for you daily. The Haramara property grounds are simply stunning and would make the perfect setting for some much-needed rejuvenation. Depending on when you go and the accommodations you prefer, prices range from $215 to $390 per night.  I attended a weeklong women’s retreat there and while I thought it was magical, it’s important to know that the villas don’t have walls. You’re totally immersed in nature and will see many birds, butterflies, and even iguanas. There’s no electricity, either, and nights are lived by lamplight. I never felt unsafe and loved the experience – get out of your comfort zone a bit!  Or, if you’re simply looking for a few yoga classes, check out Paraiso Yoga, which offers between one and four classes per day in all different yoga styles. The studio even has a cool online deal where you can purchase seven days of unlimited yoga classes for just $55, which would be perfect if you’re taking a weeklong trip to Sayulita! The Marietas Islands (Islas Marietas) are small, uninhabited islands off the coast of Nayarit, the province of which Sayulita is a part. Take a tour to the islands where you can explore clear waters, great beaches, and coves. Some tours include snorkeling and others include whale-watching, but most are only half-day excursions departing from and returning to Sayulita. One great tour company is WildMex, which offers a few different tour options to the islands.   WildMex offers another cool activity: a jungle hike. Climb Monkey Mountain for panoramic views from the summit, or hike through the jungle from Sayulita to the neighboring town of San Pancho. Either trek will allow you to get out into the beautiful natural surroundings of the area and see some cool flora, fauna, and wildlife. Plus, all the profits from these tours are used to create new trails and maintain existing ones! Book a spot on a group tour (where you’ll meet some other cool travelers) for $65.  Hop on a trusty steed and ride through the jungle as well as along the beach to explore even more of Sayulita. The horseback ride itself would be a ton of fun, plus it is a great way to get out and about! Rancho Mi Chaparrita offers both long and short rides at different times of the day, so you could go for a shady afternoon ride under the trees or  even a sunset ride along the coastline. A short tour lasting an hour and twenty minutes costs $50, while a long tour of two hours and twenty minutes costs $90.  If you’re really feeling adventurous, also take one of Rancho Mi Chaparrita’s thrilling ATV tours, where you’ll be splashing, crashing, and cruising through the ocean, jungle, and Sayulita town on a four-wheeler. A single ATV costs $85 for about a two-hour trip, complete with fruit and beverages. Beware, you might get muddy, but it’ll be one awesome ride!   Among Rancho Mi Chaparrita’s other adventures is a jungle canopy zipline tour. With 13 lines and four suspension bridges throughout the jungle, you’ll spend about two hours zipping through the treetops high above the ground. Believe it or not, Rancho Mi Chaparrita’s trip even comes with a free tequila tasting! This fun excursion costs $85 per person. Back in town, Sayulita has a ton of great shopping options. There are plenty of stores all around town with cute, unique clothing options, though they can be pricey. For more of a local feel, browsing markets can be a fun activity to get a sense of the town, starting with Sayulita’s riverside “hippie market” full of colorful, handmade goods and crafts. Stroll through rows of tables topped with fun, unique items, and pick out a pair of earrings or beach blanket to remember your trip by. On Fridays, check out the Sayulita Farmers’ Market, where local vendors sell delicious baked goods and other foods. Then, on Sundays, head over to the tianguis, another open-air market with clothing, textiles, and local artwork.   One of the best things about Sayulita is the art all around town. From the streamers hanging over little roadways branching out from the town square to the murals by talented artists, Sayulita is quirky and colorful.  I loved walking through town and finding new murals and streamers every time I went out.  Sayulita’s main beach, where the surf waves are and plenty of hawkers and bars, was not my favorite part. But you don’t have to go far to find quiet places to lay your towel down and go for a swim. I recommend turning right and walking up the beach until you find your perfect spot.  The water is a touch above lukewarm, and usually the waves aren’t too big, either.  I admit, the first thing I wanted to do upon reaching Sayulita was leave.  From what I’ve heard, it has changed a lot in the past few years and morphed from a quiet, artsy hippie town to more of a tourist spot. It’s perfect for those who want to drive around golf carts and party in bars, but that’s not me. In time I did find the quieter, more beautiful parts of town and came to enjoy the surrounding areas, but I still liked Playa San Pancho in San Francisco, just a 20 minute drive north, much better. If you want peace and tranquility and are OK with skipping the bars, head to San Pancho. I adored it.  There are several lovely beaches nearby that you can take a long, hot walk, get lucky with an Uber (there are a few around!), or cruise over with a golf cart to:  One of the best things about traveling in Mexico is the food, amiright? It’s hard to beat Mexican food, even when comparing it to the rest of the world, at least in my Southern Californian heart. I adored the food in Sayulita, particularly the following: Getting to Sayulita can be simple and straightforward, and doesn’t have to be expensive. For most people, Puerto Vallarta airport is the starting point. Though it took Sayulita a bit of time to grow on me, I came to enjoy the variety of things to do, the perfect location for a retreat, the abundant butterflies, and healthy food options. This part of Mexico has a special magic to it that is worth experiencing firsthand.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/san-francisco-mexico/,"San Francisco, Mexico, is a Dream",Mexico,"The waves crash fast on the yellow sand, stirring up flecks of gold in the green-hued Pacific. I’ve known this ocean all my life and yet never felt it so warm and inviting. It’s like the sol, and the soul too, have spent a little more time here.  I spend my days lying under the palm trees and trying to will the perfectly yellow coconuts to fall down with my mind. I haven’t been successful yet, but when I find a way, I will let you know. There are no high-rise hotels nor dazzling lights. The cell signal barely works, even in town, although there are adorable shops and delicious restaurants to keep you busy. What is it you desire? The perfect cheesecake, cactus tacos for under a dollar, or perhaps fancy fish? Just take a stroll, it feels like anything could be discoverable here.  There’s only one important thing to do, and that is to relax. Nowhere to be, no schedule to maintain, no alarm to set.  It was by chance that I ended up here. I had originally been looking at Sayulita, but upon finding nothing on the sand, cast a wider net and found a bungalow, a ten minute walk from the nearest town of San Francisco and Playa San Pancho. It’s like fate stepped in because it’s a town with ecstatic dance, happy and healthy dogs running free range, and surprise sea turtles running into the waves at dusk.  Can you think of a more perfect place to do nothing?  I wish the photo were better, but I committed to chilling so much on this trip I didn’t even bring my camera! All phone shots. BTW I have NEVER done that! Nothing but sleep, wake up to the beautiful ocean, dip in the pool when that feels right, make a banana strawberry smoothie because all of the fruit in Mexico seems to be perfectly ripe somehow, and watch as the pelicans, frigates, and a few other yellow birds I can’t name, announce the arrival of the late afternoon. Then the sun turns orange, extinguishes in the sea until another day comes and goes, and I rinse and repeat.  I wish I could write a list of ‘things to do’ here — or actually I don’t — not doing things was precisely the point. It’s like nature designed a spot that begs you to slow down. The beach isn’t too long, there aren’t signs in town advertising day tours, nobody is in shop windows calling you in to book an excursion. San Pancho is designed to be laid back, and it is delicious perfection.   How often in life are we so busy that we hardly notice when our health starts to go or our relationships suffer? How often do we, even when on vacation, actually just slow down, sleep, and have no agenda? For me, it’s a constant state of doing, and in San Pancho I did a lot more just being, and it was exactly what I needed.  If it’s exactly what you need too, I hope you come check it out. But don’t let the word get out too much, okay? Let’s just keep this little secret between you and me.  Pin me! The Airbnb I stayed in was perfect for me. It was just one room, a kitchenette, and a shared pool. The Wi-Fi didn’t work, and that was just perfect somehow. You can find it here (and get up to $55 off here). While there’s a veritable cornucopia of options, I best reduce these for you to a special few; these were my favorites: Enjoy this little gem!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/things-to-do-in-tulum/,"7 Amazing Things to do in Tulum, Mexico",Mexico,"Tulum is a dreamy, laid back beach paradise with white sands and jungle adventures. I had five days there to explore and was overwhelmed with amazing things to choose from. Now most of the time in beach destinations, I know exactly what to do – head to the sand and put on SCUBA gear, find a hammock, or search for a cold coconut. In Tulum there’s a lot more to choose from, including Mayan ruins, cenotes (caves or sinkholes that are filled in with crystal clear water) galore, various lagoons to float in, yoga, and street tacos. That last point is very important. Watch the video! It’s tough to narrow it down, but these seven amazing things to do in Tulum are some of the best, including lots of variety and deliciousness:  I had no idea until arriving in Mexico that there are roughly 1 billion cenotes to choose from. Well not really, but there are so many cenotes scattered just about everywhere that you could spend weeks only going cenote hunting. Each has a unique selling point as well – some are best for diving, others are deep in caves, and they vary in color as well. So how do you pick and choose? I asked a few of my friends who are familiar with the area to make recommendations before I went and ended up visiting five different cenotes: *By the way, I rented a car and self-drove to these cenotes, which I recommend if you’re comfortable with it. If not, this day tour will take you to several. This is a very popular one, but by arriving right when it opened at 8 AM I didn’t have to battle the crowds to enjoy this cenote. Later on in the day when I drove by, the parking lot was buzzing with cars and people. I would highly recommend getting to this one first and visiting the others on this list after.  While the cenote does feel very commercial with a big deck built on top, which initially turned me off, after spending some more time there, swimming around, and finding another little hidden area, I decided that it was quite beautiful and I do recommend visiting. Just go there early!  Out of all of the cenotes, I liked this one the best because it felt the least commercial. The baby blue water is a nice temperature and I just loved looking around the inside of the beautiful cave. In contrast to the Gran Cenote with its open ceiling, this one has a very small opening at the top and a narrow staircase down.  This is one of a trio of cenotes out near Coba,  so I visited all three because we were there anyway, right?  I was struck by how deeply blue the water is in this cenote. It also has two platforms that you can jump off of into the water. I only realized mid-fall that the higher of the two really is quite high, so make sure you’ve got your form right before you hit the water! I give my pencil dive a 7 out of 10 but let me tell you, after nursing a sore neck the next day I wish it had been a 10 out of 10! Keep the good form, people!  Out of the three cenotes near Coba, this one was the least amazing but it was also the biggest, so there’s plenty to swim around and to see. The stalactites on the ceiling are also quite impressive.  Suytun is quite a drive away from Tulum but out of all of the cenotes I visited, this one was the dreamiest-looking. The platform is partially submerged under the water and walking out to it to be illuminated by a hole in the ceiling feels like you’re walking on nature’s cat walk. I woke up at 6 AM to get to the cenote right when it opened so that I could get photos without anybody in them. I’m still not clear on whether it opens at 8 or 9 AM. They opened the gate for us at 8:20 and we were the first ones there. I think with even one or two other people in the shot it wouldn’t be nearly as special. Also, if you want to swim in the cenote you are required to wear a life jacket, which takes it off of the swimming list for me! Can’t stand wearing those orange abominations.  There are dozens of other cenotes in the vicinity of Tulum, and if you expand to the entire Yucatán peninsula, surely there are hundreds. However if you only have time to visit the ones I’ve mentioned here you will see a nice variety. Other honorable mentions include Jadin de Eden, Sac Atun, and Casa Cenote.  This Laguna looks a bit like the Blue Hole in Belize. It’s a sinkhole in the jungle with some very shallow water followed by some incredibly deep water. The deep area is roped off to swimmers but you can scuba dive into it. While it is a nice contrast to all of the cenotes, I find that it’s more interesting from the air than down on the ground. It’s a pretty cheap activity at only 50 pesos, however if you want to fly your drone there it will be an extra 300 pesos. It is unique, though, and was kind of worth it. This is another one that I visited right when it opened at 9am to get some shots of it without a bunch of people in them. It worked out. The early bird gets the worm in Tulum!  Evidence of the Mayan civilization is all over this peninsula and down into Guatemala and Belize, though the Tulum location was of significant importance to the empire as a religious and ceremonial center. The location is also stunning, set on a backdrop of the beach with dazzling blue water and white sand. While not as impressive as Tikal in Guatemala or Chichen Itza much further west, both of which are astounding due to their respective sizes, it’s certainly more convenient to check out the Tulum ruins. If you do go, make it early. I deviated from my usual plan of visiting popular attractions first thing in the morning and regretted it! By midday it is unbearably hot and I was sharing the ruins with hoards of other people. Make this one of the activities to prioritize early in the morning if you want to check out the ruins without tons of other people around.  The beach in Tulum is absolutely gorgeous with its white sands and gorgeous blue, bath temperature water. But the jungle is quite magical as well. Before moving to a beachfront hotel, I stayed in a little hut in the jungle and it was so nice falling asleep to the sounds of all of the animals, and seeing the stars so dazzling and brilliant in the sky. Plus, if you stay off of the road that goes towards Coba where many of the jungle hideaways are, you will already be on the stretch of road that leads to most of the cenotes. Spend some time in the jungle, even if it’s just wandering around at the cenotes, exploring at your resort, if they have a jungle path, or sleeping in a jungle hut.  There are so many things to do in the water in Tulum! You can do standup paddle surfing, scuba diving, snorkeling, kayaking, or hop on a catamaran. I also really like that this beach is still laid-back and there aren’t tons of high-rise hotels and constant paragliders and speedboats. There is still some peace and tranquility.  There are two kinds of food on offer in Tulum: food meant for tourists with an English menu and high prices and the little, unassuming local eateries that are more authentic and tastier, tbh. I was so excited to eat street tacos when I got to Mexico that the first thing we did, straight from the airport, was to pull over on the side of the road outside of the airport when we saw a taco stand. Street tacos are so cheap, delicious, and fresh. If you’re hesitant about the whole affair, go to a stand that has lots of patrons. It wouldn’t be super popular if it made people sick. There’s also a fantastic fruteria in the town of Tulum called Huerto del Eden with fresh juices, hand-ground coffee, plus cooked to order eggs. All of the produce is fresh from local farms, it is locally run, and the guys working there are so nice and accommodating. Plus, it’s authentic and the price matches.  Tulum is a hippie haven. It must be a combination of the area being sacred to the Mayans, the laid back atmosphere of the beach, the natural beauty, and the jungle vibes. There’s just something about it that calls the type of people who are into the spiritual side of life. If you’re curious about this kind of thing, the beach area of Tulum is the perfect place to try something new, like a cacao ceremony (this yoga studio hosts them from time to time), yoga classes, holistic health offerings and meditation classes. Just explore and see where your open mind can take you. I split my time in Tulum between a luxury hotel on the beach and a little hut in the jungle. It was perfect, and allowed me to get the best of both worlds: Hotel: The TRS Yucatan in Akumal has the dreamiest pool, a gorgeous white-sand beach, and the world’s best breakfast. I did a little tour of the breakfast spread and room in the video above. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, and it’s all inclusive without being cheesy! Jungle Hut: The Lumapi Jungle Eco Lodge is in the perfect spot if you want to visit the cenotes, plus you get a chance to fall asleep to the jungle noises and get a secluded experience – with an outdoor shower! The huts are made from materials that already exist in the jungle and they run on solar power. The owners are so lovely as well, and the vibe is just amazing. I stayed for two days and thought it was perfect. (if you’re new to Airbnb you can get a discount here) It’s possible to take collectivos, taxis, or tours, but nothing will give you the flexibility of renting a car and driving yourself. We were able to cover so much ground and to get everywhere first thing in the morning because we drove ourselves. Driving in Mexico wasn’t scary or all that different from driving in LA, where I grew up. Just go slow, drive defensively, and watch for speed bumps in the towns. Car rentals are dirt cheap (just make sure that insurance is included in your booking or they’ll try to charge you extra for it when you pick up the car!), and if you get a model that’s good on gas, it’s a cheaper alternative to tours or taxis.  Tulum is a laid back paradise in the Riviera Maya. I tend to love places like this because, well, I fit right in. This is much more my speed than the mega resorts of Cancun. Though I was heartbroken to have had to leave what felt like way too soon, I was pleased to find that there were so many things to do in Tulum. I had no idea before I went how many amazing options would be pulling me in so many directions. It’s a lovely thing to visit a place and immediately start making a list of things to do when you return, but next time with much more time on your hands. If you’re visiting Mexico, make sure Tulum is on your list. Looks like a dream location. Those caves look so colourful, would love to swim there as you suggest. Hi Kristin! I have heard on one site that you can rent a bike for free and go around the area. Can you do that? Is it free? I hang with environmentally conscious folks and they would love to know if that is possible.  Also, how much to stay in jungle huts?? That sounds really cool and economical.Kristin, such awesome advice about taco stands with lines if worried, always got great “street smart” advice. That applies to any outdoor stand I have dealt with too!  These beautiful pics showing very well the contrasts between cenotes, the conversational/personal tone, and the thoroughness of the post made it perfect to share with others I know who are interested in Mexico. Plus your suggestions of where to eat and explore match many of the tastes of those I hang out with (will be sharing this link with others). Thanks for this. You can rent a bicycle from bike rental places for about $5USD/day! It takes about 10-15minutes to bike from the town to the beach/ruins 🙂 Thanks Travel With Trang! Very helpful! I will let my friends know about this. Sounds like fun, might try this myself if I get down there one day! I called around and was also told some resorts do 30 minute bike tours as well which sounds nice (but this is even better and not everyone is into fancy resorts). Hi, I found you on MediaVine’s blog today. What time of year do you think would be best to visit to avoid crowds? Welcome! I went right before Christmas which I assume is a busy time, but was able to avoid the crowds by going to things in the early AM, so even then, it was OK! Wow I knew nothing about Tulum before reading this, come to think of it. But holy crap it sounds great! I am not opposed to renting cars, but do you know if Mexico inflates the rates for under-25s like the US does? Cause I’m not rich XD I honestly don’t know BUT the rental was super cheap overall. You get gteat rates when you land and shop around in the airport (don’t book priorly). This place looks very beautiful and I would like to have a dive into these nature made pools. Thanks for sharing this post, this is really very nice and amazing.  Tulum really does look like it’s worth a visit! Especially the cenotes look very appealing, I’ve never been to a place like that! I was in Playa del Carmen back in November and we had a cenote at our Airbnb – it was amazing! I love that whole part of Mexico, it’s just so beautiful, the food is so good and there’s so much to see and do, or, the beaches are perfect for doing absolutely nothing. Which airbnb? Love all of your articles, but this is the first time I actually get to use area specific advice! How much do you recommend planning in advance re: car rental/which company? Can I just book when I get off the plane in Cancun? Going end of February. Any issues with parking? I have little experience with rentals and am traveling solo. I booked it ahead of time with Enterprise. Just make sure you print out your credit card’s collision damage insurance if you have a travel card that provides it, and the proof of liability insurance or they’ll try to charge you extra. I think booking ahead is probably wise. Parking was no problem! I first went to Tulum ten years ago (oh my god, where did the time go??!!) and loved it then. Back then I didn’t really have any idea what I was doing or where to go or eat; it would be incredible to go back and experience it again. Love the catwalk cenote! I’m sure it has changed! But yeah it’s fun going back with more experience! Thanks for all the great tips in this article!  And your pictures are beautiful!  What about these jungle huts… where did you book this?  It sounds amazing! Airbnb! https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/16390650 It’s been more than 10 years since I visited Tulum, and while things appear to have changed since then (ahem, prices!) I’m so excited to go back! I visited a few cenotes on that trip but these are all new ones to me so hope to get to at least two or three of your suggestions. And the price of car rental is insane!! I can’t believe how cheap it is. Lol at least the car rental is cheap! Agreed, the rest was not super budget friendly. Hi! I don’t swim. Any shallow cenotes? Parts of many of them are shallow Hey Kristin, I’m about to head down there in a couple of days and I’m debating whether or not to take my drone due to some of the stories I’ve heard. Did you have any trouble with customs charging you money to take it, and/or local police/guards charging extra to use it in certain areas. Mine weighs under 1kg. Thanks I didn’t experience anything like that until I went to the Laguna mentioned in the post where they charged me 300 pesos extra to fly it. wow found this piece of advise to be great… going to tulum next week for our honeymoon and staying in Azulik.. but i cant wait to go to town for the food. I read about going to the ruins in the evening before they close that way all the tourist are out and you get to catch some beautiful sunsets…. That sounds awesome! OMG it looks amazing we will be there in 2 weeks! I cant wait! Can I ask where you rented your car from? I’ve been researching and while the rental itself is insanely cheap the insurance isn’t and apparently required. It comes to about $300 to $400 USD with all insurances for a week. Is that about what you paid? So what you’ll want to do is book with a credit card that has collision insurance and print it out to bring with you. I also booked a car with enterprise via Expedia that said ‘insurance included’, which I printed out as well, so I was able to get away with not paying any extras except for the extra driver. They always get you on something I guess. Hey Kristin! I’m going to Tulum on Sunday and plan on renting a car. Do you have any suggestions on where to rent from? And do you recommend renting online beforehand or just waiting until I get there? I rented with Enterprise and I’d book ahead of time and show them that you already have insurance, and use a credit card that also has rental insurance and print that out to bring along too. They’re notorious for trying to charge for that. Hello! Just looking to plan our trip to Yucatan/Quintana Roo area for 4 weeks. I’m sooo keen on Tulum as it seems like such my vibe. What would you recommend to be a good amount of time to spend here? Thanks! Wow 4 weeks! Nice! give it a week or a little more then. There’s so much to do there and I much preferred it to the other areas like Cancun and Playa del Carmen. Thanks so much for all this great info! I am heading to Tulum at the end of the week and this post was so helpful and all your photos are so dreamy! Yay have fun! Hey gal, where did you rent the car? Cheapest one I see online is Orbitz but I read so. Many bad reviews I’m scared to give my credit card details… I rented at Enterprise and they’re all bad about trying to get you to pay more, but come with proof of coverage printed out and it’ll be hard for them to prove you need more. What GPS do you like to use when you are driving outside of the US? I’m concerned about extra phone charges if I use google maps or waze. I almost always get local SIM cards but you can also download offline maps while you’re still at home. Maps.me is okay. Kristin, This was so helpful – thank you! Did you pay only in pesos for the centoes, food, etc. or were you able to use a credit card? Do any of the excursions you listed need to be booked in advance? What did you do with your valuables when swimming at the cenotes to keep them safe and dry? I did just pay in pesos. Most places do not take card outside of the resorts. I self drove to all of the excursions so I just showed up! I didn’t take valuables to the cenotes but you could use a dry bag. Hope that helps! Kristin, Thanks for the great article. I am going on my first solo trip next week and will be spending couple days in Tulum.1) any place i can just show up for a bike ride? (jungle /coba/cenote/caves)2) If i just show up to the cenote places do i join a group their or have to go solo?3) Also plan on exploring Avenida Kukulkan, Sian Ka’an Biosphere4) how do i join a group(s) rather going solo?5) any  tip?  Thanks, Hi Priyank,1) I’m not really sure about riding bikes. I don’t think so but maybe there are bike tours?2) You’d go solo in that case3) Cool!4) I’d look online for groups you’d like to join or ask at your hotel if there’s a day tour you can join if you’d rather not go alone. There are bike (bicycle) shops and i tried booking in Tulum, but it requires 2 people minimum. Don’t think i want to ride bike myself in Jungle or unknown places.  any websites do you recommend for me to find groups prior to my arrival? Where or how do you recommend renting a car? Should I get one from Cancun airport or the hotel? I rented from the cancun airport. Hi Kristin, nice article. We will be visiting Tulum for the day (staying in Puerto Morelos) Getting a tour van for 9 people (4 adults and 5 kids – ages 9-12) .  1) Is there a tour company you recommend – the cheapest we found for the day was $345 USD.2) Is there any places near Tulum where we could bring the kids to see jungle wild life? Like a preserve or something? Thanks, Ryan I might just self drive if it were me. Tulum  is more about the cenotes than wildlife as far as I found. I’m planning a trip to Tulum in a few weeks and some of the photos you shared are amazing! I’m wondering what you used for some of them- are there normally good vantage points that you can get photos from, or did you need to use a drone type of thing? Especially for the last picture, so beautiful! I have a drone! Thanks for the kind words 🙂 Hey! I’m planning on going to tulum for only a short time, and wanted to take a day to visit cenotes. How many did you get to see in one day if you started at 8am? And how long did it take you to visit them overall? Also, were you able to bring snacks, water, etc.? You could self drive to 5-6 of them if you wish! If you do it all day then even more. There’s an area with 3 all in the same spot as well which you can see in the video and noted in the post. Yes, I brought water and usually did roadside tacos when on adventures 🙂 Hi, your article makes me want to visit tomorrow! Are there any issues drinking the water or eating the food? Definitely don’t drink the tap water, but I had no issues with the food! Hello Kristin, your article is so helpful! We’re going to Tulum in two weeks. We’re going to help watch our granddaughter and pregnant daughter.  I have two questions though.1) We’re going to float the canals and I can’t quit thinking about alligators! Is there any concern of them in the canals?2) Do you know if a 23 month child is allowed to float the canals? She’d have a proper flotation device.I’d appreciate any information to calm my fears!Thank you,Sharon P Hmm, not sure I heard about any canals? Might want to ask the locals about that one. Hi Kristin!My fiance and I couldn’t decide where to take our honeymoon in January and literally decided on Tulum based on this post. So thanks for making the decision for us!  Quick question – the jungle huts – is it more of a hostel-like environment or are the jungle huts pretty private? We’re thinking of doing a few nights there and a couple nights at the resort. Thanks so much!! The jungle huts are totally private, with your own toilet. They just aren’t fancy. It’s jungly so there are bugs (that bothered my friend, lol) and it’s very humid, but I loved it! Hi! Quick question: I’ve never been to Mexico! Do you suggest that my first 3-4 day trip should be reserved for just Tulum? is it worth seeing other places first e.g. Cancun and the rest e.g. Mexico City? Also is Cancun Airport the closest one? Thanks! If it’s only 3-4 days then I’d definitely just stay in the Tulum area. Yes Cancun is the closest airport. Have fun! Hey! Where’s that wonderful beach you recommended?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/borneo-travel-budget/,Tips from the Banker: The Cost of Travel in Malaysian Borneo,Malaysia,"I had heard that Malaysia is not a cheap country to visit, at least as compared to the rest of Southeast Asia.  While I tend to disagree as it pertains to Peninsular Malaysia, where I only spent an average of USD$37 per day, I had different feelings as it pertains to a Malaysian Borneo travel budget. Part of Borneo’s allure is the clean beaches and well-preserved national parks.  Though the rain forest has largely been depleted to make way for palm oil plantations, the mountains, dive sites, and other natural tourist attractions are kept clean and beautiful due to the limited number of tourists allowed to visit each day coupled with the high cost associated with such activities. With that in mind, please consider that the cost of visiting Malaysian Borneo will certainly vary wildly from person to person, depending on what it is that you want to do. Please also keep in mind that I only visited Sabah, Borneo’s northern state. My overall cost per day, averaging out my activities, was $62/day, making this my most expensive Southeast Asian destination yet. Here’s the breakdown: The cheapest I encountered was in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah’s largest city, where the cost for a dorm was $8/night.  The most expensive ran more like $20/night at the tip of Borneo.  A stay on one of the islands off of Semporna in the south will run more like $25/night for a dorm. Borneo isn’t like Thailand or Vietnam, where you can count on walking in and finding a bed for the night, so I’d recommend booking your accommodation in advance. In some places, because of the scarcity of dorms, you are better off paying a bit more and get a private room to yourself. Hostels in Kota Kinabalu: $7-$14 (book your hostel in Kota Kinabalu here) Hostels in Kuching: $5-$12 (book your hostel in Kuching here) Hostels in Sandakan: $9 (book your hostel in Sandakan here)  Getting to Borneo only cost me $18, thanks to the cheap flights offered by Air Asia. I cannot stress enough that when visiting Malaysia, signing up for Air Asia’s flight alerts is a very smart move. They regularly have deals like this and are a fairly well-known and reliable airline. Download Grab, which is Southeast Asia’s version of Uber, and use it to get around town. The service is available in all major towns in Borneo, and typically cost 20%-30% cheaper than regular taxis. Buses cost about the same as in Peninsular Malaysia at around $7-$20 per one-way trip, depending on distance. As always, booking directly at the bus station kiosk resulted in significant savings.  Motorbike rental came out to about $15 per day, plus the cost of fuel. Food was about the same in Borneo as it was in Peninsular Malaysia, at around $2-$5 for a decent meal.  Beer was also around the same price at $3 for a can.  Sadly, the food was not as amazing as in Peninsular Malaysia, which I would attribute to the smaller number of minorities in Malaysian Borneo.  I didn’t see much Indian food, but found lots of Halal and Chinese food. This was a tough one to write as Borneo has the potential to be cheap if all you do is eat, sleep, and move around on public buses.  Therein lies my conundrum – almost nobody comes to Borneo to do just that. This is the island where people come to climb mountains, go white water rafting, SCUBA dive, view Orangutans, and other various expensive activities. For example, to climb Mt. Kinabalu, one of Borneo’s foremost attractions, the typical cost to book ahead is around $300-$400 to stay in the lodge, hire a guide (compulsory) and pay the park fees. Another example is SCUBA diving in Sipadan, Borneo’s most famous dive site.  Sipadan commands high fees as only a fixed number of divers may dive there each day, and permits tend to get booked weeks or even months in advance.  For three nights of accommodation on Mabul Island, food, dive gear, and the 9-dive Sipadan dive package, I was set back about $500.  Ouch! A local SIM card with $2 credit and 5 gigs of data cost about $10. Celcom apparently has the widest coverage in Borneo. Local lifestyle is relatively laidback and simple, so other than the outdoor activities, I didn’t really spend a lot of money on other things. Organized tours can be pretty expensive, so I tried to avoid them. Did I do Malaysian Borneo in the cheapest way possible? Of course not! There were some things that I did in the cheaply – like climbing Mt. Kinabalu in one day (no longer an option), which saved me hundreds, and some things I spent a load of money on. Had I not chosen to dive in Sipadan, I would have been able to get my costs closer to the 30s per day – my usual goal.  That said, it was worth every penny and I enjoyed myself immensely. Sometimes, breaking the budget is necessary for a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Completely agree with your assessment of costs in Malaysian Borneo vs peninsular Malaysia, as we felt exactly the same way. Sabah & Sarawak are both beautiful provinces but the cost for activities in order to enjoy them is really very high—we weren’t ever interested in doing Kinabalu, but we did dive in Sipadan and also did a multi-day river safari out of Sandakan (largely because actual rainforest treks were way out of our budget). It seemed like Sarawak had some mildly cheaper options in terms of activities, but it does seem that for any of the big things, you’ll likely have to pay $500 minimum. We also found that getting around Sabah was such a lengthy process, though we were lucky to get some pretty cheap flights there as well as in Sarawak which helped cut our travel time down quite a bit without totally busting our budget. It would have certainly been cheaper to just bus it, but we had limited time and didn’t want to waste an entire day getting from point to point. It is super expensive. It was fun renting motorbikes and getting around that way.  Air asia is also nice and cheap if you can get tickets when they release cheap flight alerts.  I also found a way to climb Mt. Kinabalu for much cheaper. Overall, though, it cost me more than anywhere else! Hi KristinWhat is the cheapest way to climb Mt Kinabalu?Phil These days there’s not much of an option other than the standard overnight. Book directly, in person, rather than through an agent and you’ll pay less. I’ll always break the budget for a once in a lifetime experience!! Glad you got to dive Sipadan…I have heard such great things about it. It was worth the cost. I want to go back and do it again, it was so amazing! I desperately want to dive Sipadan! Really is quite a lot compared to other parts of Southeast Asia but as you said, worth every penny! The photos look lush. I’ve heard so many good things about Borneo and a lot about how much it costs. Good to see the actual cost laid out so thanks for an informative read. It sounds like it’s really worth stretching the budget for a few days to visit! Pleasure to read… I am visiting Borneo next summer… Could you recommend any dive resorts/hotels? Best regardsStanis SCUBA Junkie on Mabul was great for Sipadan. Please be aware now that it is not regarded safe to visit these islands as there is a high terrorism threat, we had to change our plans and are diving in the perhentian Islands nowhere published this so we came very close to booking with scuba junkie highs I thought sounded great but the British foreign office now recommends against ALL travel to this area. Hi Emma, there had been a recent attack when I was there too, but they didn’t target tourists and it honestly didn’t affect me at all. It happens all the time there and it’s really not a big deal. Same thing when I went to Mindanao in the Philippines. If you saw the island of Mabul I think you’d see how silly any terrorists would be to bother targeting it. It’s tiny and very out of the way. Hey, awesome blog and informative information. I just want to ask you few questions as I’m thinking about visiting Sabah especially KK area. First of all; let me tell you my story, I’m a university student in Selangor I have a 3-week vacation at the end of February. My friends pushed me to travel with them to Langkawi, I never been there but I wasn’t really excited because I know Langkawi is a very touristy place and I don’t like that, yet I know it will be awesome so yeah I agreed. However; I always wanted to climb Mt. Kinabalu and I’m thinking after coming from my trip in Langkawi to travel to Sabah just KK area to make the expenses the least for like 5 days.  I’d like to climb Mount Kinabalu in one day and I don’t what other things I shall go for in Kota Kinabalu, I know there are number of Islands there, but is it worth to go after spending 5 days in langkawi? I have one more question, could I limit my budget in Kota Kinabalu (Excluding the climb) to 100 Malaysian Ringgits per day? (maybe 650 Ringgit  for the whole five days with the climb?) In KK I think you could do 100 ringgit per day, but you wouldn’t be able to do many activities.  I think I spent 5 days in Langkawi. It’s nice to get a car and drive it around the island. Have fun! Get the malaysian rates it’s wayyyyy cheaper. I haven’t climb Mt.K just yet but for a Bruneian to climb it can cost me close to RM1.5K ..as for a malaysian can be as low as RM600.. If you know somebody in KK.. you’ll probably be spending less than that! Well, first you probably need to not be a foreigner. Borneo was our most expensive destination in SE Asia as well! We ended up doing the Kinabalu climb in one day, which was painful but AMAZING:  And we saved some money by organizing most of the wildlife viewing on our own But Sipadan pretty much blows the budget no matter how you cut it! I was just curious where did you stay or package did you buy to get that 3 night Sipadan diving package for 500$? SCUBA Junkie Thanks for the info about scuba junkie. It’s hard to find cheap price for Sipadan package. Totally agreed with you the price there is much more expensive than west malaysia. Btw we just started a travel blog, hope  can drop by and give feed back 🙂 Wow! I love scuba diving. For sure the island is great. Seeing the clear water and the amazing view underwater makes me want to go there and get on my scuba gears. Nice post. I love it too! Borneo is an excellent place for it When i saw this post,i feel sad as i am born and raised in Borneo who working in Penisular Malaysia. It is sad that every single activities even food is more expensive because of government taken most of the income of Borneo to build their most beautiful cities in penisular. The scene may not be the most beautiful to some traveler, but i am still miss all part of it. It is more expensive, but I still really enjoyed my time there and thought it was beautiful. The activities like diving and climbing Kinabalu were amazing as well and I still remember them fondly! This post was really useful! I have a couple of weeks to kill before I need to be back in Manila and I’m trying to find somewhere close by. It’s a shame things do appear to be quite pricey here, but with some of your tips I’ll save a lot! It’s definitely more than the other places I’ve visited in Southeast Asia but it’s definitely still a budget destination Thank you so much for the updates and for the tips!  Only thing is I would say Sipadan is super worth the splurge! That was almost 4 years ago for me and it’s still one of the highlights of all of my travels. Traveled down the rejang river from Kuching in Sarawak to Sibu and then to kapit and finally Belaga.  Great river trip .Very inexpensive.  We then traveled overland to kota kinabalu. Great travel experience.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/malaysia-travel-budget/,Tips From the Banker: The Real Cost of Travel in Peninsular Malaysia,Malaysia,"Rumors abound about the cost of backpacking through Malaysia.  Everyone can agree that Laos and Cambodia, as well as Northern Thailand, are pretty cheap. Nearly everyone also agrees that the Thai islands are much more expensive, especially in high season.  Malaysia, however, had me hearing all kinds of different reports. After spending a solid month backpacking through Peninsular Malaysia (read: excluding Borneo – read about that here), I can now attest that a Malaysia travel budget does not have to break the bank.  In fact, I ended up spending more in Thailand! I averaged about $37/day.  Here’s the breakdown: Time and time again I think fondly of the days when I spent $2-$4 on a dorm bed in Laos or Cambodia.  Those days are long gone, and simply not possible in Malaysia.  I spent about $6 – $14 per night on an average dorm bed. Some places included a “breakfast” of bread and tea/coffee, which I skipped most of the time. Given the huge variety of affordable local breakfasts, I wouldn’t bother checking if breakfast is included. While I could have gone for cheaper accommodation in places like Kuala Lumpur, for example, I loved the comfort, social atmosphere, and amazing customer service of places like Reggae Mansion (who really helped me out of a bind when I left my passport there on accident) too much to pass them up.  I tend to pay more when there’s the promise of a good social atmosphere, given that I’m a solo traveler. Hostels in Kuala Lumpur: $5-$12 (book your hostel in Kuala Lumpur here) Hostels in Georgetown: $5-$15 (book your hostel in Georgetown here) Hostels in Cameron Highland: $6-$8 (book your hostel in Cameron Highland here)  Public transportation in Malaysia is affordable and generally reliable. In Kuala Lumpur, you can easily get around via trains and even free buses. Intercity buses and trains typically cost about $10-$15 for a one-way ride. Always check the domestic flights as they can get very cheap!  Your best bet is to sign up for Air Asia flight alerts.  They send out bi-weekly emails with various deals around Asia and Oceania, resulting in my flights costing well under $20 each time I wanted to fly somewhere instead of taking hours upon hours to bus it instead. Download Grab, which is Southeast Asia’s version of Uber, and use it to get around town, especially if you are heading out at night. The regular taxis in Malaysia are known to not use a meter and charge exorbitant fees on tourists, so I’d avoid them at all cost. *When flying Air Asia, try your very best not to have to check a bag.  Uncheck the options for trip insurance, meals on board, and pre-picking your seats when booking online.  All of these things will stack up the fees quickly.  Food is just as cheap in Malaysia as it is anywhere in Southeast Asia, and it’s delicious! Street food is plenty easy to find, and one can easily leave with a full belly at a cost of just a few dollars. Drinks, however, will eat up one’s budget extremely quickly in Malaysia.  Beer runs almost at the same cost as it does in a Western country due to high taxes in this Muslim country.  With a few duty-free exceptions, such as Langkawi, one can expect to spend upwards of USD $4 per beer and even more for mixed drinks. Malaysia is not a party destination in the way that other countries in Southeast Asia are.  That said, the social scene is still quite good, and there’s certainly more to a place than the availability of cheap booze. Langkawi stood out as cheap for those looking to drink and be merry.  Otherwise, there were no obvious cheap vs. expensive places.  Kuala Lumpur would probably end up at the costly end of the spectrum were the higher costs for accommodation not offset by the cheapness of getting around on local transport. A local SIM card costs about $9 and comes with 6 gigs of data. Coverage is strong and stable. Activities can really add up in Malaysia.  While diving in Perhentian Island was actually pretty cheap at around $100 for 5 dives, other activities were quite expensive. Going to the top of the famous Petronas Towers, for example, ran about $20, so I skipped it.  The Batu Caves just outside of KL, however, were free to visit. Organized tours also ran pretty steep, but I always avoid those.  In general, going your own route, as I did in Cameron Highlands, saves a lot of money. All in all, Malaysia can be done cheaply, and is well worth a visit! *I should also note that I saved a bit of money by attending events with locals who were quite amazing hosts.  I attribute much of my amazing stay to them and their generosity.   Great article! I envy you! I’m planning to travel through Asia in the future, hope my dream will come true.Good luck to you! I once met a guy who spent something like $5000 in a single month in Thailand. He kept saying “oh, you can’t get cheap places like you used to. Nowadays it’s like $10 a night or something.” We kept pressing him to add up his day-to-day costs before he finally admitted he was spending like $100 a day on…substances of some sort or another. Excluding alcohol. Lesson learned: Never listen to people who say travel has to be super expensive. Haha, yep that’ll do it! Great advise Kristin! I am headed to Malaysia on my travels so will keep this in mind! Enjoy it, Michelle! I absolutely adored Malaysia. This is helpful! I need to bookmark this page as I’m planning to visit Malaysia at the end of this year. Let me know what you think of it.  I had a blast there! Labuan and Tiomen Island are two other of these tax free havens! Labuan off Kota Kinabalu and Brunei is significantly less touristy (not really a marketed ‘tropical island’) and the city quite developed so it is an amazing duty free shopping experience. Beers go for as little as 2.5 RM and bottles of spirits upwards of 15 RM. I actually visited Labuan. Not a lot to do there but it’s true that drinks, and chocolate, are cheaper. It was reported in the local Malaysian newspapers that Raggae Mansion has a policy of not allowing people from Malaysia, India and the Middle East from staying at the hostel: http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx/?file=%2f2011%2f11%2f5%2fnation%2f9843162&sec=nation If you do decide to stay there again, you might want to see if they still practice such discrimination. That’s true, they do not allow locals to stay there.  This is also true in many places in Indonesia and elsewhere in Malaysia. I’m not really sure what to do about that as it’s often unknown to me until I’ve already stayed there. It’s often locals even discriminating against other locals. I understand your dilemma. I guess all that can be done is to stay at other establishments the next time you are in town. And perhaps not promoting the place in your blog? You don’t seem like the kind of person who would condone such practices. It was surprisingly cheap after Singapore. And I kept comparing the prices of my daily expenses in Kuala Lumpur with the prices I had to pay in Western Europe. It was tremendously cheaper, not at all less interesting to visit.Malaysia is adorable and affordable. Agreed I’m a big fan of Malaysia Hi! Specifically which places did you visit? Also, in your opinion, would you recommend Peninsular Malaysia or Borneo? Thanks in advance! I’d recommend both! Here’s a map with all of the places I went and corresponding blog posts: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/malaysia-guide/ I am a Malaysian, about the sim card you mention, you can get the cheaper card at a random telecommunication shop, it cost about RM20 but you need to pay for the internet separately,  it have many option depend on how many gbs you need. FYI it is easy to connect to free wifi (in restaurant/cafe/hotel) all you have to do is to ask the waiter what is the wifi password. Thanks for the suggestion! I’m glad to know there’s a cheaper option. I don’t dive, but snorkel. I ended up basing myself in Semporna and did day trips out to snorke the different islands. Was way cheaper than doing a snorkel package. Always is! The date line on this article and others on your site is 2018.  Yet comments are from 2013.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/places-to-visit-in-malaysia/,The Best Places to Visit in Malaysia: A Full Itinerary,Malaysia,"When I backpacked around Southeast Asia back in 2013, I had low expectations for Malaysia – it was not the most popular or talked about stop on the Banana Pancake Trail. However, Malaysia ended up having so much to offer, it baffles me why it’s not as hyped a backpacking destination as its neighbors. Malaysia is a unique country where you get to see different ethnicities coming together, living in harmony for the most part. The food is amazing and I honestly don’t think I’ve even tried half of what it has to offer during my six-week stay in Malaysia. I visited temples of different religions, had the best diving experience of my life, and trekked to the highest hike-able peak in Southeast Asia. If someone tells you to give Malaysia a pass, don’t believe them. Here’s my guide to 17 of the best places to visit in Malaysia, starting from the Peninsula, from north to south (which could be easily reversed if you are coming from the other direction), followed by crossing over to Borneo. Some of the suggestions on this itinerary are well known and some are off the typical backpacking radar: The state that borders Thailand is often shadowed by its popular neighbor. However, Kedah has its own charm. More and more locals now operate traditional Malay house style guesthouses that are surrounded by vast paddy fields, so if you want a rustic, authentic Malaysian experience, Kedah is worth stopping in for a night or two before heading over to Langkawi. Maximize your short time here by asking the friendly locals where the best food spots are, and check out one of the grandest and oldest mosques in Malaysia, the Zahir Mosque. Stay: Tamteh Homestay From Kedah, take a 2-hour ferry ride to Langkawi, an island popular with the locals for its duty-free shopping. The main island is one of the more commercialized islands in Malaysia, but a cheap island hopping trip (which costs less than $15) will take you to the surrounding islands with crystal clear water and beautiful beaches. My tip is to stay on Cenang beach, as it is where all the good food is, but spend your time on the surrounding islands during the day. You can also take a day hike to the Temurun waterfall and hang out with the friendly locals. The cable car is also a fun way to see Langkawi from high above. Read more about Langkawi here. Stay: Langkawi Dormitory or Pondok Keladi George Town is a foodie paradise. The amount and variety of good food is almost overwhelming, so here are a few must-tries: Char Kuey Teow – these golden stir fry noodles are paired with juicy prawns, bean sprouts, eggs, and greens. The best one is from this roadside stall located at the corner of Siam Road and Anson Road. Expect long queues, mainly from the locals – which is always a good sign! Laksa – Another noodle dish but with broth that is sour, spicy, and slightly sweet at the same time. Many would go to the popular stall located next to Kek Lok Si, but a local favorite is Laksa Bisu, located at Annex Market. Rojak – Basically a salad, but with crackers, fruits, nuts, and catch this: a thick sauce made of shrimp paste, chili, and lots of sugar. Cendol – a local favorite dessert, cendol is a humble bowl of shaved ice, kidney beans, condensed milk, and flavored flour noodles. It may sound strange but it’s perfect on a scorching hot day, though the best one located at the back alley of Lebuh Keng Kwee would require you to stand under the scorching hot sun while savoring it. When you are stuffed to the point that eating is no longer possible, which I experienced often in Malaysia, take a walk along the streets of George Town and hunt for the Insta-worthy street art curated by Lithuanian artist, Ernest Zacharevic, or check out the beautiful Kek Lok Si, as well as the Peranakan mansions. Stay: I really liked my stay at Reggae Penang. Unfortunately, it’s now permanently closed. The Frame Guesthouse is strategically located and offers both dorms and private rooms. For a more luxurious stay, check out Eastern & Oriental Hotel   Many visitors to Malaysia have heard of Taman Negara, the most popular national park on the Peninsula. It’s vast and filled with various flora and fauna, and a wonderful spot for the adventurous. However, for something that is off the beaten path, check out Royal Belum State Park located in Perak, right below George Town. It offers a remote wilderness of about 117,500 hectares, and while getting there could be a challenge, it is worth every effort. You could swim in the lake, trek through the 130 million year old forest, and admire one of the biggest flowers in the world, the Rafflesia (from a distance, because they smell like horse piss, no really). If you are coming from George Town, there are daily buses that depart for Gerik town, and from there, your lodge will pick you up, or you can take a taxi. Stay: Belum Rainforest Resort I remember feeling grateful for the cold temperatures in Cameron Highlands, a great escape from a typically hot and humid Southeast Asia. Cameron Highlands is very touristy, but there are always ways to escape the crowds. Trek through the jungle, look for a quiet strawberry farm, and opt for the less popular tea plantations, and you are good to go! Stay: I really enjoyed my stay at De’Native! It’s in the forest with great atmosphere. I loved the beaches on Perhentian, and I loved the diving experience even more. There are two islands, namely the small Perhentian, and the big Perhentian. The small one leans toward backpackers, whereas the big one leans toward resorts and hotels. Regardless of which island you end up on, the island hopping trip takes you to the same spots surrounding Perhentian. You can also take a boat ride to the even quieter Lang Tengah and Kapas island. The atmosphere on both islands are laid back and peaceful, which is what I like about them. Stay: Camp at Rainforest Camping or a jungle safari tent (use this code to get discount!) At first sight, KL looks just like any other city with its traffic, shopping malls, and skyscrapers. However, you only need to dig a little bit deeper to experience the real Kuala Lumpur. Here are some tips: instead of Jalan Alor and Chinatown, fill your tummy at Pudu’s ICC hawker food centre and Connaught garden food market (both accessible by Uber); instead of the mandatory shot in front of the Petronas Towers, check out the many rooftop bars with unblocked views of the entire city; for a fun night out, forget Changkat, go to TREC; to get away from the hustle and bustle, there’s an hour-long trek at Apek Hill, a local favorite. Finally, if you have the time, go watch a movie in any local cinema. After all, where else can you find three language subtitles on one screen? Stay: I have fond memories of Reggae Mansion Kuala Lumpur though it is a party place. Tuxedo KL offers a rooftop view of the city AND an infinity pool. Just two hours away from Kuala Lumpur, Chemerung is a beautiful, hidden waterfall tucked away in Terengganu.Chemerung waterfall is well over 300 meters tall with foaming waters cascading from the skies above, slipping down the craggy mountainside and pooling in the basins of rock below. That sounds like a good place to be, right? Check out this guide for more on how to get there. Stay: campsites are available if you are planning on trekking for 9 hours to the top. Here’s another cool spot that’s lesser known to tourists. The Dusun is a tropical rainforest resort located in Seremban, just about an hour away from the international airport. There are a total of 7 houses each with a different theme, surrounded by 4000 acres of virgin forest. Prices start at about $100 per night, which can be shared by 2 people. It’s great for couples or a group of friends. If you are traveling solo, ask around and see if someone would like to come along! Stay: The Dusun Some may compare Malacca to George Town, as both are heavily colonial influenced and offer delicious street food. However Malacca has more of a small-town vibe compared to George Town, and it is worth the visit. Street food wise, it’s famous for Portuguese egg tarts, chicken rice balls, Satay Celup, and coconut shakes. But as always, dig a little bit deeper and you will find some local favorites off the tourist radar: Putu Piring: a hemispherical snack made of coconut shreds and filled with coconut sugar. The best one is home made by an old couple at their house – 252, Jalan Tengkera. Cockles: Don’t be put off by the humble stall right next to a drain (the stall’s name translates as “drain cockles”). Take a seat and order a plate of fresh cockles and clams and slurp away with the local foodies – Longkang Siham, Jalan Bunga Raya, Madam King. Durian Cendol: If you have yet to give the infamously stinky Durian a try, start with a Durian cendol! Then you can decide which side you belong (personally I’m a lover and advocate of it)- 115, Jalan Merdeka. Taibak: A traditional Nyonya cold dessert, this is a mixture of shaved ice, pandan infused syrup, rice flour noodles, and black grass jelly cubes – the stall is right next to Wesley Methodist Church. Stay: Nomaps offers nice and clean dorms. This spacious suite costs only about $70 per night! From Malacca, you can take a bus that departs daily to Mersing Jetty, and take a boat to yet another off the beaten path place on the Peninsula – Tioman Island. Perhaps due to the country’s Islamic culture, Malaysian islands exude a laid back, peaceful atmosphere, as opposed to the party vibe of many Thai islands. On Tioman Island, restaurants open and close as they like, and there are more basic huts with no WiFi or water heaters (A.K.A. perfection) than resorts. Scuba diving is fantastic, as you can potentially see sharks, turtles, and colorful corals. It is also a great place to get your diving license, so you can explore deeper in the next stops! Stay: A beachfront, simple chalet is always a good idea. Santai Bistro Resort costs less than $50 per night. Pemangil Island is possibly the Peninsula’s best kept secret (and here I am, letting it out…). It’s an incredible place to snorkel or dive in, the water is amazing, the beach is nice and clean, and the last time I checked, there’s only one resort on the island. Rock cliff climbing is a popular sport here. The locals are also happy to show you around the village, and you will get a glimpse of how the locals live. This is one heck of a climb, but oh-so worth it! I did it in one day but unfortunately this is no longer permitted. A minimum of 2D1N is now required to climb to the peak of Mount Kinabalu, however this allows you to arrive at the peak at sunrise, which must be an unforgettable treat. I wrote about my personal experience, and updated it with the latest information on how to get there and what to expect. Stay: I stayed at Kinabalu Mountain Lodge, which is only 2km from the park entrance. This is yet another diving paradise of many in Malaysia, but trust me, this one is officially one of the best dive sites in the world, according to multiple sources including CNN Travel. I can also attest, given that after completing 150 dives, I still rank Sipadan right at the top of my best diving experiences. Sipadan limits daily divers and requires a permit to dive, so book in advance – I’d suggest at least one month ahead, or just as soon as you’ve booked your flight tickets to Sabah. Another tip is to stay on Mabul, where you get to see the sea gypsea tribe. Stay: I dived and stayed with Scuba Junkie, and loved my experience with them. If you don’t mind staying a bit further away, look for accommodation options in Semporna. This is the farthest island from Kota Kinabalu, perfect for those in search of an off the beaten path adventure. It is the least visited island of the 5, and offers little to no facilities on the island. Spending a few hours on Sulug should make you wonder if you are made for the Robinson Crusoe life. Stay: While most people do day trips to Sulug, you can also camp on the island. This is a tricky one to get to, but well worth the effort (have you noticed the pattern?). From Kinabalu, you can take a 6-hour long bus to Sandakan, the second largest town in Sabah. As most private cruise companies and lodges offer transfers, there’s virtually no public transport available to Sukau (closest town to the river) other than a minibus that leaves after lunch time daily. As for the river cruise, there are a few companies offering 1-3 days trips. Most lodges double up as cruise companies, which make things easier. Stay: for something more affordable and rustic, check out Lodge Paganakan Dii Tropical Retreat (less than $50 per night). Nature Lodge Kinabatangan is the most popular accommodation in that area. I still remember the beaches at the Tip of Borneo fondly, with their white sand, little purple flowers, incredibly clear blue water, and not another soul or a single piece of trash in sight. It’s an underrated beauty without many other tourists, but it’s so worth checking out. You can get yourself there by renting a motorbike in Kota Kinabalu. Stay: There were just about 3 or 4 guesthouses around when I was there in 2013, but you can now pick from a few resorts as well as Airbnbs. Sipadan is super high on my list for the next trip to Malaysian Borneo! I can also really recommend Mulu National Park. It’s a great place for hiking and caving 🙂 Sipadan is mind blowing! Thanks for this thorough brochure on what to see and do in Malaysia. Such a pretty country with amazing beaches and gorgeous waterfalls and lush mountains. Definitely on the list if I can get over to that part of the world, especially if it is more low-key. One thing I have heard from people who travel to SE Asia is that the people in Malaysia are so warm and friendly…willing to give their shirt off their back, literally! The few I have had the benefit to encounter in my own life have fit this description. That is a pull for me. The multiculturalism is another wonderful thing. As for Pemangil Island, your secret is safe with me! What island?? One question about the cable car, how steep a drop is it? It looks really scenic when the sky is clear! One other thing that I learned recently about the monsoon season from a Malaysian friend (and then I did more research based on this person’s valuable info since I love weather and want to understand it) is that it is really complicated. They have two of them, the Southwest monsoon from Australia and the Northeast monsoon from China (complicated enough with just one!) with the latter bigger and occurring now (Oct-March), the other (April-Sept). Supposedly the “West Coast” is drier in “April-Oct” and the “East Coast” is drier in “April-Sept”. Well, right now it is pouring in the “West Coast” and it is January! But then there are strings of sunny, hot, and humid days. Then there are typhoons and La Nina/El Nino, climate change, etc. that complicate it and might make it dry even during the wet season.  So it can rain hard anytime and be dry anytime. My point is that there are so many sites saying when “it is good to visit Malaysia” or “SE Asia” in terms of weather (it might be more informative though for more northern areas like Laos and Cambodia where the dry and wet season are more defined) . My suggestion is to perhaps disregard them, keep tabs of the weather like you would anywhere else, go to Malaysia when you can, it is a beautiful country and to be honest, I don’t mind the rainfall if it relieves you from the heat (it is humid all the time, better with the temperatures lower! Okay don’t want flooding of course).  Another nice thing about the tropics, it can be pouring in one town all day and it be fine in the next. I guess a better way to judge what time of year to go is based on things like lighter or heavier tourist seasons (ignorant on this one regarding when that is) and when it is convenient for you! If anyone here thinks I am way off here, let me know. I really want to understand it!! Sorry, messed up there, I meant to say “the “West Coast” is supposedly DRIER from OCTOBER to MARCH.” Wow great resource! I will admit I have never really thought about Malaysia too much. You’re right, it’s right by Thailand so I imagine often gets overshadowed. Now I’m trying to figure how to work Malaysia into my budget along with all the other places I wanna go lol It’s a bit more expensive than the surrounding countries (except for Singapore which is a pretty penny) but so nice and gorgeous and with fewer other travelers, but I found that the people I met there were the right kind of travelers. Just awesome! This is a nice place to travel to Malaysia. Perhentian Islands is a nice place I want to visit this place soon. So many great destination ideas! Even though I have already had mine, I still like to get to know some nice destinations, even for holidays with my wife. I would also add one more place that we really like to visit, Bali in Indonesia. I love Indonesia! I have a similar post here https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/indonesia-itinerary/ Hi indeed great plan shared I am visiting Malaysia on businesses trip for 20days and my stay in KL is booked ,how long should I plan for langkawi island can i do it over weekend ? I’d say yes. Hi Kristin! I’ve read your blog for awhile but never commented. Planning two weeks in Malaysia (coming from Singapore and going to Thailand) and I think I only have time for either Tioman or the Perhentians… I know this is an impossible question but do you have a recommendation as to which I should visit? I love beaches, trekking, and am getting my PADI certification before I go! You’d love either place I’m sure. Pick whichever is easier logistically for you! One of my favorite food the laska and Malaysia is the best place to visit.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/scuba-diving-tioman-island/,A Scuba Diving Sensation: Tioman Island,Malaysia,"Ever since becoming certified divers in the Gili islands last year, we find ourselves concentrating our future travel plans around finding the best dive spots in that given location. After all, they say that the World is made up of 70% water, right? Arriving into Kuala Lumpur from one of the best backpacking destinations in Malaysia, we were greeted by one of the most dazzling landscapes we had laid eyes upon in all of our travels and we were excited to tick some items off our bucket list. Spending a few nights in the capital to eye the world famous Petronas Towers and snacking on the national dish, Nasi Lemak (a rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf) our thoughts soon turned to Malaysian life underwater.  It was a chance conversation with a local Malay traveller that helped us to learn about an islet that lies off the east coast of peninsular Malaysia, Tioman Island. We are always amazed at the numbers of domestic travellers who we come across during our travels and in our experience these encounters usually offer some of the finest and most rewarding travel experiences, should you act on their recommendations. So although through this article we aim to inspire you to visit Tioman Island too, really we all have our Malaysian friend Afiq to thank for this one. Thank you Afiq! You can however thank us for the following route to Tioman, as getting to the island, like most off the beaten path adventures, requires some careful planning. From Kular Lumpur, make your way to Terminal Bersepadu Selatan (TBS) bus terminal where you can board an 8 hour bus to Mersing. Being the skrimpy, savvy savers we are nowadays, we chose to save on accommodation by taking the 11pm night bus that would see us into Mersing on the east coast by 7am. A relatively comfortable sleep while making an 8 hour journey for as little as 33RM! Arriving into Mersing in the early hours, make your way to Mersing Jetty. Ask any local once disembarking the bus to point you in the right direction to the jetty, they are always willing to help! After making the 10 minute walk to the jetty be prepared to pay some environmental fees before boarding the boat to Palau Tioman. We did in fact book our boat ticket online in advance (a quick Google search will bring up a host of companies) but you can also book a ticket at the jetty. The boat will make a few stops depending on where you have chosen to stay but accommodation can also be found when stepping off at any destination on the island. The purpose of most visits to the island however is purely for the diving paradise that awaits those willing to make the 39km journey to the east coast of Malaysia. Arriving into Tioman, it is clear why the island has found itself awarded with “Worlds most beautiful island” accolades in recent times. See the incredible drone footage from our YouTube channel here The island is largely uninhabited and is densely populated with primary rainforest and greenery that remains after millions of years. The beaches are golden and sparse, in particular monkey beach, which can be accessed after a much recommended rainforest walk. Island life is so relaxed, that there is a running joke on the island that visitors must expect a “hunger games” challenge to find a restaurant serving food within normal operating times. The restaurants open when they want and serve what is available, making for an interesting culinary journey, but you can’t go wrong with picking up some local satay or roti chenai whenever and wherever you see a local setting up stall! Life’s a beach hey? The coast is dotted with diving opportunities for all abilities, languages and cater for all your diving needs from getting certified, continuing your road to becoming a dive master or fun diving at a cost of roughly 90RM per dive. Each shop complies with industry standards and whichever you opt for we assure you that the dive sites will remain etched in your diving memories for years to come. Heck, on our first outing into the mystical depths we were treated to white and black tip sharks, turtles, snaking, swimming moray eel (rare to spot during daylight hours as they usually hide) and crystal clear corals, sea fans, sponges and shipwrecks. A haven for scuba divers especially in such close proximity to Singapore. A trip to Tioman Island is a must if you are visiting Malaysia or even Singapore and if not just for the diving, visitors can explore the secluded sands, waterfalls, local village life and can be treated to some fantastic free diving and sensational snorkeling opportunities. Although the journey from KL can seem daunting at first, the majority of the journey you can sleep and you will not regret the extra effort once your feet have touched down in paradise.  About the Authors: Charlie and Charlotte are the wanderlusting couple behind The Wanderlovers. They have swapped their city life in London for an action packed journey across the globe. Hand in hand, they’re taking on one country at a time and creating a life they don’t wish to escape from! Through their couple’s travel and lifestyle blog and YouTube channel, they hope to inspire future travellers that anything is possible if you just buy that one way ticket … Go Live! Thank you for showcasing my beautiful home country. I haven’t gone back to Tioman Island and your post is making me wanting to plan to trip there soon! The water is still as pristine as I could remember. I’m glad you had a great time there! This looks like an awesome place! Never heard of it before now, which is probably half the reason it looks so great 😀 Never gone diving myself but have wanted to try it for awhile Oh my goodness! I’m currently getting ready for a big SEA trip beginning in Singapore and was debating whether I should trade up my planned Open Water on Koh Tao for the less well known Palau Tioman, and then this pops up, I feel like its a sign. My mind is made up! You can still dive in Koh Tao later! Great post! Very nice places to visit, I am planning to go in that place to relax and enjoy the nature. I will save money for it together with my family. What gorgeous photos – that blue sea reminds me of the stunning Caribbean sea in the Bahamas. Deans Blue Hole near Long Island is the second deepest blue hole in the world and an amazing place for diving. The mix of colours and the stunning surroundings make it a truly magical experience. I didn’t even know of white and black tip sharks before this post!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/climb-mount-kinabalu-in-one-day/,The Highest I’ve Ever Been: Trekking Mount Kinabalu,Malaysia,"“If you want to try it, I know of a way to do it for cheap,” he said to me from the dorm bed across the room. I had only met just met him, and we were talking about doing something fairly major together.  I hadn’t planned for it and, frankly, was ill-prepared for what awaited me.  Still, I was so intrigued, I told him that I’d like to try it. We awoke early the next morning and set out on foot, casually talking about our past travels and avoiding focusing on the monumental task ahead of us: We would be climbing Mt. Kinabalu in Borneo, Southeast Asia’s tallest mountain, in just one day. Update as of June 2017: Unfortunately, after the earthquake that rocked Kinabalu in 2015, due to safety reasons, hiking Mount Kinabalu in one day is no longer permitted. While it is stated as a temporary suspension by Sabah Parks, there is no indication as to when will hikers be able to hike it in one day again. Currently, hikers are required to do a minimum of 2D1N compulsory climb itinerary. Read on to get a glimpse of how it’s like to climb Mount Kinabalu in one day, and prep yourself for doing it over two days. I have also done the research on how you can climb Mount Kinabalu on a budget in 2 days at the bottom of this post! Most people train for this, plan ahead, and book several weeks or days prior.  I, however, hyperventilate when I have to plan things far in advance, so I didn’t do anything of the sort. I had thought climbing the mountain, at what normally costs closer to $400 for a stay in the lodge halfway up and a climb broken into two days, was simply not in the cards for me. That’s where Neil came in. He had looked into it and discovered that for closer to $65 per person, one could climb the mountain in one day and avoid staying in Laban Rata, the lodge at the 6 km mark that held a monopoly on the area, and therefore set the prices sky high for an overnight stay (and food). The catch is, to summit Mt. Kinabalu in one day, one must make it to the top by 1pm, leaving only 5 and a half hours to make it to the peak at 4,095 meters (13,440 feet).  This would seem entirely doable given it is only 8.7km (5.4 miles) to the top, however, given the elevation gain of 2229 meters (7,313 feet), and the thinning of the air as each foot is placed higher, this is no easy task. The hike was, to put it bluntly, brutal.  There were no flat parts to speak of. If it weren’t for Neil, who graciously carried my camera, water, and food, and who also kept up a very positive attitude that lifted me as well, I doubt I would have made it to the top. The beginning was only a taste of what was to come. It was mainly stone steps punctuated by the occasional steep wooden staircase.  Each half kilometer seemed like a feat of mankind and leg strength.  At about 15 minutes per half km, we were making decent time. Around the 6th kilometer, I started to worry I might not make it.  I sat down next to Neil, panting, as we took a peanut butter sandwich break.  It was a bit tougher than we both had bargained for. “I can’t get this close and not make it to the summit,” he said.  I realized that I couldn’t, either.  The final 2.7 kilometers were the toughest.  1000 meters of elevation was gained just over that short period. It started to take me 25 minutes per half kilometer.  I asked Neil to go ahead, just in case I might not make it by 1pm.  Just as I thought I might not be able to go any further, I remembered I had brought along my iPhone, and plugged in my headphones.  Why hadn’t I thought of this sooner? Music always gets me through the tough parts. Clouds of icy rain formed around me as I gripped the rope and climbed ever higher, as quickly as my legs, lactic acid screaming through them, would allow me. About .7 km from the top, I started to feel dizzy from the altitude. “Just a bit further! We can make it!” my guide smiled to me.  I glanced down at the time and realized it would barely be possible. I was going to do it.  I was going to make Mount Kinabalu my bitch. Finally I glimpsed the summit.  Neil was sitting there smiling – he had made it about 45 minutes earlier. As I climbed the final step, he held out his watch. It read 12:57pm.  We had done it. Just barely. Finally, a feeling of elation came over me.  The view was beautiful. If asked only the afternoon before, I would have had no idea I’d summit Southeast Asia’s highest mountain. The serendipity of travel never ceases to amaze. We took in the vistas for about 20 minutes before heading back down the mountain.  Unfortunately for me, what goes up must come down.  We had 8.7km of stone steps to take on and complete before 5pm. All in all, the climb was, of course, worth it.  I proved a little something to myself and realized, through sore knees and walking like an 80-year old down stairs for the next two days, that with a positive attitude and determination, almost anything is possible. Do it yourself (2D1N): Awesome! I wanted to do this while I was there, but it was raining a lot and they wouldn’t let me try it.  We did nearly the same hike (distance/elevation), though, when we climbed Jade Mountain in a day.  It was painful, and we were pretty well trained.  Good job! The more I read from other people who attempted the one-day climb, the more I realize that we massively lucked out with the weather. I didn’t realize Yushan was as tall! I need to get myself back to Taiwan. I have too much unfinished business there. Your photos are awesome! Looks like a great hike! Thank you! Beautiful view at the top. Glad you were able to get so high…  😀 You and I, we’re the climbing type 🙂 These are breathtaking photos Kristin and how big must your sense of achievement be after taking it on in a day!  Looking back always helps you to realise just how far you’ve come doesn’t it?! 🙂 Thanks, Toni. Definitely felt a sense of accomplishment and it will be a fond memory. Holy shit girl, you rock! I hike a lot out here in Colorado, but that would be TOUGH. Even hiking a 14er I think my biggest elevation gain was below 5,000 feet. Mad props!! Thank you! The second highest I’ve ever been was actually Keystone in Colorado, and it was barely below this mountain. Take it on, girl! What an epic trek! And with 3 minutes to spare! Congrats. Hats off! Really amazing story, I really want to climb a mountain one day, but the spontaneity of this climb made it legendary! Definitely added to my bucket list 🙂 Nice one, and congrats on climbing Mt. K! My wife and I are going there in mid-August, so thanks for your helpful information.  Reading your blog and seeing your amazing pics helps confirm that it can be done in one day, which is also our hope/goal/dream!  Cheers from Korea. Congrats! Good to know that they still allow one-day hikes – according to a few online sources and Lonely Planet, they might stop doing that in the future. I’ll be at Mount Kinabalu at the beginning of September and hope they’ll let me attempt the one-day hike. cheers from austria I think they like to discourage it because a lot of money is lost when people do the hike in one day.  They were supposedly limiting the number of hikers to 4 per day when I went, but that turned out to be anything but true – there were at least ten of us who attempted.  The real challenge is if the weather will permit you to get to the top. It’s much clearer in the early AM than the early afternoon. Good luck and please let me know how it goes! We ended up doing it in two days instead of one. We had already decided to stay at the Kinabalu Mountain Lodge for a couple of days, so before for the montain we walked into the Sutera Habours (the company who basically runs the Mount Kinabalu national park) office in Kota Kinabalu and asked for the price of a two-day package. The offered us the package for a little less than 1400 Ringit for two persons, which at the time were about 360 EUR or so. Since that was less than 100 EUR per person extra over what we expected to pay for a one-day hike, we went for it. After all, the extra day would mean more time to enoy the absolutely extraordinary scenery, and give us a chance to see the sun rise over Borneo from the summit. And it was worth it! Even though the summit was already very crowded when the sun came up, it’s still a breathtaking sight. We didn’t get to experience the athletic challenge that a one-day hike represents, though, but well, you can’t have everything 😉 BTW, I can highly recommend staying at the Kinabalu Montain Lodge too! Being at 1500m-1800m for a few days prior to the climb to the summit helps preventing altitude sickness, and it gives you time to explore the various trails through the national park. And DO NOT pre-book your climb over the internet. Rates for online bookings seems to be much higher than what we paid at the Sutera Habor office in Kota Kinabalu – I guess because they usually insist on selling you a second night at one of the Sutera-run accomodations inside the park. Great suggestions, Florian. Definitely book at Sutera Harbors if you do want to do the hike over two days.  I did miss out on the sunrise which is meant to be spectacular, so there are definite benefits to breaking it up into two days! Breathtaking photographs!!! Hey Massive respect for getting through that. I am thinking of doing that in a few days time – did you have any problems with getting the approval to do it in one day? I showed up the morning of and it was no problem. I can’t make any promises but it wasn’t an issue for me, nor the Irish guy I met on the summit who did the same thing. Hi Kristin, Is there a special permit that you need to apply for in advance? Also, do you have the number/s of any good guide or company that charges an affordable rate? Thanks! It’s best if you go the night before and sign up. The guides charge a flat rate as organized through the park’s official office – they’ll assign one to you. Hi great post! Question, do you think it is possible to catch a minibus back to Kota Kinabalu after descent? Thx I honestly am not sure how late they run, but you would probably be able to. If not, sharing a taxi with a few other people is always an option and not too expensive as long as there are enough of you in there. That’s insane that you managed the climb with no mental or physical training beforehand! We didn’t do much, but we did some squats and jumping jacks for a few weeks in preparation and I think it somewhat helped. Nothing could have prepared me for the shortness of breath, though! That said, the one day climb was totally worth it. More about our experience here: http://erohisms.com/trekking-mt-kinabalu-in-one-day-its-all-relative/ Maybe it helped that I hadn’t psyched myself out and didn’t really know what I was in for. Thanks to my climbing buddy for being so positive, it was infectious. I didn’t make it to the bottom until closer to 7pm, actually. You can always share a cab – that’s what I ended up doing since there were 4 of us and costs weren’t much more. Hey Kristen, Thanks for writing this up – insanely helpful. Wish I had found it earlier rather than me trying to plan it step by step. My turn Wednesday! I’m so glad you found it helpful! Let me know how it goes 🙂 Hey Kristen, Thought I would pop in. It went well, only 2 of the 9 who attempted it in the one day made it. Funny story: me and Hannes (commenter below) end up in the same minibus to the national park. Your blogs connecting people 😉 Thanks so much for coming back and telling me how it went! Yes, the day that I went only 4 of us out of 9 made it as well. It’s not easy! That’s so funny that you ended up in the same minibus! This world is small, indeed! Thanks for the amazing story. I just got back from a walk around kk tour agancies all put off by the prices and the limited slots hassle. Definetley gonna try it your way tomorrow! I’ll get back with a report in a few days if I make it. Thanks for the amazing story. I just got back from a walk around kk tour agancies all put off by the prices and the limited slots hassle. Definetley gonna try it your way tomorrow! I’ll try to get back with a report in a few days if I make it. Great! Should be able to do so without issue. Hi Kristin, I got to point out that Kinabalu is not the tallest mountain in South east Asia. there are 2 or maybe more above 5000m high in Northern Myanmar (Burma). as always, thanks Kristin for this very informative blog of yours.  my friend and i, will be trying to do the 1 day hike up mt. KK this Sept. 2014.  is the admin/park office open on weekends? we’ll be arriving on a sat. in KK and we plan to do the hike on a Sun. or Mon. the latest. I’m trying to remember, but I’m pretty sure it’s always open. Don’t quote me on that but I think I might have even done it over a weekend. have read somewhere that the granting of permit is only on weekdays though the park’s office is open on a weekend. we re-booked our plane ticket to arrive on a thursday instead of a saturday.  just making sure..hehe.. thanks..thanks.. Kristin, this post is informative and amazing! I wish so bad I’d seen it when I was in Borneo last year because I wrote off Kinabalu Mountain as soon as I saw the prices! I didn’t know you could do it on $60. It just goes to show: it always pays off to speak to people! Definitely, because I didn’t know until I had serendipitously ran into Ned. Hi  What a lovely post. I am going to do the climb in December. Do you know how I can book a stay at Labaing or other rooms ar Laban Rata without doing a tour?  Thanks in advance //Michelle Nope, that’s the one and only place to stay there and they have a monopoly, so you’re going to have to pay up, unfortunately and book some kind of package unless you do it in one day. Wow Kristin – You made it in one day!!! Congrats!! And I’m so glad you had some blue sky at the summit!! Everyone I’ve spoken to who did the one day climb only got clouds and hardly a view to speak of. I did the two day climb and the Via Ferrata  which was INCREDIBLE and, while expensive, worth every cent. And there are ways to book semi-independently rather than with a tour company as such to keep the costs a bit lower than they would have been otherwise. But then – there’s NO WAY I’d have been able to do the one day climb like you did!!  Martina 🙂 I have heard from multiple people that the two-day is worth the money. At the time I just didn’t have the funds, but seeing the sunrise there and doing a via ferrata would have been amazing. I did get very lucky with the weather! HI  Do you know if you can just turn up to the park without booking a tour through an operator? That’s what I did Wow, this looks amazing! I’ve never been to South East Asia. Most folks here (Australia) seem to do it at some point, so maybe it’s my time. Reading your posts and seeing your snaps is really inspiring me to do it. I did USA and Mexico by myself (Mexico was guided), so keen for this solo too! Thanks for the inspiration, Kristin. Enjoy Berlin! Thanks Dave and just because a bunch of other people do it too doesn’t mean you can’t still find non-touristy places. I really enjoyed my time in SEA and it’s still one of my favorite places in the world. Hey Kristin so did you do find a hostel when you arrived, stayed there for a night, climbed the mountain the next day and then go back to the hostel that night?  I’m just wondering what you did with all your bags cause I imagine you didn’t carry all that stuff while you were climbing.  If I were to do this climb in 2 days where would I put my bag? Yes I did it in one day and left my bag at the hostel. I’m sure if you do it for 2 days the company you book with or the hostel you stay in before you depart will keep your stuff for you. That’s what I always do. I even left my stuff with a hostel for 2 weeks once while I trekked in Nepal. Wow! So happy i found your blog! I’m planning to climb Mt. KK in January next year but I don’t want to spend much money doing it. I think the tour packages are too pricey for me since I’m a backpacker type of mountaineer, and I don’t really that much fund. Thanks for sharing your experience. I will try this when I visit KK next year! I felt the same way. Good luck on your climb! Hi Odil!  Did you make it to kinabalu? Looking to go next month and we need updated info. Online, it seems like theyve stopped giving one day permits or thats just what they want people to know… but according to one Sabahan, they still release them. So confused here. Any updates appreciated!! 🙂 Hi Annemari! Did you make it to Kinabalu? We are also wondering if they give one day permits now, after the earthquake last June. Any updates would be awesome! =) hi kristin,i nearly died climbing mt kk over 2 days.  you’re freaking fit! how do you do that while you travel all over the world? is there a daily regimen that you follow, hence allowing you to go conquer S.E. mountain on a whim?  kudos to you! I nearly died too! I think the reason why I did it is because I actually went into it with no idea how hard it was going to be. At each point, I didn’t realize it was about to get tougher. I’m also ridiculously stubborn and competitive and I couldn’t stomach the thought of not finishing in a day.  But I do trek a lot. It’s my main source of fitness so my legs are primed for it and that helps. Kristin,Having done it in 2d1n back in 2012 – I know how tough it must have been for u to do it within a day!Some comments – one guide can now hold up to 6 hikers, this was the information provided to my group and I when we hiked in 2012, while Mt Kinabalu is not the highest peak in SEA (some peaks in Myanmar tower above it – they are above 5000m and are part of the Himalaya range) 🙂 But most people accept Kinabalu as the highest peak in SEA due to its easy accessibilityNew track to the peak is being opened in Dec – am gonna attempt it in April 2016 🙂 Feel free to join!  Cheers,Vignes I hiked in 2013 so my guess is the rules changed to one guide, 2 hikers from 6 but everyone should double check!Cool about the new track! Ugh I don’t know if I ever really want to do Kinabalu again but never say never! Great mountaineering adventure! It is very helpful that you provide at the end of your blog the things that might done in Mount Kinabalu. The views are very amazing, it feels like you are in the top of the world that the clouds are very reachable. Indeed a breath-stopping view. Ive climbed this mountain exactly 4 weeks before the earthquake. From experience, i can tell hands down that this is one of the hardest climb especially for amateur like me. So I just want to say how amazing it is to know you can conquer it within one day.  That being said, I just want to know what time did you started climbing and what time did you managed to get to the top?  and also which entry did you take and which route did you take to end your climb? Timpohon or Mesilau I didn’t know there was more than one entry. At the time I think there was just one. It took me 12 hours from 7 to 7 Nice one!  It is about time I had an adventure in Sabah and you’ve got me thinking about this one Hey Kristin looks like a great adventure! I’ve been wanting to do this trip for a few years now. Did you guys have to book anything in advance or you just show up and get a permit the night before? I had heard that guides were booked out months in advance… which prevented me from trying last time I went to Kota Kinabalu. I just showed up because booking in advance was a lot more expensive. I believe things may have changed regulation-wise after the earthquake, though. This was about 3 years ago that I did it. My wife and I did the walk at the beginning of August 2016. We did book months ahead of time as from what I am told post earthquake they only allow 100 walkers per day (used to be 200) and no more same day walkers anymore, it books out months ahead of time we were told, not sure if true or not. When we did arrive on the day there were signs up also saying no 1 day trips for sale. We booked directly via Sutera in January and for whatever reason they sold us a 1 night package which of course was cheaper than the 2 day one where the first night is at the park entrance. We just stayed at far cheaper accommodation close to the park entrance. All up including guide and entrance fees and the stay at Laban Rata, the shuttle to the start of the track etc, we paid about $290 USD each. Sadly for us a storm came in once we reached Laban Rata and lasted all night, and coupled with a very minor earthquake it prevented anyone from summiting, so we never made it to the top, but the walk to that point had been amazing as we had trained so were fit enough for it not to bother us. All the same our legs were sore for a few days after descending. Hope this gives people an idea about the current situation that we experienced. Thank you for updating us! I’d heard that there were no more 1-day permits post-earthquake (but I don’t really understand why that would matter or change anything, unless the trail became more precarious). Hi, your trek seemed awesome and beautiful. I would like to do the same this year. Can you give me any contact to do the trek (guide…) ? And I have no idea regarding the price for 12 days of trek, can you help me on that ?many thanks for your help It only takes 2 days max to hike up there. I have no idea about 12. I did this all in person at the base of the mountain. Hey Kristin, Awesome blog you have here! Love your ‘no worries, just see what happens’ approach. Gave me quite a few ideas for my future travels. For people who would like to climb the mountain in 1 day, give my approach a try. I did the climb in March 2015 (this was a few months before the earthquake). During that time a 1 day climb was already not allowed anymore.. well so the staff said at the reception desk of the national park. Reason for this was that too many people who try it in 1 day couldn’t make it and this created dangerous situations in a few cases.  Stubborn as we were we insisted that we could speak to the manager. A phone call was made and half an hour later we were sitting at the managers desk. We convinced him that we were fit enough to do the 1 day climb and he told us that it is still possible but you had to buy a 5 day climbing permit (normally used by teams who are practicing for more extreme mountaineering adventures). This permit was more expensive but still cheaper than an overnight stay on the mountain. Total costs for park entrance, permit and guide was around 180 dollar per person. Thanks for the update! Well done for doing it in 1 day! Very nice guide, just a question, doing it yourself you mention park entrance fee, a guide and transport and sleeping at Laban Rata. Is your room at Laban Rata automatically booked and included with park entrance fee for $55 or where do you book this and what does it cost? thank you You often book all together and you can see about doing so in Kota Kinabalu. Hi,After reading that sound like a great hike! Thanks for sharing! And is it possible to hike it in one day still exactly how you did? Or if I read correctly you did this before they changed the rules? Thanks so much! I did it before they changed the rules so now I think it must be two days unfortunately. Hello there, Love your review. I plan to go to kinibalu in 2D/1N. Are forced to take accommodation to Laban Rata ? Can I just camp ? Even if I have a guide with me haha. Because actually if we are 3 the price is around 1500 rm to go to the top of kinabulu, but I am looking for a cheaper price… Thanks guys,  Adrien I believe it’s a must unfortunately. Your blog brought back some memories. In 1993, while studying at a university in Penang, my friend and I went to Sabah to visit a uni mate during the holidays. The friend in Sabah had asked us prior to our trip if we wanted to climb Mt K and we said ‘okay”. None of us had done any training whatsoever for climbing the mountain. The morning of the climb, as we gathered at the foot of the hill, I got my period! In those days, I used to get terrible stomach cramps on the first day of my period, which would usually see me lying in bed with my feet up, after taking a piriton. The trip and guide had already been paid for, so I didn’t want to pull out. Within 5 minutes of starting the climb, my friends and I were huffing and puffing. We found the hike to Laban Rata really tough. Halfway there, I started getting stomach cramps. I stopped and took a painkiller, and then soldiered on in agony while waiting for the medicine to take effect. We reached Laban Rata around 3pm, probably one of the last group of people to get there that day. We weren’t prepared for the bitter cold, and only had some very light windbreakers with us. Needless to say, we didn’t sleep well. Early the next morning, 10 mins into our ascent to the peak, my two mates called it quits and said they were heading back. I didn’t entertain the thought and remembered my high school’s motto ‘ accomplish or do not begin’. Of course, this part of the hike was much more difficult because of the thin air and bitter cold. I stopped every minute to catch my breath until my guide grabbed my hand and pretty much pulled me to the top. He probably had decided that otherwise, we wouldn’t be reaching the peak in time for sunrise. I remember the descent was very hard on the knees and I had a fever by the time we finished. My husband is very keen to climb Mt K one day, but I told him, I have absolutely no intention of doing it again. Having said that, we did go up Goldopiggen, Norway’s highest mountain, last year. Although not as steep as Mt K, I did find it tough mentally and physically, although I had done a bit of training for it. Wow good for you for pushing through! Like you, I’m pretty sure  I don’t need to do that hike again either! Your from SoCal and didn’t do Mt. Whitney?   Then Mt. K would have been your second highest hike.  Whitney, by the way, was an awesome hike with snow in July when I made the summit.   Nice blog, thanks. I haven’t done it yet! I’ve hiked higher since then but it was in Nepal 😉    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/malaysias-hidden-waterfall-chemerung-falls/,"Malaysia’s Hidden Waterfall, Chemerung Falls",Malaysia,"Arriving into the capital of Malaysia we were greeted by a vibrant, diverse and dazzling cityskape that lived up to our expectations of those instaworthy shots that we have all seen of Malaysia’s most beloved landmarks such as the Petronas Towers, pasted across every hand held device known to man. After exploring the wonders of Kuala Lumpur, like any short city stay we were ready to delve into some new landscapes and in particular the luminous green flora that Malaysia is known for throughout the World. Opting to take our exploration to the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia, we were excited to rise bright and early for a day of galavanting. If the East Coast was anything like our trip to the West, where we found the Maldives of Malaysia and got some seriously epic drone footage to match, we were in for a real treat. Arriving at our accommodation, we informed our host of our intention to see the real Malaysia and to our delight the likable local beamed, seemingly at the location that must have popped immediately into her head as we asked the question. With a wide smile she proclaimed, ‘Chemerung Falls’. This was in fact music to our ears as we are regular fall goers (if anyone hasn’t already checked our YouTube vlogs where you can find such adventures) and often find ourselves searching and bathing in the majesty of such phenomenon. It was almost instantly decided. Our day was set and jungle trekking in Terengganu to the local landmark waterfall was to be our destination. That fond familiar feeling rushing through every fibre that flows through our veins every time we are heading into the unknown, accomplished. Indeed this was a location every inch unbeknownst to us. We were lucky enough to have a car arranged for us from our amazing, unmistakably Malay resort accommodation, to the exact location where you can begin your trek to the waterfall, but ask anyone in the Terrangan area and they will gladly point you in the right direction. For those looking for a more independent exploration and adventure, you do not have to look far for cars and scooters to rent for about 100MYR per day. Driving through local villages where locals trade goods and palm fields filled with lush green trees roll across the hillsides, the journey itself is a sight to behold. Indeed, it is an exciting thought of sighting a wild elephant that approaches on occasion, as announced by the brightly coloured elephant crossing signs dotting the main roads. As our vehicle climbed a steep hill, the first sight of the waterfall came into view on the horizon. A slither of crystal white water slicing the adjacent shades of greenery. We were informed by our driver that the waterfall is in fact over 300m high and if you were to trek to the top of the falls for a birds eye view of the formation and what must be a visually stunning panoramic view of the Al-Muktafibilah province, one must tackle the 9 hour climb to the top. If only we had brought our camping gear and made a night of it! Alas, time waits for no man and we were more than happy to venture the mere 2 hour trek through the jungle to reach the base of the falls. Arriving at Chemerung Amenity Forest, the starting point of our trek through the jungle, we geared up and threw our packs on our backs. Trekking through the array of bright green jungle landscape, we waded through the wilderness as we crossed streams, scaled rocks and ducked overhangs of the dense forest. Well and truly away from the beaten path and deep into jungle territory, we admired bewildering shaped trees, eyed (not tried) mushrooms of all sizes and attempted to glance the rare sight of wild boar that are known to roam the forest. The trail starts out with a clear path that fades dramatically the further you venture, though do keep a close eye to the ground as well as the landscape to guide your way. If you feel you have veered to far from the route, then stick to the trail bending around the river and you will definitely find your way. After almost an hour and a half of roving, the soundscape of crashing water protrudes from the treetops. Cruising around the corner, what lay before us was a sight of might. Standing well over 300 metres tall with foaming waters cascading from the skies above, slipping down the craggy mountainside and pooling in the basins of rock below, we were simply dwarfed as we stood in awe of this natural wonder. There are times during our travels where we realise what a small space we occupy in the World and our time here was one of those moments and a moment to savour for sure. Taking our time to enjoy the waterfall, we made for the array of flows that plummeted from the rock face and let the twinkling mists soak our skin. Sensibly opting to wear black in 40 degree heat (well done Charlie) it was a welcoming sensation to cool off in the basin below and swim in the fresh mountain waters, so fresh in fact that you can drink from it. Satisfying our never ending craving to ‘go live in the moment’ we couldn’t help but quench our thirst. The most refreshing end to our search for Chemurung falls hidden in the depths of the Malaysian jungle.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/kek-lok-si/,Seeing the Beauty of Kek Lok Si,Malaysia,"Day 215 Upon my departure from Thailand after a combined three glorious months, the familiar mixture of unease and excitement that accompanies landing in a new country came over me.  I knew almost nothing about Malaysia, and wasn’t sure what to expect, especially after becoming so comfortable in Thailand. So comfortable, in fact, that I am still converting Malaysian Ringgit to Thai Baht in my head rather than directly to US Dollars.  Imagine my excitement to find that, just like my first unfamiliar days in Bangkok, I’d have someone to guide me through – James Clark.  I absolutely love it when I arrive in a town and find out that James happens to be around.  This means several things: he will know where all the best food is, will be able to suggest a great coffee shop, will know where to find the best WiFi, and will already have local transportation figured out. In short, I can be extremely lazy about doing research or planning of any kind, which is my favorite. I asked him what the best thing to do in Penang was (other than stuffing my face with amazing food at every possible interval), and he suggested Kek Lok Si – the largest Buddhist temple in the whole of Southeast Asia.  Given that I don’t seem to suffer the common traveler ailment of being “templed out”, even after the amazingness of Angkor Wat, Sukhothai, and the White Temple, I was excited to see what Kek Lok Si had on offer. I was not disappointed: *Photos are in order of how one would see these sights walking through the temple James and I elected to pick out some prayer ribbons. He selected “continuous run of wealth luck,” and I went with “success in all things.”  Doesn’t seem like too much to ask, right? Under construction since 1890, this temple is still growing.  With main construction completed in 1905, the main pagoda that gives the temple its notoriety was completed in 1930. The pagoda incorporates Chinese, Thai, and Burmese elements of design, giving it a unique look. The next level up, accessible by lift, features the 100-foot tall statue of Kuan Yin – Goddess of mercy.  This is where the new construction can be seen. Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to see her up-close, as the new construction prohibited tourists from climbing up the stairs to the statue.  This resulted in me disliking all of my photos of her, but Wikipedia does a nice job. Do it Yourself:  Great to cross paths with you again, Kristin! I’m always happy to show friends around cities I know and love, so that was a fun day out for me. Meanwhile I’m still waiting for my “continuous run of wealth luck” to kick in….any moment now 🙂 Yeah my “success in all things” is chugging away, but I was expecting instant fame, wealth, and groupies.  I’d settle for just the groupies, I suppose… Damn, I want to change my ribbon now 🙂 I’m a big fan of this temple. Probably my favorite thing I saw on Penang. I wish I’d gotten pictures as amazing as yours. Great job! Thanks so much, Jim! Hi! I came across your blog through your post on Angkor Wat.I’m a Malaysian btw…You’ll love the food in Penang.Visit Kuala Lumpur or Malacca (the historical state). If you love beaches then you should check out Perhentian Island in TerrengganuHope you will have a great time exploring Malaysia 🙂 I did love the food in Penang! I had the best chicken curry samosa of my life in Little India there. All of those are on my list to visit. Posts to come soon!  So far, I absolutely love Malaysia. Temple architecture has got to be one of my favorite things. Same. I can never get tired of marveling at what love can create. Absolutely gorgeous photos! What stunning colors. I hope when I visit SE Asia, I never get “templed out” 🙂 Hasn’t happened to me yet and I’m working hard at it! Wow, I must admit this temple is so mystical and spiritual. Great shots. Wish I could explore it on my own. I guess I will never get bored of Buddha statues… 🙂 I really don’t think I’ll ever get tired of Buddha statues! Beautiful photos! I clicked on this because I had no idea where Kek Lok Si was, and I am traveling through SE Asia.  I was in Penang four years ago, and I “think” we went to this temple, but your photos are amazing and so vivid, it makes me question whether we saw the same one.  Perhaps I was on too much of an eating high, or perhaps I had the meat sweats from too many pork dumplings!  Thanks for sharing. Haha, it was a very bright place! Love your photos! Kek Lok Si is one of my favorite temples in Southeast Asia. 🙂 Thanks! It was quite stunning. Nice photos – Kek Lok Si was also one of my favourite temples with so much to explore and so many beautiful colours Thank you! It was so impressive. I almost forgot until I looked at my photos again. It was also so varied with all kinds of different styles and influences, much like Malaysia itself!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/get-sim-cards-southeast-asia/,How to Get SIM Cards in Southeast Asia,Malaysia,"In a comment on a recent post, I was asked to write about traveling with an unlocked iPhone (or any smart phone, really), obtaining SIM cards abroad, and how the whole process takes place. Kellie, I’m glad you asked. I have been traveling for over 5 years now with an unlocked iPhone, always buying a prepaid SIM in the local country I happen to be traveling in. Why buy a local Sim? I have found in Southeast Asia that this is particularly helpful because the Wifi is often weak, but the 3G is usually quite strong.  It’s also great to be able to make calls when needed and to always be able to use the google maps function.  It gives me peace of mind. Why buy an unlocked phone? I had originally obtained my phone with a contract with AT&T back in the United States.  As anyone who has tried to unlock a phone knows, one can only do this by calling the provider after the 2-year contract is up.  We won’t even address traveling with a SIM from back home, because that is prohibitively expensive.  If your contract is not yet up then your options are somewhat limited.  You can, A: Call your provider and ask them to put you on a disabled plan. This was allowed with AT&T for 6 months at $10 month, which finished out my contract.  It’s not ideal, but it’s better than the $75/month I was previously paying.  The phone will still be locked, but you can use it with wifi only, which is still useful.  You can then buy a cheap local phone with a local SIM B: Put your phone on a disabled plan and use a shady 3rd party website to unlock it. Honestly, I went with this plan, though I won’t link the website I used here (but you can contact me if you really want the details) and I probably should not have just admitted that, as it goes against the contract and one can be fined for doing so SIM card availability for smart phones Generally, I find that many countries in Southeast Asia are now catching up and the iPhones are more and more available, meaning micro and nano SIM cards are as well.  That said, there have been plenty of times when the person at the stall handed me a standard SIM along with a pair of scissors as well.  Sometimes they have a SIM cutter and sometimes they don’t. In the cases that they don’t I just remove my current SIM, match up the edges, and cut.  It does’t have to be perfect, it just has to generally fit (and make sure you’re only cutting the plastic part). How to find a SIM card There are a few ways to find a SIM and it depends on the country. In Thailand, they can be easily purchased at 7-11. I personally use DTAC, and I buy it directly at the DTAC store. They tend to have locations in big cities such as Phuket, Chiang Mai, and Bangkok. 4G is widely available, and data plan runs at about 100 baht for 1GB worth of data valid for a week. One must also buy the SIM itself for around 50 baht, if memory serves.  There were no language barrier issues. in Cambodia, Metfone is the most popular network, and you can find the flagship stores in major cities. 1.5GB worth of data valid for a week costs just $1.5. There are no 7-11s in Cambodia, but SIMs can be bought at smaller cell stands as well.  There were no language barrier issues in Siem Reap. In Laos, it was a little less straightforward.  I paid around $10 for a SIM and found that the data ran out fairly quickly. I never found a cell store there and just bought from a nondescript stand. I wish I could be more helpful here, but I was pretty disconnected in Laos and didn’t worry too much about it. In Malaysia, it is not as cheap to stay connected. There are a few good companies and you really can’t go wrong. Most malls there sell the SIMs which include data and some calling and texts.  Since most Malaysians speak English quite well you shouldn’t have much issue getting a SIM. With the country’s largest network, Maxis, 1GB worth of data valid for a week costs about $2.5. Indonesia still baffles me a bit.  In Medan, I bought a SIM with the 3 network for only $3, and the 3G never ran out over the 6 weeks that I lived there.  I still don’t understand why because the man I bought it from spoke no English and at the time I spoke almost zero Bahasa.  However, it only worked in major cities.  Simpati was the best bet for the islands, such as Lombok and Bali, but I had to reload it constantly. I found that small amounts ran out very quickly, but as soon as I put USD$10 on there, it lasted for a while. There’s also usually a service fee to reload, so might as well do it infrequently.  This can all be handled at cell phone stands and convenience stores. With all of the SIM purchasing scenarios, make sure the 3G is fully functioning before walking out of the store or away from the stand. It’s often not as straightforward as just popping in the SIM and you may need some additional help setting up the network. There you have it.  The ins and outs of buying a SIM are actually pretty straightforward, but just take a little bit of know how in some countries prior to purchasing.  If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask in the comments section. This was super helpful! I never have a phone when I travel (I just use mine for WiFi) and I really don’t know why. It’s so cheap and so convenient in tons of places. It IS nice to feel disconnected…but Google Maps is also great. Always a trade-off! I do enjoy being off the grid from time to time too! For Malaysia I used Tune Talk, the SIM card which I purchased along with my Air Asia ticket (although you can purchase it upon arrival) and picked up at the airport. The staff where very helpful and set up my phone so I didn’t have to do anything! It cost me about $30 per month if I remember correctly 🙂 For Indonesia I can’t remember exactly what SIM I used (I’m thinking something called eXcel), but I remember I paid for it and then the lady at the shop couldn’t get it to work on my phone (HTC smartphone). I went back to my room and Googled it, and sure enough – there were instructions on how to change the settings to make it work. I think I put about $20 on for the month I was there. It worked on the Gillis and on Lombok.  For any Australian readers – it SHOULD be free to get your phone unlocked. Just contact your service provider, put your plan on hold (they usually do this for free for up to 3 months, though any insurance you pay on top of it, you still need to pay). For Vodafone, you should be able to unlock your phone online. IMPORTANT – make sure you do this before you leave Australia as you need to input some codes into your phone. Thanks for the additional info! I had no idea about Tune Talk or that Aussie phones can be unlocked while under contract. Awesome! Thank you so much, Kristin! This is just what I needed. Like you said, it’s a painful outlay at first so I’ve been holding off. The camera is important to me so I’m probably going to get the new 5S but I’m still figuring out which country to buy from. I feel like I’m slowly getting closer though and I’ll be coming back to this very useful post to put your tips into practice. You’re a star. Glad to help! For Travelers to Viet Nam,It is easy to buy a cheap cellphone such as Nokia, SamSung,LG,… with the price only 20- 30 USD. You can find the Phone Shop easily a long streets in the towns with signs of Nokia, IPhone, Samsung,…The micro Sim card for iphone also is sale very popular in these shops and they even can cut your normal Sim card to make it fix to your Iphone (the fee could be 1 USD or if you buy the cellphone from them they will do it for free).If you want to have more information, i am always ready to help.Thao Phan Thanks for the info! I haven’t yet been to Vietnam so that was definitely missing from this post! Hello, I will go to 4000 islands (Don Det) in South Laos, can I use my DTAC Thai SIM card there ? It’s close to the border. Nope 🙁 once you cross borders they stop working I’m back. Right, it’s not working. Bought a Laos SIM card for 2$. Hi Kristin, Just found your site while looking up suggestions for Simcards in Cambodia. We’ve been using our unlocked iphone4s and had the exact same scenario as you mentioned come up while in Bali; the amount of money coming off our cheap sim there didn’t seem to make sense! I’m glad I came across your site now as we are heading over to Vietnam in a week and I see you were just there! Awesome! Hope my suggestions help :). SIMs there are super cheap! They certainly did! I liked it so much, I even had to write a quick post about it Thank you. I finally got an iPhone 5s with an unlocked sim card. In Japan I never found one, but it is good to hear I could get one in other Asian countries. I do agree it is sort of fun to be off the grid, I used my iPad and email a lot when i travel. In the Philippines, it is also very easy and cheap to buy sim cards! I think around 50 Pesos, and you can top up your load. Texting is most common there and calling is more expensive. I don’t know about 3G, I did not really need it because many places have WiFi. I wanted it more for 3G and found one company very expensive and one was just fine. I think the cheaper one was World something. Multiple misinformations to me from Smart Internet and their agents resulted in pretty much my entire day wasted and still no decent internet connection. The worst of it was that much of their misinformation to me seemed to me to be quite deliberate and extremely blameworthy. Hi Kristin – Thanks for the helpful info, here and all over your site! I’m planning a year long trip to Australia (6-8 months), SE Asia (about 2 months) and Europe (2-4 months). I plan on disabling my Verizon account and using a site to unlock my iphone 5. Do you have a suggestion for getting a SIM card in Australia? Do you think this system will also work in Europe? Thank you 🙂 I always get SIMs everywhere I go, even now in Eastern Africa! I can’t recall who I used in Australia, honestly. Just ask the locals for the best company when you arrive, which is what I usually do. I have Samsung Note 3, a 4G LTE smartphone.VZW confirmed that all its 4G LTE smartphones are unlocked.  We confirmed that with different phones 2 Note 3 and 1 iPhone 5, with micro SIM purchased over many countries: Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Vietnam, and Italy.  With the exception in Vietnam where we used a local network, we used Vodafone micro SIM’s in all remaining countries.  We’re traveling to Thailand,  Indonesia,  Singapore, and Malaysia in August 2015, and we’re confident we’ll have no troubles using local micro SIM’s. Thank you for the details of different networks available in these countries, as well as their cost. There’s always a pair of scissors around to make a SIM fit as well. Hey Kristin, I’m wondering if you ever considered using T Mobile since they seem to have a pretty good deal with international travel.  Unlimited data and texting, .20 a minute to talk.  They are charging $60 a month for that, but does it make more sense to use local SIM cards?  Is there better service using local SIM cards? I have definitely considered it, but it’s almost universally more expensive than the SIM cards in the countries I’m traveling to. For example I paid $4 in Vietnam per Gigabyte of data. Greetings from Fiji. I am anindigenous. Hope you cover the south pacific…. There are thousands of islands to cover ? Whose beaches, Reefs and rainforest  will stop your heart.  And take your breath away.. Come try!!!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/plaza-premium-lounge-klia/,How to Spend a Layover at KLIA2: The Plaza Premium Lounge,Malaysia,"You guys I feel like I’ve stumbled upon the holy travel grail. I’m buzzing so much with excitement right now that I don’t even care about the nine hours left of my 12-hour layover. In fact I’m kind of sad to see the time ticking down (never thought I’d say that). Now normally I’d do everything possible to avoid such a long layover, but I originally thought I’d use the time to explore Kuala Lumpur, since it’s a city that I really do like a lot, but I just have way too much work to do after playing all last week on Gili Air, so I’ve ended up here at the airport for a pretty long stretch of time. Enter: The best decision I have ever made at an airport.  Pay-in lounges at airports – as in the ones that you can pay a fee to enter without having a business or first class ticket – usually require a search akin to a treasure hunt to find. The one at KLIA2 is no different. I searched for information about such a lounge online last night and found some info on this one, which I expected to have a big, bright sign. Not so, friends. It’s actually hidden within a spa! I walked up to two unsmiling desk attendants after asking around and being pointed to a spa entrance. They looked at me like something the cat had just dragged in and maybe given my 3am wakeup in Bali to make my first flight, I indeed looked the part. Confused, I asked if I was in the right place and was told that yes, I was, but I had to pay for one of three premium spa treatments for a 10-hour entry. “The 90-minute massage for 330 Rinngit perfect for you,” one of them suggested. Oh really? I’m sure.  I selected a 60-minute sugar scrub, since it was the cheapest that would grant me lounge access, and settled in for my have-to massage. It cost me 197 MYR, which is the equivalent of $48 USD. At first it felt like someone was rubbing sand into my skin but eventually I melted like butter into the massage table and fell in love with the treatment. It was like someone scratching my back and legs and since my spirit animal is a cat I adored it. I’d paid for 60 minutes but she gave me 90. I wanted to hug and kiss her. Following, I got the hot shower I’d been hoping for, with a free toothbrush, and then checked out the food situation.  You guys, it’s all you can eat breakfast, with eggs, beans, sausage, and coffee. There’s even infused water. Holy mother of God! Orange and cucumber-infused water! But that’s not all!  (I sound like an infomercial, don’t I?) They switch out the food regularly throughout the day so that you can try different things. Oh and did I mention the all-you-want coffee, beer, and soft drinks? WITH chilled glasses? That’s the cherry on top.  It’s also super quiet in here, with faster, dedicated Wi-Fi and since nobody seems to know about this place, except for one other lady who exclaimed to me, “well this was a find wasn’t it!?” it’s super fast. There are plugs and swivel chairs everywhere which is convenient. I also don’t have to constantly hear that annoying loud speaker announcing flights, though there is a screen in here so that I can make sure I get out of here on time for mine. So I’ve paid $48 bucks for a massage, all the food I want, fast Wi-Fi, and all the coffee I want, too. This is a way better value than I could ever find by just going to food joints within the airport over the course of 12 hours.  If you want to find it, head up to the second floor of KLIA2 right after security, but before the second security that takes you to the gates. Find the McDonalds and right next to it you’ll see the spa. Ask inside if it’s the Plaza Premium Lounge just to be sure. You’re welcome. P.S. I paid my way in here. Nobody asked me to write this. I’m just that stoked on it. This looks amazing! Had a long layover in Changi recently and considered a lounge but you don’t really need one there. KLIA is a totally different story and I will have to keep this in mind for next time I fly through.  Thanks for sharing 🙂 This looks awesome! I wish I had known about it. Another things most travelers don’t know is that there is a capsule hotel with showers in the KLIA2 terminal (it’s called Container by Capsule Hotel). You get your own private little capsule with a mattress, privacy screen, lights, and outlet and access to hostel-style showers for about $18 USD for a short stay (or at least that was how much it cost when I went last summer). Totally worth it, and great if you’re connecting via Kuala Lumpur for cheap Air Asia flights. Another little tip: You get free access to hundreds of different lounges with the Citi ThankYou Prestige card. It has a high annual fee which is offset by a travel reimbursement, but it still ends up costing about $200 a year out of pocket per year after the first year. I had a Citi account which effectively makes my annual fee $100 a year, which is worth it considering I get to use lounges about 10+ times per year!! Thanks for that tip because my next move was going to be to look up cards that give me lounge access. Definitely worth the $ because I’m in airports constantly and need variety since I’m always flying different airlines and sometimes out of really obscure airports. Dude from now on I’m searching this out every time I have a long layover! It was such a good value Such a great find! Things in airports are always so hidden, you would have no idea they were there unless you knew beforehand. A good reminder to always look it up! That lounge looks fantastic! I will be travelling next week and have a 12 hour layover at KLIA. I will definitely look for this lounge! Thanks for writing about this! We’re ALWAYS travelling via KL and spend a lot of time in KLIA2 – but haven’t come across this! We’ve stayed in the Sama Sama before, but I’m thinking perhaps this is new as we always eat at the McDonald’s. Will be taking advantage next time! 🙂 Thanks Kristin! It’s really close to Sama Sama! Might have to take advantage of this … thanks for the tip! Awesome! Thanks for sharing. I was looking for such an option for my travel next week with a 9 hr layover. This option ($48 bucks for a massage, all the food we want, fast Wi-Fi, and all the coffee we want 🙂 ) is not visible when we try to book online at Plaza Premium website. Could you find me the exact link for what you booked as its very confusing with several names and packages and stuff. What you mentioned (Spa, food and a place to rest) is what I am looking for thru a 8-9 hr period next week. Thanks a lot and keep writing I didn’t book ahead I went there in person. This looks great! However don’t they normally kick you out after 3 hours? You can buy 2/3 hours entrance but I’m not sure how strict they are about this… they sure weren’t in your case, you’re very lucky! 🙂 The massage I bought gave me 9 hours.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sipadan-diving-review/,A Visual Tour of Diving in Sipadan: The World’s Best Diving,Malaysia,"I have been a diving fiend ever since I made it to Southeast Asia. Always on the hunt for the best diving around, I’ve hit up Cambodia, Thailand, and Perhentian Island in Peninsular Malaysia, looking for the best dive spot in the world. All of them had something different to offer and were worth the time and money spent in their own unique ways, but nothing can ever compare to the amazingness that was SCUBA diving in Sipidan in Malaysian Borneo. I could sit here and wax poetic about it for ages, but why do that when I can simply show you exactly what I saw? Most divers who dive Sipadan stay on Mabul, where the , a sea gypsy tribe, make their home: Sipadan Island itself is uninhabited, and absolutely stunning: Here’s a look at the sea creatures at the dive sites around Mabul and at Sipadan: Finally, the crown jewel of my Sipadan experience – my favorite video clips strung together, featuring all of the animals you saw above and more (turn on the sound! The animals swim to the music):  Diving Sipadan was a dream come true. I still get goosebumps when I think about it. Do it yourself: Read more of my reviews of diving in Southeast Asia: Cambodia, Similan Islands, and Perhentian Island *Thank you so much to my dive buddy, Kristy, for sharing her photos and video footage with me. Our combined efforts made this post possible.  Looks like you had an amazing dive! Southeast Asia has definitely been our favorite region to dive in thus far. There is so much diversity it’s mind-blowing. It seems like every little crack is hiding something new. Those nudibranchs are pretty wild! The best dives we have had so far were at Apo Island in the Philippines. Thanks for sharing! The Philippines is the next diving site for me after Indonesia! I’ve heard so many good things. You got some crazy amazing photos in this one! The kids on the boat is fantastic! I’m not a swimmer, or a diver, but I can see why so many people want to do it because some of those guys are incredible. Especially the angry-assed sea monster. Holy awesomesauce! The photos and footage are unreal. Seriously impressive- I have so much trouble getting good shots while diving. So far, the Great Barrier Reef is still my top dive experience, but Sipadan looks equally amazing. I def want to do GBR. There are just too many places that I need to dive, and not enough time (or money) Hi,Amazing pics! Looks fabulous? Have you been to Maldives? For me it’s still the number one destination to dive, and you should really enjoy it now, as the whole place is endangered!Also an amazing dive: Navy Pier in Exmouth, Western Australia: the best security stop ever! I’m dying to go but it’s a little costly! My ever-growing list of dive destinations is getting absolutely ridiculous. Hey Kristin,  Sipadan looks great, I’ve been wanting to check it out. I’m doing a one month dive trip to the Philippines and Indonesia in September, will hit up Malapascua Island, Raja Ampat and Komodo. Can’t wait! 🙂 I have heard great things about all of those. I’ve only done Komodo and it was fantastic (just posted a video with a manta ray – epic). Let me know how the others are! Amazing!  How much did it cost?  I’ve been scuba diving only once, several years ago.  I am not certified or have any equipment but I really want to do this! It was not cheap.  Not cheap at all! I think I spent $500 for 3 nights on Mabul and 10 dives. This and Komodo were the most costly for diving.  Other places like Perhentian were super cheap.  Unfortunately, though, I find the more expensive the diving, the better it tends to be. You get what you pay for. Hi!So glad I came across your blog. Read some of your posts and they are all very interesting and helpful.I especially loved your Mt. Kinabalu post!!! Incredible!I have definitely bookmarked your blog for future searches for asia. I am currently researching for a trip to Malaysia. We are a couple of divers and would like to dive in Sidapan. We would have about 17 days of travel in December.I was thinking Kuala Lumpur (3days), Singapore (5 days) , and Semporna (want to stay with scuba junkies).I was also intersted in either Kota Kinabalu or Langkawi.Both places look very nice and I am having trouble picking one. Have you been to either of those places? Where would you recommend?Thanks in advance. Jenifer. I really liked Scuba Junkie but I’d suggest staying on Mabul instead of Semporna. You’ll be glad you did. Make sure you book ahead! Both Langkawi and KK are cool. I also found Perhentian to be gorgeous but it’s a bit out of your way. Hi Kristin,I just got back from my Mabul trip with SJ – thanks to your post! The diving was really great (eventhough I didn’t get to dive Sipadan as it was fully booked). Definitely will come back in a heartbeat. Hope to read more diving posts from your site.Happy bubbling 🙂 /R Thanks so much for letting me know that you enjoyed it! Mabul is still really good diving.  I’m going on a dive trip in a couple days in the Philippines so I’ll be posting about that soon 🙂 That does look awesome! Was there much for bigger life in that area? Dont get me wrong, I love the macro stuff, but was there any big sharks, mantas, whales, or anything? Did you explore the jungles of Borneo at all while you were there? Hi Jon, Sipadan is all about the big stuff – big schools of jack fish, barracuda, bump head parrotfish, and sometimes hammerhead sharks.  At the very least, TONS of sea turtles and white and black tipped reef sharks. It was the best diving I’ve done, but only by a very small margin compared to Belize and Komodo.  Sadly the jungles of Sabah, at least, are now mostly replaced by palm oil plantations. I took a motorbike all over that part and that’s what I saw 🙁 Wow! what an extreme water adventure. I wanna try that one too. Hi, I’m travelling to SE Asia in the new year and I am so glad that I have found your blog it has been so helpful!! I was just wondering how did you go about booking your diving in Sipadan and who through? I can’t seem to find any reliable looking websites when googling. Also do you need certain levels of diving experience to be able to dive there? Thanks in advance, Sam. Hi Sam, Yes at least advanced open water. I did SCUBA Junkies and they were great! We also dove Borneo for our honeymoon (in 2010). It was gorgeous and I loved the volume of fish at Sipidan, but I was a bit put off how all the dive boats went to all the dive sites at the same time. At just 120 (140?) divers a day, you’d think they could all spread out! It was more spread out when I went, actually. Maybe by 2013 they had figured it out a bit better? I’d be annoyed by that too. Thank you so much for your helpful post and amazing pictures. I’m also going to sipadan this coming end of May and wonder how could I do scuba diving while i’m not holding any qualified certificate for it. How can I register for a training course in sipadan and how much does it cost ?? and also how much does it take for a diving slot separately ???By the way, did you use a cellphone to take that video under the water ??? any recommendation for this part ???Thank you Kristin. GoPro for the under water footage. Contact SCUBA junkie about getting certified! how much is scuba diving in bali and philipines? Depends a lot on the place and whether you take a boat out or not but it’s not a budget activity. AS a PADI and SSI Instructor and avid SCUBA Diver, i am always on the lookout for a new place to dive.  Sipadan is definitely on my list.  I am going to the Galapagos this next winter and know it will be amazing.  I wondered if you have been to Raja Ampat, Indonesia?  I hear it’s absolutely insane!  Great seeing your adventures! No I probably need to do that in 2018 It may have changed since I was there four years ago but for three nights of accommodation on Mabul Island, food, dive gear, and the 9-dive Sipadan dive package, I was set back about $500. Expensive but honestly, even years later, still a travel highlight for me.  I flew into Kota Kinabalu from KL and that was dirt cheap because I was scanning deals from Air Asia beforehand. Then I motorbiked around Borneo https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/motorbike-sabah-borneo/ with some friends and arrived at the jumping off point that way. BUT you can take an overnight bus from KK, which is how I returned back to KK. That won’t cost much. Be sure to book ahead of time as well – like at least a month if you can – for the diving! your article brings back so many memories from my visit to Sipadan! I always take dive site hype with a grain of salt and try not to get overly excited, but Barracuda Point completely blew my mind and totally lived up to the expectations. I can’t wait to go back!and I have to say I really adore the photo with the kids on the boat, it’s one of my favourite shots I’ve seen so far on your blog. wow well written. Sipadan  looks to be divers paradise so much of fish that too big stuff. Also well written review felt as if we were there.I am planning to go there this April.  Just want to know abt scuba Junkie. How is the safety   culture of the  dive shop. worth, dependable, and How was the current in Sipadan is it too tiresome or  mild can be managed for 50 years old personpl reply They were a fantastic company and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them, at least when I went with them, though that was 6 years ago. Scuba-Junkie Dive Sipadan / Mabul thieves. Stay away or stay super allerted. Travellers, divers, friends. I have been diving with Scuba-Junkie.com on the 06.05.2019 and Captain from Nautilus boat that belong to Scuba Junkie Dive School have stolen money from my backpack. You would ask – how I know? Well I was ALWAYS last out for diving and first on the boat. There was only one person who had enough time to go through all my gear, when I was in the water – Boat Captain. He had 3×40 minutes and he took the chance /himself or with cooperation with Dive Master/. It is super sad that the person who is responsible of your life and your safety on the boat is a THIEF.  I dive for the past 20 years and Dive Boats were always the safest place – buy not in Sipadan Scuba-Junkie Dive Shop!!  I went to report that to the school but they did not want to listen. Their answer was – you had not cought anybody – it is your fault. They seemed like it was not the first time someone reports that and they had all answers lined up. They neither want to do ANY investigation nor take my details to send me information later. It is the worst experience ever /not to mention extremely old gear they give to divers – my gauge depth did not work and after I told them that it is broken, did not bother to change it/. They are the cheapest and there is a reason behind it!! Guess they treat divers as way to make as much money as possible not to invest on their side, and their local boat staff have the same attitude, so if they have chance they will steal from you within  a blink of an eye. So STAY AWAY OR PLEASE STAY ALLERTED IF YOU WANT TO SAFELY DIVE AND TRAVEL!! SCUBA-JUNKIE DIVERS SIPADAN / MABUL NOT RECOMENDED !!!!  Btw. Mabul / Sipadan / Semporna because of very polluted by waste (mostly plastic) environment is no longer World-Class Diving destination. You will be suprised of the amount of dirt in the water and dead coral reef :/ But for the Dive school it does not matter – people will still come as they have no idea how bad it is !!! When you arrive please take a look at the shore behind Scuba-Junkie Dive School in Mabul – full of plastic waste and Scuba- Junkie does not even care to clean it daily or pay locals to have it cleaned. Worst Scuba Dive School I have EVER seen in my life !!! Oh and cherry on pie – if you ask them – where is the toilet – they will tell you – piss in the water – it is free and easy… and they point to the area where other divers do their refreshment class. Sorry SCUBA-JUNKIE DIVERS – you should take care of the environment as you live off it, not to encourage travellers to pollute it! SHAME ON YOU! I’m sorry to hear you had a bad experience. I wasn’t sure if I should approve this comment but I am doing so because I’m curious if anyone else has been there lately and had a bad experience. I had the best experience with them, but that was years ago.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/where-to-swim-with-whales/,Want to Swim With Whales? Here’s Where to Go,Mozambique,"Ever dream of swimming with whales? In some parts of the world, it’s possible not just to view them from the deck of a boat, but to jump in the water and swim with them!  From sperm whales to humpbacks and orcas (okay so they’re in the dolphin family, but they still deserve a spot on this list, amiright?), these are the places around the world where it’s possible to swim with whales: Humpbacks are famous for their mesmerizing whale songs, which can be heard by other whales many thousands of miles away. They grow to be 50 to 60 feet long and are such strong swimmers that they sometimes propel themselves completely out of the water and into the air, called breaching. They’re often found near coastlines throughout their migration from the poles to the equator. Humpback whales are named for a small hump in front of their dorsal fin, and the underside of each humpback is unique in its pattern and pigmentation. Perhaps the coolest thing about humpbacks (besides their crazy water acrobatics) is that they sometimes blow bubbles in order to confuse and catch fish!  There are pretty tight regulations against swimming with these guys in much of the world, but there are a few places where it’s possible. If you want to swim with these cool creatures, here’s where to go: Every July through October, huge numbers of humpbacks travel north from Antarctica to Tonga to mate and calf. The best places to swim with the whales from my experience are the islands of Vava’u or Ha’apai. Only a handful of boat operators receive permits to go near the whales each year, and each boat can only take a small number of people, so booking your trip early is important. Most excursions, which are easy to book online, are five to eight days long, and prices range from about $3,500 to more than $7,000. I went with and recommend Dance with Whales. From August to October each year, humpbacks travel to Tahiti to birth their calves in the calm, warm waters off the island. Today, French Polynesia is a designated shark sanctuary and exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in order to protect its incredible marine life. Tahiti and Mo’orea are the main spots to swim with whales. You can choose from swimming with them every day, or booking a day trip and enjoying the waterfalls, swimming with rays, and other activities on Tahiti and Mo’orea as well during your trip. Tahiti Lagoon Paradise is the best-reviewed operator in Tahiti.  I also run women’s adventure tours to swim with the whales in French Polynesia. Though my trip has sold out, you can sign up for the waitlist here!  From June to November each year, approximately 40,000 whales migrate along the coastline of Ningaloo Marine Park, including Ningaloo Reef, in order to feed at the poles. Also referred to as Australia’s coral coast, Ningaloo is the site of a thriving coral reef which is home to other marine life including dolphins, rays, and turtles. Tours like these take small groups on full day excursions to swim with the migrating whales. Many are designed to have little to no impact on the marine environment in order to best support the incredible ecosystems at Ningaloo Reef. Tours are easy to book online, and prices tend to be around $300 to $500 USD. Hundreds of humpback whales travel to the coast of Mozambique each July through October to mate and calf in the Indian Ocean. The coastal town of Tofo, which is also known for its population of whale sharks, is a great home base, where you can both snorkel and dive with the whales, as well as the countless other marine creatures that call the area home.  The only bookings available online seem to be excursions on the more extravagant side, as a simple snorkeling or diving day trip is hard to come by. What is available, though, is a week-lon     g, all-inclusive trip which takes care of accommodation, activities, and more. A trip like this costs about $3,000, and though it is a hefty price tag, you’re paying for both ease and responsible, ethical travel in Mozambique. That said, Mozambique is the kind of place that I’ve learned you’re better off showing up to, and booking in person. You can read more about Mozambique travel here. The Dominican Republic’s Silver Bank is in a 650-square-mile marine sanctuary (now expanded as part of the “Sanctuary for the Marine Mammals of the Dominican Republic”) located about 50 miles north of the island. A large population of North Atlantic humpbacks gather here each winter and spring to mate and calf from the months of January through April.  Any opportunities to swim with the whales in the Dominican Republic are week-long yacht trips to the Silver Bank, not day-trips from the island, because the journey from the mainland to the Silver Bank takes about ten hours each way by boat. However, choosing to visit the Dominican Republic to swim with the whales over the course of a week means you’ll get many more chances to experience them than you would on a simple day trip. A week-long trip starts at about $4,000. A post shared by Ocean & Photography Mauritius (@vitamin_sea_ltd_mauritius) on Sep 9, 2018 at 12:05am PDT Sperm whales are the largest of the toothed whales, as they can grow to be nearly 60 feet long, and are recognizable by their huge, rounded foreheads. They can dive down more than 3,000 feet (deeper than nearly all other whales) and hold their breath for 90 minutes, which helps them in their quest to eat giant squid and 2,000 pounds of fish per day. Female whales and their calves travel in groups of 15 to 20, while male sperm whales usually travel on their own. Sperm whales are the loudest animals on the planet, as the clicking sounds they make reach such an intense frequency (more than 200 dB) that the whales can hear each other’s clicks from thousands of miles away. (To a human, sounds over 110 dB can be painful, so sperm whale sounds could blow out your eardrums!) They’re not just loud, though: they’re highly intelligent. A sperm whale’s brain is approximately six times the size of a human brain, making it the largest brain of any animal on Earth! (Another fun fact: the whale in Moby Dick is a sperm whale.) Given that they dive down so deep and can be shy, the best way to swim with them is to find a group of ‘standing’ sperm whales, which is how they sleep.  Through and through, sperm whales are gentle giants who sometimes even take interest in interacting with humans. If you’d like to experience them for yourself, contact Vitamin Sea in Mauritius.   In the winter, females and their calves can be spotted off the shores of this Caribbean island nation, which is located halfway between the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Swimming with the whales is not easy, though: permits are required, only snorkeling is allowed, and you must be accompanied by a licensed operator. What’s more, the licenses are expensive, and the country issues only ten of them per year, so the chances of acquiring one are slim. Another option is to book through a company which takes care of your whole trip, not just the swimming. However, this, too, brings a hefty price tag. It is not impossible to swim with sperm whales in Dominica, but keep in mind that this may not be an easy adventure to pull off.  Off the northern coast of Sri Lanka, sperm whales can be spotted from February to April. Tour operators must obtain a permit from the Sri Lankan government, and finding an actual day trip to swim with the whales is a challenge, as most tours are just whale watching tours. However, there are a few here and there which focus around actually swimming.  Much like in Dominica, the easiest option is perhaps to book your entire trip with a company which works out all of the details for you, though such trip is not cheap. Be prepared to spend several thousand dollars for an all-out excursion like this.  Sri Lanka is also one of the only countries in the world where you can swim with the biggest mammal in the world, the blue whale. They aren’t particularly interactive, so your best bet is to jump in the water as it passes by, like a freight train, underneath you.  Characterized by what looks like a permanent, ghostly smile, beluga whales are friendly, curious, and playful. They are the only marine mammal that is white in color, and have been dubbed the ‘sea canaries’ for their high-pitched calls. They have highly adapted echolocation, which allows them to live in areas with ice, like Canada! Here’s where to see them:  Each summer between June and mid-September, up to 60,000 of them swim into the brackish water of the Hudson Bay where the temperature is slightly warmer and more hospitable for their calves. Summer trips here include kayaking, boating, and floating in the water in drysuits as the whales come and check you out. They’re a joy to interact with, often coming up and bumping the kayak or swimming up to you while you float in the water. The water visibility isn’t great, but the experience is magical. Trips also include looking for polar bears and dog sledding. You can find out more about the trip and how to book here.  Often called killer whales, orcas are actually in the dolphin family, but they deserve a spot on this list because they’re beautiful and amazing and would be a joy to swim with. They are also some of the deadliest creatures in the ocean. They are so successful predatorily not only because they have up to four-inch long teeth, but because they are smart! They use their intelligence and social ability to work together and outsmart their ocean prey. They can even hunt great white sharks! Orcas travel in pods of up to 40, so if you see one, there’ll be dozens more close by. Here’s where to swim with orcas: From the end of October to the beginning of February, the Tromsø region in the far north of Norway is perhaps the best place to see killer whales in their natural habitat, thanks to the high concentration of herring which brings thousands of orcas (and humpbacks, too) all to one geographical location.  Scuba diving typically is not necessary, as the whales remain pretty close to the surface, but snorkeling and swimming are common each winter. Luckily, the orcas are not on the hunt for anything but fish, so they won’t take any interest in you; however, since orcas can be dangerous, swimming with them must be strictly organized and supervised so that participants are not at great risk.  A multi-day excursion in Norway and the Arctic Circle starts at about $2,500, while week-long trips climb to $5,000 with some even reaching $8,000. Because an adventure like this must be so tightly planned and regulated, spots are few and planning ahead is important. Booking online is easy, though, and there are many tours and excursions to choose from.  Is it ethical to swim with whales? This is something we always have to consider when seeking animal encounters, and it’s rarely a black and white answer. From my personal experience swimming with humpbacks, I can say with certainty that they choose to swim with us, coming back around over and over and locking eyes with us as we snorkel and freedive down with them. It’s very easy for them to swim away, and we do not lure them, so they make the choice.  That said, it’s important that they are respected, which is why Tonga offers so few permits. Tahiti on the other hand, sometimes sees many people in the water with them at a time. Hopefully there are eventually tighter regulations. Elsewhere in the world, they can be more elusive to find.  Another thing to keep in mind is whether or not the tour guide you’re booking feeds the whales, which is unethical. Some people report having taken tours which used bait balls to lure the orcas, which is a red flag. Often, these practices disturb the natural patterns and habits of marine animals; this has also become a problem with whale sharks in the Philippines.  It’s also important to respect boundaries with these wild animals. Never initiate touch with whales, as it can disturb their natural behavior, and we don’t know how the bacteria on our bodies might affect them.  Ask questions before you book, and make sure you feel good about the answers you receive.  Swimming with whales is one of the hands-down, coolest things I’ve ever done, which is why I can’t get enough of it now! I hope this post helps you to find an option that feels good to you, so that you get to experience this, too.  Hi Kristin, I wanted to point out an inaccuracy in your description of where to swim with humpback whales.  For Tonga, you mentioned Vava’u & Haapai being the best place to swim with whales and stated one of the reasons being that only a handful of operators are given licenses there.   I work in the whale swim industry and can give you some figures related to that statement.  For the 2019 season there were 22 Operators in Vava’u with a combined total of 37 whale watching boats.   Whale swim regulations stipulate that only four people can be in the water with a guide at any point for a limited time frame and that you must give the whales breaks in between swims.  With that many operators on the water in Vava’u, the chances of “waiting in line” behind other boats is often the norm.   In Haapai there were 8 operators and 15 boats.  Compare that to the 7 operators on Tongatapu with a total of 9 boats.   – and the 3 operators on ‘Eua with 5 boats. If you are basing the recommendation on the least number of competing operators & boats, then Tongatapu & ‘Eua is where you would want to go to experience whale swims.  This information can be obtained from the Tongan Ministry of Tourism.   Thanks! I stand by my recommendation, since I had a great experience in Vava’u and heard good things about Haapai, but thanks for the info on the other places! Hi Daphne! I read your comment and had some thoughts. Enjoyed your thorough analysis and glad people are reading carefully what is posted here, shows you all care and want to help!1. I believe the comments on a “handful of boats” was in reference to the need to book the trip early to secure a spot as it was part of the next paragraph which had this theme. I also think it was meant to imply there are not that many that get permits with only a limited number on each boat so not a lot of spots. It appears, based on your spot-on data, regarding operators that there are somewhere around 30 operators in Vava’u and Haa’pai (matching your source), so about 10 permits a year (a permit lasts 3 years). That can be considered a handful (generally viewed as 3-10, but no defined amount, just a “small amount”), at least of boat operators.2. As for best place to swim with whales, that seems here to be based on a person’s experience which can include factors like: how rough the water is (is the area protected from strong winds?), the quality of boat operators available (easy to deal with? ethical?), how you like the island itself you are on, the success of the swim, etc.3. Sadly, in 2018 when Kristin went there was (and probably even is some need today!) recovery from Cyclone Gita still going on in Tongatapu and ‘Eua. I am sure the boat operators got themselves back online (although I thought 2018 ‘Eua season was lost 🙁 ), and some other tourism areas were rebuilt quickly, but still it is best in my opinion to stay out of their way until they recover. I have no idea if this was a factor at all with this post or author, but might have been for others who might have traveled then.  I hope those islands’ residents recover fully soon! Just guesses! However, if someone did want to base their choice on fewer boats and smaller crowds you info seems great!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/swimming-with-whale-sharks/,Where in the World to Swim with Whale Sharks,Mozambique,"Swimming with whale sharks is one of the most exciting and awe-inspiring aquatic experiences. Apart from swimming with humpback whales, shark swimming is my favorite ocean activity, in part due to how huge they are.  Not only are whale sharks the largest sharks in the ocean, they’re second only to some whale species when it comes to ocean animal size, and are the largest ‘fish in the sea’. These spotted and striped fellas can be as long as a school bus — 40 feet long or more – that’s up to three times as big as a great white! Gasp! Sharks? Aren’t those dangerous? Thankfully whale sharks are gentle giants: they have tiny teeth, and they don’t really use them anyway. Whale sharks are filter feeders, so they use their five-foot-wide mouths to eat mostly plankton. Since they are so massive, they live in practically no danger of being hunted by predators, so they have life spans similar to and exceeding those of humans, ranging from 70 to even 130 years! While whale sharks are found mostly in tropical seas, as they choose to live in warm waters, they can be seen all over the world and on five of the seven continents. Since they migrate, the best time to see them varies from place to place. Here are the best places around the globe to swim with whale sharks: Mexico is home to several different whale shark habitats. Off the coast of Cancun is Isla Mujeres, a popular spot for divers and snorkelers. From May to September, the whale sharks migrate south past the island, and the annual Whale Shark Festival takes place there every July.  Another option, the nearby Isla Holbox, is 40 miles northwest of Cancun and sees the same migration as Isla Mujeres. Holbox is actually home to one of the largest whale shark populations in the world. Meanwhile, the tiny Isla Contoy is a Mexican national park which regulates eco-tourism including diving with whale sharks. Whale sharks can be found around the Baja California region as well. La Paz, on the south and eastern coast of the Baja peninsula, sees whale sharks from November to May. In all of these locations, booking an excursion is easy!  The Gladden Spit and Silk Cayes Marine Reserve protects the central part of Belize’s Barrier Reef off the southern coast. From March to June, whale sharks gather in the waters of the reserve to feed. Swimming with the sharks is fairly easy, as several local tour companies run excursions with them. Prices seem to be higher here than in Mexico (at around $200) as some of them are SCUBA diving excursions, not just snorkeling trips.  Booking isn’t quite as straightforward, either: there are plenty of companies with tour listings online, but many do not display their prices or offer online booking. Also important to know is that dive operators can only work within the restrictions of the reserve, so it is best to book a spot on a trip well in advance, which might require picking up the phone and inquiring that way, or showing up in person if you have a bit more time to work with.  The tiny Isla del Caño, ten miles southwest of mainland Costa Rica, is a protected biological reserve with crystal clear waters. The island is rumored to be Costa Rica’s best spot for snorkeling, as swimmers can see turtles, rays, and other species of shark, too.  The whale sharks are believed to most likely visit the area June to September and November to January; however, this destination is certainly more “off the grid” than many others, so booking an excursion online to see the whale sharks here is somewhat difficult. Like many options on this list, it’s best to visit and organize in person.  The island of Utila, off the northern coast of Honduras, is one of the most famous whale shark viewing spots, as the sharks swim near to the shore all year long, not just for a few months. The island is also home to the Whale Shark and Oceanic Research Center, which studies the population and movement patterns of the sharks.  Roatan Island is another great spot to see the whale sharks, particularly between the months of May and September. The diving there is exceptional because the island’s proximity to the world’s second largest barrier reef results in diverse marine life. Since the islands are well-known for diving, booking a guide to see the whale sharks should be no trouble at all. A diving trip alone typically falls between $150 and $200. Coiba National Park is a protected marine reserve off the southwestern mainland coast of Panama. Here, whale sharks can be seen close to land from January to April. Tours to swim with the whale sharks run from Puerto Mutis, El Banco, or most commonly, the fishing village of Santa Catalina. Most diving trips seem to range around $150, while snorkeling trips are much cheaper at about $30, and many of these excursions are available for easy booking online. While the whale shark season is brief, the months of June through October bring orcas and humpbacks, so Coiba is a great destination for seeing marine life no matter when you visit.  Off the northwestern coast of Madagascar, the island of Nosy Be is home to large numbers of young whale sharks which come to feed in September through December. Countless other species besides whale sharks have made Nosy Be home, contributing to the island’s reputation for amazing diving.  Booking an excursion in Nosy Be is easy online, as underwater activities are the island’s greatest tourist pull. While Nosy Be is the most expensive destination in Madagascar, it still pales in comparison to many other places around the world: rates tend to hover around $75 for a one-day diving trip.   Mafia Island, off the east coast of Tanzania, offers an optimal whale shark spotting season from September/October to February/March, a little longer than Madagascar. The island sees a large population of whale sharks, which is unusual for how near the island is to the African continent.  While there are seasons of optimal viewing, like Utila, Mafia sees sharks all year long, making it an important destination for marine biological research. Booking a swim with the whale sharks costs about $60 to $100 and is possible online or in person.  Mozambique offers great opportunities to see and swim with whale sharks in Tofo, 300 miles northeast of the capital city of Maputo. Huge numbers of plankton guarantee one of the largest whale shark populations anywhere in the world. November through February is the best time to go, as waters are both clear and warm enough for great shark spotting. The whale sharks float close to the surface here, so even snorkelers should be able to see them without going too far below the surface.  Most of the dive tour companies do not offer online booking, unfortunately, but the sticker prices make up for it: a snorkeling trip to see whale sharks, manta rays, devil rays, dolphins, and turtles costs less than $60. In my case, after a SCUBA dive, my guide spotted some whale sharks and let me jump in, so it’s possible to see them on dive trips as well. There are just four dive companies in Tofo, all of which are easy to reach on foot from wherever you might be staying. A surge of plankton brings groups of whale sharks to the upper Red Sea region each May to July. The sharks appear mainly in the very north of the Red Sea (adjacent to Egypt), having migrated from the central Red Sea region (e.g., Sudan and Saudi Arabia), originating in large clusters in the southern part (near Djibouti). In Egypt, some popular spots are the city of Sharm El-Sheikh, which has clear waters perfect for diving, and the town of Marsa Alam, popular for its coral reefs. Several dive tours in each place are easily available for booking online, and most diving and snorkeling excursions cost around $50 to $100. Since Djibouti is situated on the southern part of the Red Sea, it is even closer to the Indian Ocean and therefore the ocean’s strong currents bring in all kinds of marine animals. Here you’ll find at least 200 marine species native to the country, and thanks to that biodiversity, whale sharks love to hang out along the Djibouti coast. They’re most visible from November to February, and the best places to see them are the Bay of Ghoubbet, an inlet which stretches nearly halfway into the country from the Indian Ocean, and the Island of the Devil, which is surrounded by plankton which attract the sharks.  Prices for day-long excursions hover around $100 for snorkeling and $150 for diving, and most tour companies do their booking online.   South Ari Atoll in the Maldives is a Marine Protected Area which sees whale sharks year round, rotating from one side of the island to the other depending on the season. Tours are available to swim with the sharks at all times of the year, so booking an excursion should be easy.  Prices usually center around $100 for a day-long diving trip. The Maldives Whale Shark Research Programme has even created an app which allows you to track whale shark sightings to better plan your trip! I had a fantastic experience with a whale shark here, swimming with the same one for over 45 minutes (without feeding). Compared to my super brief Mozambique experience, this one was quite magical, though there were tons of other tourists in the water with me.  While the most popular location for swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines is Oslob in Cebu, the practices for swimming with the sharks there are often questionable and can be harmful to the sharks themselves. Whale sharks don’t naturally gather there, so the ways in which tour guides use food to lure them to groups of tourists is highly unethical. Not to worry, there are other options that are more ethical! Donsol Bay, at the southern tip of island of Luzon, is a much better option thanks to the way locals protect the whale sharks. Donsol Bay has a “no diving – snorkeling only” rule, as the sharks are well visible to snorkelers and there is no need to further disturb the aquatic ecosystem. While the whale sharks do not hang out in the Philippines here year-round, they do spend a good half of the year here, from December to May. Tours are best booked in person.  The island of Ko Tao is the perfect spot for cheap but beautiful diving in the Gulf of Thailand, another destination where whale sharks hang out year-round. The island usually sees younger, smaller whale sharks which are often curious and playful with divers, as well as rays and turtles.  Here, seeing the whale sharks typically requires actual diving, not just snorkeling. However, a day-long diving trip only costs around $50 to $60! These are usually best booked in person.  Part of the Coral Coast of Western Australia, Ningaloo Reef is the world’s largest fringing coral reef. Ningaloo is home to more than 300 species of sea animals and sees large numbers of whale sharks from early spring to late fall. Here, they hang out just below the surface of the clear waters, so diving isn’t even necessary to see them.  Australia might be one of the most expensive destinations to swim with whale sharks, though: many tours have a sticker price of about $300 (here’s an option for $275, or even $196). Luckily, the tours are highly-rated and include transport, snacks, and professional photos.  Though rare, whale sharks can show up just about anywhere, like Hawaii, French Polynesia, and more.  If you do get the privilege to swim with them, please don’t touch, or chase, and just admire. There are few experiences as profound and beautiful as swimming with such a large, gentle creature.  *Some links in this post are affiliate links that support this site at no extra cost to you. If you do book a tour, consider booking through one of these links. Many thanks! Such amazing creatures!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/africa-packing-list/,"An Easy, Fashionable Africa Packing List",Mozambique,"“What in the world do people pack when they go to Africa? Where do I start? What is essential and what should I leave behind?” This was my question before I went to Africa for the first time, heading to South Africa with a backpack full of denim shorts and tank tops, kind of clueless about what was and wasn’t cool to wear there. It turned out that in most of Southern Africa, people dressed just like where I’m from in California – it’s all about fashion, feeling comfortable, and keeping it laid back. In Africa, you’ll see all kinds of interesting fashion decisions. I have to laugh to myself a little bit each time I travel there and see foreigners like me decked out head to toe in beige and olive green safari gear. They’ve got the vests, the hats, and the pants that zip off at the knee. Honestly, what do they think they’re going to need that for? You’re not even allowed to get out of the safari vehicles when in the wildlife areas, because of, you know, lions, hippos, and buffalo. While you can most certainly make the safari chic work for you by opting for the more stylish and modern cousins of the original, it’s also totally fine to go for the same cute clothes you’d wear at home, while keeping a few general rules in mind:  Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Africa here: Also, if you’ll be traveling to Cape Town, leave a little room in your bag to do some shopping. The local designers there are talented and have access to super cool fabrics, and the exchange rate, at least right now, is in your favor if on the Euro, Dollar, and GBP. I got custom shoes and these adorable shorts for way less than I would have at home. Each time I travel to Africa, I tend to bring my Pacsafe 55L backpack with me. It’s lined with Exomesh which makes it slash-proof, the zippers lock, and it has RFID-blocking technology so that theives can’t ‘bump into’ me and scan my credit card and passport info. I also bring along a smaller cross-body purse and wallet that has space for multiple currencies. They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well. I make myself the least attractive target that way. I also lock up my belongings in my Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa. Sadly, it’s often pressure from local mobsters on the people working in the hotels, or desperation given how low the wages are in most of Africa. There are a few more absolute essentials that you should bring from home that you will struggle to find in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and major cities like Nairobi, Kigali, and Lusaka: If you’re camping, I highly recommend the following: Insurance, immunizations, and meds: Travel insurance is an important addition to this packing list because it keeps you covered in the worst case scenario, which is being flown to a country where you can get the proper care you need. I use World Nomads since their explorer option also covers adventurous activities like hiking and scuba diving. You might be surprised to find that in major cities in Africa, like Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi, and surely plenty of others, immunizations and anti-malarial pills are way cheaper and often don’t require a prescription. I always buy my anti-malarials on the ground (though it’s important to take them before you will be exposed, so plan ahead). Keep in mind, Africa is huge, and this list is meant for those traveling through the southern and eastern countries with some suggestions for the far north as well. If you’re just sticking to South Africa, modesty isn’t a big concern and staples like hair products and sunscreen are easy to replace, but as you head more north and east, expect things to get a lot more lean and basic and you may be shocked at how difficult it is to find things that are totally common back home. Plan ahead and you’ll have a blast! Enjoy the beautiful adventure in comfort and style, and not in head-to-toe beige safari gear! *Some of these links are affiliate links and BMTM sponsors. Anything you purchase helps to support this site at absolutely no additional cost to you. Much love!  Everything on this list is SO cute. I’m so not with it when it comes to packing right. haha. I ALWAYS pack 50% OK stuff and the other half is “wtf was I thinking.” I’m getting better though! I really like to safari shorts for anytime actually! And all the unicorn things… I need unicorn things! haha. I wish I was a hat person but my hair is too big. lol. Thanks for this info, Kristin! I used to pack pretty badly too but I’m getting a lot better now. Lots of trial and error! I love hats because that African sun is intense! Hi Kristin,Thanks as always for the amazing posts.Did you use the same Ariat hiking boots in Kyrgystan?Thank you! I did not, I used another pair I have from Quechua and they’re not as nice. Lesson learned. Hi Kristin,Saw this post and guess what, I’m currently in Cape Town and want to do a little shopping? Where would you recommend? I found some awesome boutiques with stuff made by local designers on Long Street and in Woodstock. Check out the Neighbourhood Goods Market on Saturdays too. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I’m planning to spend some time in east Africa alone next year – an overland trek, some time in Kigali and maybe Tanzania and a couple of days in Nairobi. This is the part I’m worried about. I’d like to go to the David Sheldrick wildlife trust and maybe a few other places and I want to stay somewhere inexpensive. Are hostels a safe place to stay in Nairobi for a single woman traveler? I think you mentioned them but they sound a bit sketchy….probably the stereotypical Nairobi fear that you spoke of. Where do you stay in Nairobi if just for a few days.Thank you,Gina I haven’t actually been to Nairobi but have been to other big cities in the area like Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha, Kigali, and Kampala. I would just only walk during the day, and take cabs longer distances or at night. Ask at your hostel where is safe to go and where isn’t. Most hostels are locked with guards and plenty of other travelers, so I’ve felt OK in them. Have fun! Hi. I’m planning on a three months trip whatever I have time for of Malawi, Mosambik, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. I consider going alone as a female 27 years old and will use my experience of solo travels through south east asia and tanzania with a girl friend of mine. I want to travel with hand luggage, but I guess that is not a good idea if I will have to cary a bunch of sun screen to some places!? I am typical scandinavian with light skin and blonde hair. Also I wonder what is the easiest way to get from country to country? Where should I begin my trip? Thank you 🙂 Sunscreen is a good idea, especially since it’s hard to find once you reach East Africa, apart from in big cities. You could just bring several small bottles. As much as I hate suggesting so many small plastic items, it’ll help you go carry on only. It makes sense to fly into South Africa and go through Namibia to Botswana and work your way up and east. Local buses really suck, but they work. You can also sometimes take trains and long distance buses, or join an overland tour. This packing list is helpful. I am off for Cape Town in April. Thanks Have fun! What did you pack for an adapter so you could use hair tools?  I would like to bring a curling iron or straightener but most adapters I see say not to use hair tools with them! I don’t own any curling irons or straighteners! Sorry I can’t help more. HI Kristin thank you for writing everything in detail. I checked overland tours from Kenya to Tanzania nd they are super expensive, starting g from 1500 USD. Flight is even more expensive. I am travelinging solo, what will be the best way to travel between Zanzibar, Tanzania and Kenya? Not sure how many days that is but if you’re solo that might be the best way to go – something like an Acacia Africa or G adventures is the cheapest. Otherwise you can do public transport but I have to warn you it’s rough in that part of the world. Overcrowded vans with bald tires and massive delays constantly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mozambique-travel-blog/,How to Travel Through Mozambique,Mozambique,"Mozambique is one of the most stunning countries for those who love beaches and marvelous coastline. If you love diving, quad biking, fresh seafood, and hanging in hammocks, Mozambique is one of those awesome budget beach destinations that few frequent. If you’ve heard that Mozambique is difficult to travel through, I hate to say it’s entirely true. I can tell you, however, that it’s worth the pains to get around, because once you do reach your end destination, it’s sure to be stunning and the journey is half the adventure. Previously, it was simple enough to get a visa on arrival at the airport or at land crossings into Mozambique. Recently, reports of Americans being denied entry at the border for not sorting out a visa ahead of time have surfaced, which means if you hail from the USA, you have to figure out the visa before you go. The rules for other nationalities are (at least for now) as follows: If your country has a consulate or embassy for Mozambique, you are expected to obtain a visa ahead of time, unless you’re from one of the eight bordering countries, residents of which can travel to Mozambique visa-free. I obtained my visa easily and on the same day at the consulate in Johannesburg. There is also one in Pretoria but it seemed silly to travel for an hour to get there when there was a consulate much closer to me in the city. There wasn’t much info online so I tried my luck and just showed up, which worked out. To do the same, you will need: To get to Mozambique from abroad you will probably have to route through Johannesburg or another close airport. In some cases the flight onwards to Tofo or Maputo is prohibitively expensive, but luckily the busses to Maputo from Joburg aren’t too bad. I took an Intercape bus that took 10 hours, was air-conditioned, and was comfortable. Greyhound also offers a similar option. From Maputo, I took a 10-hour chapa to Tofo, which was a long and cramped experience but it’s the reality of traveling in Mozambique. There is no simple or straightforward way to travel through Mozambique, I’m sorry to say. The following options are available but none are ideal: Chapas: Van taxis that stop often to pick people up and will try very hard to overcharge you if you don’t already know the price, and you’ll still overpay, that’s a guarantee. They are usually set to depart at 4am and will drive around for several hours finding people to pick up before they leave. It’s frustrating but it’s just how it is. These vans are not in good condition, and they are usually filled to way over capacity, driving on bald tires on bad roads. I elected never to take a chapa again when, during my last ride, the driver swerved and I saw him taking a swig of beer while driving. Car Rental: If you bring a car through, chances are you’ll rent it in South Africa first. Most companies won’t let you bring a car rental to Mozambique but a few will. In those cases, make sure you have the proper documentation that allows you to drive across the border. Another unavoidable byproduct of driving will be the police soliciting bribes. They will find a reason, no matter what, to pull you over. For example, two girls I met in Moz were pulled over and fined for having bags in the back seat because, “seats are for people, not bags.” There’s not much you can do in this case but haggle them down. Chances are good that you won’t have to pay much over the equivalent of $10 or $20 unless they really get angry with you. Hitchhiking: Hitchhiking and chapas were my main modes of transport in Mozambique, and while hitchhiking always has an element of risk, so does taking a chapa. Speaking Portuguese will help monumentally but as long as you ask around and find a logical spot for a ride, you probably won’t have to wait too long to get one. In some cases the driver will want a tip, but I was never asked for one. Though I’ve hitchhiked alone in China, I spoke the language there and without knowledge of Portuguese, I suggest you at least go in pairs. Flying: I hate to dole out more horror stories, but two of my friends tried to leave Mozambique via airplane and three times, encountered technical issues mid-flight and had to turn around, because the only city with a mechanic is Maputo. Other friends experienced delays for days. I flew out of Vilanculos back to South Africa at the end of my trip without any issues, apart from having to go to the airport to book the ticket because the online booking system was, of course, not working. By then I had already accepted that’s just how Moz is. If you can fly South African Airways as opposed to LAM, do so. I didn’t hear much positivity about traveling to Mozambique prior to my trip. I was told that I’d get robbed in Maputo, that the border crossing would involve bribes, and that I might get pick pocketed. None of that turned out to be true and I actually really liked Maputo, and found Mozambicans to be generous and kind. I just did what I always do – I stayed aware of my surroundings, brought a bag lock, which is a good idea in Mozambique where I never saw lockers, and when I did things like hitchhike or walk at night, I did so with others. I treated locals with respect and when I haggled, I did so with a smile. Mozambique isn’t easy, but it is worth it. I loved my time there and can’t wait to return. So what exactly is a biometric passport photo?? It sounds cool and maybe a little painful… Just means the size that is suitable for a passport Girl I just want to go everywhere that you write about. Your travel style is exactly like mine and literally every place you go I end up wishing I could visit right this minute. You’re killing me with Mozambique posts! It sounds like it’s totally worth the hassle to get there. Aw that’s awesome feedback. You’ll get there eventually. It’s not changing super fast over there 🙂 It’s really great to read and learn a lot about Mozambique and the pretty things that you can do there. Last year we traveled to Tanzania and it as really fun. We are planning to tour that region again and who knows, maybe we may decide its Mozambique.Thanks a lot for sharing this, really appreciated. Cindy Tanzania is beautiful too! Thanks for the information, what about renting a car from agencies in Mozambique? is that an option? Thanks Yes but they are hard to find and most people just drive in from South Africa. Be prepared for the police to stop you and solicit bribes often if you drive, though Thanks for sharing most up to date travel news on Mozambique.  It is hard to find something on 🙂Planing to travel there first week of October and trying to get any detailed information on bus station in maputo for tofu or Vilankulos.And I know that,they over price tourist but even if we bargain for the price, do you know the prices?  Also I read really bad stories about Fatima place in Maputo.. Not.sure what to belive.Also would like to flyback to Johannesburg from Vilankulos, do you think I should book flight on line or there? Thanks 🙂Nina Hi Nina, I really liked Fatima’s in Maputo but that’s because I met some awesome people there and had an amazing time. I also only spent a few hours sleeping there before getting on the bus.  Busses leave when they are full, you’ll pay more if you take it from Fatima’s (I think it was something like $15) but they’ll take care of the transport for you, which is nice, or if you want to be intrepid you can go on your own and for sure get it cheaper, but you’ll have to handle it all, which I realized when I was there isn’t all that difficult, it’s just a little overwhelming and frustrating at times. Such is travel in much of the world.  Hello!Thank you for all your tips. Could you tell me what your itinerary through Mozambique  was?I am seriously wondering about getting there very soon from Johannesburg, alone as you were. Thanks again for all your great posts and positivity!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/vilanculos-mozambique/,"The People You Meet in Vilanculos, Mozambique",Mozambique,"On an oppressively hot November afternoon, a few of my Tofo friends and I rode in the back of a flat-bed truck on our way to Vilanculos, Mozambique, just 200-ish kilometers up the coast from Tofo. Hitching a ride in Mozambique is common – it’s called a getting a boleia. The flat-bed truck could only take us so far, so we got in a chapa – a local bus/van with bald tires and far too many people inside – to the next town. From there, I held my hand up and we got another ride in the back of a pickup truck, the hot African sun beaming down on us, and the mango trees, heavy with the weight of fresh orange fruit, lining the road. It was beautiful, until we got to the next dusty town where our driver was ending his journey. From there, after unsuccessfully trying to get a boleia for an hour, we finally took a chapa, and then another chapa, which had a drunk driver swigging a beer as he drove. We stumbled into the backpackers well after dark, sweaty, dusty, and exhausted. The ride had taken seven hours to go a rather short distance. Such is Mozambique. The long and frustrating day was the perfect example of what it’s like to travel in Moz. You have days spent diving in clear blue waters and lounging in a hammock for hours with amazing people and delicious food, and then you have days that are so frustrating you want to tear your hair out. It’s one of the most extreme places I’ve been to in this regard yet I can’t help but love it. The next day the sun rose over Vilanculos and I forgot all about the previous day’s unwelcome adventure. When the tide went out, there were miles upon miles of sand bars as far as the eye could see. I could spend the rest of this post talking about how peaceful the beach was, with fishermen tending to a day’s work: Or how the kids played gleefully: I could talk about how amazing (however expensive at $140 for just two tanks) the SCUBA diving was: Or how the locals made the best of their beautiful surroundings, and even swam out to the sand bars with a ball in tow for a game of soccer: We could talk about how I spent more time in the water than out of it, and how dazzling the stars, how bright the moon in the sky: Or we could even talk about how I had this rondavel, a round hut with a double bed, two chairs, a mosquito net (with no holes!), and a functioning fan that only cost me $19 per night: And while all of those things made Vilanculos special, it was the people I met there who made it memorable for me. I had fun nights with new friends and with locals, but my favorite encounter of all was with Nate and Orlando. Nate is a 21-year-old guy who has been living and working in the wilderness of Alaska. He’s well-traveled and came to Mozambique by word of mouth like I did. He had also spent some time in Tofo where he met Orlando, the local quad bike rental guy. Orlando invited Nate to his village just behind the beach in the palm trees – a little place where the kids playfully grab onto your quad as you pass by and try to run behind you, and the ladies sell coconut wine. It’s just a few grass and bamboo huts and it’s all that Orlando had ever known. Nate got to know Orlando during his time in Tofo, and decided that it was a shame that Orlando had never even seen his own country. He’d never seen mountains, never felt the cold, and never knew anything other than the area immediately around him. Then Nate did something extraordinary – he invited Orlando to join him on his trip through Mozambique, and offered to pay his way. The relationship made sense in so many ways. Orlando got to see his country, and Nate got to have a true local experience. The day I met them, we decided to go down to the beach and buy a fish from a local fisherman. We got a big one, the size and taste of a tuna, for around $6 thanks to Orlando’s negotiating. Nate filleted the fish and Orlando got to cooking. First he cooked a fish soup with potatoes and carrots, then a fish filet which we ate with coconut rice and matapa – a local green leafy vegetable smashed and cooked with coconut milk. We bought Orlando beers and I did the dishes after, splitting the work. That night we went down to the ocean and pointed out the constellations to Orlando. He was smiling from ear to ear, seeing a beach he’d never seen before in his life. Nate’s was such a beautiful gesture, and it made wonder why more people don’t do this. It’s a small way of giving back but in such a generous and kind way. Their story inspired me so much, I asked them if I could share it with you, and thankfully they said yes. I hope that they made it to the mountains, and I hope that Orlando saw more amazing things that he’d never had the opportunity to see before. As for me, Vilanculos was my last stop in Moz, and as I flew out over the sand bars back to South Africa, I silently promised to find a way back one day – just not on a chapa. Wow.  What beautiful subject matter in your photos!  I can’t imagine someone reading your post and not wanting to go there, not now, but right now!  You had an incredible journey and shared it well.  I take it this was a two or three day side trip.  I wish I’d been as adventurous when I was young.   I enjoyed your post very much. I stayed in Vilanculos for six days I think. I was really good at just lounging all day when I was there. Plus, when you have to budget two hours for every meal, there’s not a lot you can get done in a day. Life moves very slowly there Beautiful! Thank you for that! Oh my word, that picture as you were flying out… friggin magical. I know! I was looking into booking a scenic flight but they were over $400 so that was disappointing, then when the plane flew out over the water I was SO GLAD that I got to see it anyways! Wow, that is a sensational idea by Nate. So fun. Sitting atop Bazaruto island just off of Vil…the photo with this caption, self timer? If so I need to get to taking them more often. Also, um coconut wine?YES PLEASE Funny how things changed. Exactly in the same backpackers 5 years ago we have been robbed (Backpacker Staff and guards were cooperating with local thieves and surprise surprise with corrupted so called ‘police’!) Except of that we heard horror stories of staff stealing money/valuable things from people staying there…Happy it has changed though. Still, having the worst experience happen there it still has been the most beautiful place I have ever seen. Will definetely try to go back there one day. This was at Baobab specifically?? I’m surprised! This is very interesting and informative especially from someone who is at the other side of the globe. Thanks for sharing! Sparks the wanderlust in me! We’re going to Vilanculos for 8 nights, then Barra for 7, for our honeymoon (with two nights in Maputo on either end of the trip). Diving, horse riding, chilling, seafood…can’t wait. Glad to see you stayed there for 6 days…it’s the same length of full days we’ll have there in June.  Any places to go/things to do (aside from diving, dhaow boats etc) would be highly appreciated, don’t know anyone who’s been to Moz – and there’s really so little info out there! Thanks in advance!!Nat Go diving! Love it! I’m headed nearby for my cousin’s wedding on the beach and about 10 days of lounging. Wondering if I should head south afterwards to see more of Moz or if I should fly to Madagascar from there. Any thoughts? I haven’t been to Madagascar but I think if all you want to do is lounge I’d head to Tofo in Moz.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tofo-mozambique/,"Tofo, Mozambique: Paradise You Never Knew Existed",Mozambique,"I know of a place that few others do. It’s the kind of place where the silica-rich sand squeaks beneath your feet, you stop wearing shoes of any kind, don’t even think about brushing your hair, and since there aren’t any mirrors around, you stop thinking about how you look, too. It starts to become all about how you feel, which is relaxed and like your soul is getting a nice cleanse. The water is perfect for goldilocks types – not too warm and not too cold. It’s just right. The weather is also perfect in November- not too humid, not too hot, and there’s a nice breeze. It’s perfectly acceptable to lounge in a hammock all day while staring at the perfectly blue water and truth be told, I often do. The beach isn’t all that long. One can walk from one end to the other in less than an hour, skipping from the lighthouse on over to the sunset point. On the way you’ll pass by a couple of diving schools as Tofo in Mozambique is a popular diving spot. It’s famous for the big stuff like Manta Rays and such. I can vouch, I saw a whale shark there. Of course it’s not all perfection. Sometimes the power goes off and yes, there is a mosquito here and there. The journey to get to Tofo is a treacherous one full of 10-hour overcrowded bus journeys that replace every single other horrific bus journey I’ve taken times ten. The nearest ATM is a 30-minute walk away, and even flights tend to go days with cancellation after cancellation. But when I can stay in my own bamboo bungalow for $15 per night and a plate of fresh barracuda only sets me back $5, these are small detractors, and I can get over the inconvenience. There are a few backpackers accommodations which consist of beach huts and camp sites, one fancy-ish hotel, a small market where they sell the world’s best mango for 5 mets (like, not even 10 cents), along with fresh lobster, barracuda, and prawns, and a couple of open-air restaurants where the food takes an hour or two to arrive. It’s just the way it goes in a place where life moves slowly. Unlike most beaches this pristine and beautiful, Tofo’s tourism appears to be on the decline. This is probably due to the difficulty of traveling there, the scarce information about the place, and the falling value of the South African Rand, and therefore dropping tourist numbers. While quad biking around the dunes and coconut tree forests behind the main beach, I can see that construction was started only to be abandoned on several resorts. One in particular only has one bungalow left after a fire, yet it’s still fully staffed. I took the chance to have a whole resort to myself and booked the villa for one night. It was creepy yet incredible at the same time to have the entire secluded mangrove for miles. Like the beaches in developing countries the world over, touts roam the sand with bracelets and sarongs. The most persistent of them approaches me daily to sell me a coconut we both know I’ll buy. We also both know I won’t pay more than 20 mets (39 cents) for it, but we still haggle for a good ten minutes anyways because it’s a sport and we have time to kill. He repeats the same questions: “how much you pay for a coconut? When are you leaving? Where are you from? So you buy a coconut tomorrow? How much you pay for a coconut tomorrow?”, rolling his Rs heavily on the double R in tomorrow, in the way that a native speaker of Portuguese does. Eventually I come to really enjoy the daily interactions with this kid who swears he’s 18 but looks 16, and I respect the hustle. In another part of the world he’d be an insurance salesman and he’d be damn good at it. It’s like any paradise for pennies on the dollar. It’s a beautiful place for a nominal fee that you get to enjoy immensely while simultaneously asking yourself why it is that you were put on this earth with the passport that lets you travel, had access to free schools, and lived in a place where child labor is illegal. You enjoy for it for so little while knowing that it isn’t fair that you get to do this. But when you wander out to the beach for the sunrise and find you’re the only one there, save for the fishermen who pass by on their way to the point from time to time, the feeling that replaces all others is awe. It’s awe for the present moment, and the recognition that no matter who you are and what your means may be, that if you get to stare at this beach, you are truly lucky. Dang. I felt all relaxed and beachy just reading this! Thanks for telling us about this place. I’m enjoying getting a little break from the usual travel destinations I read about. Also, I’m SO jealous that you saw a whale shark!! Snorkeling with them is on my bucket list 🙂Amazing photos, as always. Thanks for a glimpse of warm, sandy joy during this cold and yucky midwest day! It was a little nerve wracking to go somewhere with almost no coverage but also pretty cool to be the first solo female traveler to blog about going to Mozambique 🙂 Glad you like reading about it! Hi Kristin,Thanks for your blog.  I am heading to SA in June/July then up to Mozambique.  It’s been on my bucket list for the last 15 years.  I am trying to figure out the best way to get there from CPT.  We will have a car so I thought we could drive up there, if we do, do you think we would be OK driving to Tofo?  OR do you think it be better flying to Maputo?  Then getting our way to Tofo.  I am a keen diver and want to see the big stuff, do you know if the dive shops rent all the equipment and do you have a shop you can recommend?Can’t wait to finally see Moz.Thank you in advanceTracey You can drive in, but the police will pull you over at some point and solicit a bribe. Make sure you don’t have any contraband that they could possibly find in the car, or they’ll want more $$. I’d bring along a nice-looking wallet with a small amount of cash in it and stash the rest in a crappy wallet elsewhere, so that they see that you don’t have much cash and it looks like you’re handing over everything you have when they solicit the bribe. I would choose driving over the chapas, which is your other option other than flying. Not sure about equipment rental but there’s only two dive shops and they’re both good. Gorgeous photos of a place that’s not yet spoiled by hordes of tourists!  Totally makes me want to go there! Ooohh this looks so amazing! I’m planning my Africa trip and definitely want to add it to the list! We’ll be there in May, do you reckon the weather might still be decent for beach lounging at that time? Thanks for the inspiration, I’m def stalking all your Africa posts right now 🙂 Tough to say but I’m sure it’s beautiful any time of year. It was unseasonably dry and cool when I was there, which was nice for me but not so much for the local farmers. “Eventually I come to really enjoy the daily interactions with this kid who swears he’s 18 but looks 16, and I respect the hustle. In another part of the world he’d be an insurance salesman and he’d be damn good at it.”  This bit caught me off guard in a good way.  Thank you for this it – has reminded me to constantly challenge how I look at the world. Definitely something I have to strive to do as well. Oooh, I am so glad I found your posts.  I will be in South Africa middle May and head over Mozambique right away. We will rent a car, stop to Tofo, Vilankulos and Maputo on our way back to Johannesburg.I read so many negative stuff about this country that I almost felt disappointed with my decision to visit it. But now, reading your posts I almost feel excited to go and can’t wait for the time to pass by. Awesome! Definitely check this one out about traveling there by car. There will be some police stops but it’s just part of it! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mozambique-travel-blog/ Gorgeous pics!!! What paradise. Awesome! I will go in December – could you also recommend on beach bungalows or accommodation in Tofo?By the way, I know you obtained your visa way ahead but did you see people getting visa at the border on your way to Maputo? You can only get the visa at the border if your country does not have an embassy. The US does so I couldn’t get one there. It also just depends on who you get at the border. I’d suggest getting it ahead of time to avoid any issues. I stayed at Fatima’s and the location is great, bungalows are just OK 🙂 I was so excited reading about places like Tofo, especially after reading about how affordable it seemed. I quickly did a flight search since I’m in the middle of planning my next vacation and the flights are in the thousands!!! Why go on and on about how “cheap” it is to vacation there when it costs so much just to fly in?? And to state that tourism has gone down??? No wonder! Only rich people Can get there ? I took a bus, Diana. It cost me less than $10 to get there. Nobody I met there was “rich” and most of them got in the same way. When I flew out, it was only $175. I’m not sure what kind of flight search you’re using but it’s not THAT expensive to get there. Very brave girl! Beautiful but too remote. No such thing as too remote I’m here at the moment and I gonna leave tomorrow..your blog post made me pretty sad cz you’re  describing this paradise perfectly! Reminds me of every reason why I gonna miss this place 🙂 And every reason why I’d love to go back! Thanks for this! I’m going to SA in January, then heading to Tanzania for Kili in February. I’m an avid diver and love the big stuff, aka whale sharks ?. They’re definitely on my bucket list. Any suggestions?? I’m definitely on a budget and will be solo most of the time. Thanks so much! I love your blog and all of your photos yeah definitely check out Tofo!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-mozambique/,Why Going Alone to Mozambique Was the Best Decision Ever,Mozambique,"I walked along the beach after jumping off the boat from an amazing day of SCUBA diving in Tofo, Mozambique. The white sand squeaked under my feet and the waves rolled in lazily. I had just seen a whale shark under water and I was ecstatic. It had taken me several days of long bus journeys to get there, but I made it and it turned out to be more wonderful than I’d imagined. I wasn’t wearing any shoes, hadn’t even considered makeup in weeks, and was smiling from ear to ear on a sunny day at one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. It wasn’t long before I spotted my crew of friends farther down on the sand. I met them a week prior when, on my walk back to my guesthouse, I passed by a few friendly-looking faces in the hammocks and stopped to chat with them for a while. I didn’t realize it then, but they’d turn out to be one of the best, most solid crews I’ve ever met while traveling, if not the most amazing to date. I ended up spending the rest of my three weeks in Africa with them, practically joined at the hip. We were a crew of 20 and 30-somethings from different corners of the world; some from the US, and some from Australia, Switzerland, and Canada. Some were Peace Corps volunteers and the rest had arrived there thanks to word of mouth, just like I had. They’d been digging a giant hole in the sand for hours that day. It was the brain-child of Jonas, a 20-year old from Switzerland whose spirit animal is undeniably a meerkat. He could not let go of the idea of making this happen and had spoken about it for days. His master plan was to make a hole big enough to fit nine people, because that’s just what you do when you have a group of intelligent people together in paradise with a lot of time on their hands, isn’t it? He was so enthusiastic about it that everyone got on board because, why not? As soon as I arrived, they chided, “Kristin’s here!” which I have to tell you is one of the nicest things to hear when you rock up to a group of people. Feeling genuinely welcomed is right near the top of my list of favorite feelings in the world. The hole was ridiculously huge, and when it came time to bury them so that we could get some photos before sunset, everyone around helped, from the beach boys who had been selling us coconuts for the past two weeks to random passers by who decided to get involved. Who wouldn’t, right? It was too bizarre and wonderful to walk away from. I volunteered to be the photographer since I love that role and don’t do well with tight, confined spaces. It was a good choice. Because we decided that if you want your garden to grow… You have to water it, right? Later that night, showered and happy in the warmth of the night, we sat in a circle waiting on our food. It hadn’t arrived yet because in Mozambique it takes at least two hours from ordering to eating. That’s when you just shrug and say, “T.I.A” (this is Africa), and learn the meaning of patience. We decided that the true spirit of Thanksgiving, as it was November 26, that with or without a feast we ought to share what we were most grateful and thankful for. When it got to Caspar, an incredibly well-spoken, tall, brown-haired and green-eyed Aussie who has been studying, working, and living in Mozambique for the past two years, he said something that brought tears to my eyes: The more he has traveled the world, the more he has come to fully believe that people are fundamentally good. He expressed that every single time that things started to look hopeless, someone would come along and change everything. He referenced times he had to hitchhike on the side of the road, got lost, or just openly appealed for help and when he needed it, and it always found him. The amount of kindness that people have shown him over and over, every single time he has had no choice but to rely on it, has reaffirmed this belief. His words resonated because I’ve long felt the very same thing. Every time I thought things were hopeless; when I was lost and someone showed me the way, when I stood on the side of the road hoping for a ride, or I lost my debit card and someone bailed me out, I was also shown that people are fundamentally good. Nothing has ever been so catastrophic that it couldn’t be redeemed by a random act of kindness. The majority of the time, it was someone who had less than I do, or was a perfect stranger, who gave the most. I often wondered, and was even told by others, that I was naive and idealistic for feeling this way, and that those things don’t just happen to everyone. To hear him say the very same thing that I felt down to my core finally affirmed what I know to be true: The world and the people in it are more kind, giving, and similar to each other than unkind, greedy, and different to each other. Even without speaking the same language, we can find a common ground. It also confirmed that what you put out there is what you get back. He and I are both open and giving but also understanding and not afraid to ask for help. People will give when they feel that kind of loving and receptive spirit, and when people ask me for help, I pay it forward. I felt so lucky in that moment to be surrounded by such positivity. It’s one of those things you optimistically hope for but know better than to expect when you travel. It’s a rarity to find such wonderful people to share your time with and the kind of thing that can only happen when all of the right situations come to pass that allow you to meet the people who create that spark. I owe these moments to traveling solo and being open to serendipity. It brings along the spirit that travel has always carried for me: It’s an unexpected adventure with people you have only just met but who you could be you friends for life. Every new encounter has the potential to change your trajectory and you simply never know what or who in the world might come your way next. That’s the spice of life, isn’t it? I can’t help but think that if I’d gone ahead with the original Mozambique plan with J, I wouldn’t have ever met this crew. I might not have ended up at Tofo at the same time, might not have walked up and met them that day, and probably wouldn’t have had any attention to give to anyone else. So thank you, J. In the end, everything came into being just the way it was meant to, and I’m glad that you found love. I did, too. Sounds like a blast! Would love to get to Mozambique one day. Really was so much fun! This was just beautiful. Incredibly inspiring words here. Thank you <3 This is a great example of how solo travel rewards you with unique experiences! I remember reading on your Instagram that you were heading to Mozambique by yourself, and thinking you were really brave. I’m a solo traveler myself, but Africa has always been the one continent I wouldn’t go to alone. I’m glad to see how well it went for you! I actually went to South Africa solo first which is more dangerous, at least statistically. I love both countries and all of the surroundings and even solo, you don’t have to fear Africa. It’s a wonderful place full of wonderful people. It’s just a little more ‘advanced’ if you will as far as difficulties and things you have to be aware of 🙂 Kristin, I usually read your articles when they come in my inbox and think things like, “damn I wish I was in Iceland right now!.” But today I had to click through and comment because this is EXACTLY how I felt traveling solo and exactly what no one else ever really seems to understand when my mom worried for my safety or friends questioned my choices to go it alone. When all my money was stolen and other backpackers paid for my way from Thailand to Cambodia, when a stranger paid my border fees in Costa Rica because my debit card got eaten and I would have been kicked off the bus. People ARE good and my absolute favorite part of traveling solo is finding these crews of soul mate friends you didn’t even know you had. I’m married now so traveling solo long term will probably never happen again for me, but I would honestly hope that the hubby and I are fortunate to meet another great crew. I’ve met three such ragtag groups around the world in my whole life and I am still friends with every one of them. Absolutely love this and damnnit I want to go to Mozambique! Thanks for reading and for commenting, Taylor 🙂I’ve had locals help me out of sticky situations, too, and what people who haven’t traveled alone don’t have the chance to experience is the kind of generosity that comes along when you really are alone and close to hitting rock bottom and you wonder what in the world you’re even doing. Then someone realizes you’re alone, you need help, and they give it to you. It’s such a wonderful thing and it has happened for me at the 11th hour many times. So glad you’ve experienced the same! I’ve been waiting for your Africa posts! It really resonated with me when you wrote about your plans falling through and then deciding to forge on anyway. I’ve been reflecting lately on how many adventures I would have missed out on if I had relied on other people. I too have had travel companions drop out at the last minute and as upset as that sometimes made me, I still went on and had some of the best adventures of my life. Most recently was in Portugal where I dined with locals, had a brief romance, went canyoning for the first time, and indulged at an expense resort in Pinhao up in the Douro Valley. Had my friend not have dropped out of the trip 3 weeks before, I wouldn’t have been able to do any of that as she had wanted to stick to the touristy beaches down South – the beaches which I wound up completely ignoring as I was just having too much fun up North. I guess what I’m trying to say is “I feel ya gurllll.” Haha, awesome! It’s so true that going alone lets you just do whatever the heck you want. It’s something I really value and that kind of freedom is beautiful. I hope more people just try it, even just once, because you can have such a real, rich adventure that way. This is one of my favorite articles of yours ever! I totally agree with everything you said about solo travel, and I really hope to be able to experience that in Mozambique one day. It sounds like everything was set up just the way you needed it to, even if it didn’t seem like that at first when your travel partner backed out 🙂 Most definitely. I feel so lucky that it all worked out positively and I started to wonder if it was just a fluke, but when Caspar said what he said I realized it’s not. When you bravely put yourself out there it tends to work out. So glad you liked this post! <3 What a great read, totally feel the same way. Viva solo travels! ” It’s an unexpected adventure with people you have only just met but who you could be you friends for life.”So true….. I’m so grateful for the amazing best friends I have in my life right now who I met on my last trip… that alone wants me to carry on travelling forever as I cannot imagine life without them now. Totally feel the same. Some of the people I’m best friends with now I met because I was traveling and I can’t imagine life without them! I can’t imagine life without the experiences I’ve had, either. It’s pretty crazy, isn’t it? So glad you had such an amazing time!  I followed your trip on snapchat and did feel a little bad that you were so nervous before leaving!  But it looks like it turned out great for you.  You are right, you should live your life for yourself and not wait for J or any other person to determine where/when you are going to go!  Delighted you had such a good time! Aw didn’t mean to make anyone feel bad! I’m pretty open on Snapchat though. Sometimes if I’m really alone it’s nice because it feels like there is still someone there with me, sharing it with me and it’s nice when people send little messages through 🙂 Thanks for the love! <3 this is so fun! how brave of you to travel alone and how fun that you met such a cool group of other travelers! I generally. travel with my boyfriend and while we always find fun people to chat with we have yet to encounter such a group like this! Hope you enjoy the rest of your travels <3 It’s a bit tougher as a couple I think, simply because people aren’t usually as likely to approach a couple as a solo traveler. I have found that when I’m with a guy friend, even if we’re not dating, people think we are and get approached less by others. It’s too bad but I guess as a solo traveler I typically don’t approach couples, either. This was wonderful! I had a somewhat similar experience in Africa as well! I had been meeting a lot of people while I was in Europe who had just traveled in Morocco and takes about how much they loved it. I wanted to go too, but was nervous about going alone. Then I remembered that getting out of my comfort zone was the reason I started traveling in the first place. So I booked the ticket. It was an incredible 3 weeks and I met some AMAZING people, both locals and travelers alike. It reminded me why I loved to travel. Just what I needed at the time 🙂 Yay! I have to remind myself of the same every time I go somewhere new by myself. I’m always nervous and in the end I’m always happy I did it. I really want to visit Mozambique, where do I start?  Any travel agencies you recommend, or is it better to plan everything out yourself?  Thanks !  This would be my first time visiting that continent so I have no experience.. I didn’t go with a tour agency I just winged it and I tend to prefer that method. There’s more on that here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/mozambique-travel-blog/ Beautiful, beautiful story, Kristin. I totally agree with what’s being said here – that people are fundamentally good. It’s a wonderful thing to realise. Plus now I really want to go to Mozambique! I bet you’d love it, Brenna! It has all the wonderful characteristics about Africa that I love – beautiful, lovely people, and great food! Wow, beautiful! Nothing like serendipitously finding your tribe. It also makes me feel good to read this as I’m a bit sick of being called naive for believing in the power of empathy and positive energy. Though those who travel a lot (and cheaply) usually agree.  Mozambique looks gorgeous! I’ll have to make it there some day for sure. That’s wonderful! Let us know how it goes for you! I LOVE that part of the world so much What an amazing post and I couldn’t agree with you more! “The more he has traveled the world, the more he has come to fully believe that people are fundamentally good.” …When I read those words, my inner response was, “Yes! Finally someone who gets it!”. Just like others have said before me, I’m also a little bit sick of being called naive and idealistic, but I’ve also come to realise that the people I get those criticisms from, are the people who don’t bother to step out into the world and be open themselves. And I get it. It takes trust, and to trust takes courage, and a lot of people are afraid of getting hurt… but I’ve noticed that if you’re open and have peaceful intentions, people will recognise that and will reciprocate with their openness and peaceful intentions. Really great post! 🙂 Totally! That’s how I felt, too. You get out of life and your encounters with people what you give to them, at least that’s what I’ve found. Being happy, approachable, and open are all required to get the same in return. People are lovely all over the world and I firmly believe that! What a small world! Drew’s a cool dude. Had the pleasure of hanging a bit in Tofo and Vilanculos while he was on school holidays. So much fun. Planning to be there coming month anyway. I hope it will be more exciting as yours. I have been looking for a clue and how to go about it. Thanks for sharing your experience.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/is-maputo-dangerous/,Maputo is Not as Bad as They Say,Mozambique,"Remember at the beginning of November when I was about to board a plane and go to Mozambique in Southern Africa by myself? Remember how, fewer than two weeks before I was set to depart, the person I was meant to meet up with for the trip cancelled on me? Another girl had floated into his life and he followed his heart – which meant he stayed in South Africa with her and told me he had to cancel our plans. Though disappointed, I wasn’t angry with him but I was scared of what lay ahead of me. I worried about what a place like Mozambique would hold considering I couldn’t find any information at all online about traveling there as a solo female, except for some terrible advice on a SCUBA message board that made my blood boil:     I couldn’t believe that everyone was trying to talk her out of going to Mozambique alone. I mean first of all, Zimbabwe isn’t Mozambique and second of all, it hasn’t been ‘Rhodesia’ since Jimmy Carter was in office. That was all that I found on the topic of solo female travel in Mozambique, apart from an account of a woman who was robbed there, so a little fearful of what laid ahead of me, I packed up and went because I wasn’t about to let a guy end my trip before it even started. I know how to stay safe when I travel, right? I decided I’d handle things in the way that I did when I first started traveling, and that I wanted to get back to the soul of being on the road – I’d couchsurf with locals during my short time in South Africa, and that way, I’d be able to get some local suggestions for Mozambique before I took off. I found a host who had a house in Johannesburg full of PhD and medical students who were all about to graduate. He said I was welcome to stay as long as I liked and once I landed and made my way there, they welcomed me immediately and invited me up to one of the lookout points in the city for the sunset. It all came full circle as I had done the very same thing on my first day in South Africa back in January, with a sunset from a peaceful vantage point, my body hardly able to comprehend where it was. Later that night we had an impromptu rain dance (there’s a drought in South Africa at the moment). The whole house got into it. I’m still not clear on how much it was in earnest and how much was just silly and playing around but I loved the fact that we were all dancing together, laughing, burning incense and making up moves to an 8-minute rain dance song on YouTube. It reminded me why, from the beginning, I’d principally sought travel like this – new in a room where nobody knew me, a chance to learn so much about the local culture, an opportunity to come into something existing and lasting as a guest and to reap the energy and carry a bit of it away with me. Over the next couple of days I obtained a Mozambican visa, bought a bus ticket, had a couple of BBQs and a pool day with my couchsurfing host, then left on an early morning 10-hour bus bound for Maputo – the capital of Mozambique. I’d heard nothing but horror stories about the city and the border crossing. The police were rumored to be corrupt and everyone told me not to go out at night and to get out of the city as quickly as possible. I’d also been told that it was likely I’d have to pay bribes at the border, so when I arrived, I was ready for a challenge. I felt a bit like a video game character advancing a level with each officer who reached out his hand for my passport and asked questions, wondering if he’d be the one to ask for money. “You’re from California! The sunshine state.”“Nah that’s Florida, California is the golden state, sir,” I replied, making eye contact the entire time, my back completely straight. He let me pass. Next up, an officer with a man polishing his shoes gave me a sly smile and flipped through the pages of my fat and fraying passport, the person just ahead of me had a crumpled up rand note ready to go. I was too focused to see if he had to hand it over or not. “America. Obama! I want to go there!” the officer said, handing my passport back. Another one passed. Finally, the last officer with a giant scar near his eye took my passport just as I was about to slink by, unnoticed. “America! Chicago!” He said. “No, Los Angeles,” I replied to no recognition on his face. “California?” I ventured. Still nothing. “I only know Hollywood,” he replied, sheepish. “Yes, California,” I smiled. I could tell he wasn’t used to being corrected, and he’d gone from appearing the most eager and likely to ask for a bribe to just wanting me to walk away, then handed my passport back over and wished me a good time in Mozambique. Most of the land crossings I’ve experienced in Africa are the same: hot, incredibly dusty and dirty, and crawling with hawkers trying to sell everything from SIM cards to a horrible exchange rate for some US dollars. Cars, trucks and buses funnel through as the foot traffic weaves to the sides and through the middle, forming a line for a stamp into the next place. A new horizon, a fresh adventure. I boarded the bus again and sat myself next to a Portuguese woman. She was petite, wearing dark jeans in the insane summer heat, and stared pensively out the window in between nodding off to sleep and reading. Her dark curly hair grazed her large, black-framed glasses and I figured she be an artist (which was true). We started talking and I expressed to her that I was worried about Maputo, and she wrinkled her brows and said, “give it a chance, and I think you’ll find that there’s a soul to it.” I stepped off the bus after the better part of 10 hours, which weren’t all that bad for some reason (my ability to sleep anywhere, any time, perhaps?) to a taxi driver greeting me promising that he was from my hostel, Fatima’s. I was skeptical but what options did I have? So I went along. He tried to charge me nearly $8 for the ride, which for only 2km I knew was way too expensive. He gave me the upper hand when he took my bag out of the trunk and handed it over before I paid, so I asked him to kindly wait a moment while I grabbed the hostel manager who talked him down to the standard rate of $4. My years of traveling have served me well. After checking into the hostel, sweaty and tired, a tall, dark-haired Brazilian man previously sitting at his computer with headphones on came over and handed me a coffee. “You look like you could use this,” he said with a smile. Later that night he and a local hostel employee invited my dorm mate, a tall, blonde, 18-year old English girl named Ella who had just started her solo travels, and in Mozambique of all places, and me out to an art gallery party (Nucleo de Arte, if you’re interested). Remembering what the Portuguese woman had told me, I accepted and so did Ella. What unfolded was easily one of the best dance parties I’ve ever been to. Contrary to what I’d heard about Maputo, everyone there was dressed nicely, spoke English well, and appeared far more polished than I was in my comfy shorts and loose shirt. The art was impressive, and so was the music. The sound system was shockingly good and the locals tended to form circles, each doing a dance that she or he had clearly perfected for years – it was each person’s individual move and the competition was fierce. The Afro-house music blasted until after midnight and I tried to forget about my 4am bus departure the next morning. In the midst of the good energy and beats, that’s when you find a dance move you never had in you before, and an appreciation for something you never realized you’d always yearned for. It nestles it self right into your heart where it will probably prod you forever – this night, this place, this feeling. I realized that night that I was happy to be on the trip alone, as I’d opened myself up to serendipity. That’s the thing about solo travel, because otherwise the most important person in the room is missing: The real you. It’s the person you are when nobody you know is around to influence you. I always say traveling doesn’t change you but rather allows you to truly be who you’ve always been. On that warm night with muddy feet and a smile from ear to ear, I was me again. Ahh I want to go to Mozambique now! Actually I’ve been fascinated by Mozambique for quite awhile, but this makes me want to go more! I can’t imagine I’ll make it there in the next couple years but I’m excited for when I do. Personally I think in “dangerous” locations solo travel is almost the best idea, because you can focus all your attention on yourself. Actual dangerous places are another thing, but places like most of Africa, the Middle East, South America etc. solo travel would be more rewarding I think it’s hard to say an entire country is ‘dangerous’ because if I think about the US, there are places where you have to lock the door when you’re at home and some where you never lock your door and know all your neighbors. It’s just about behaving, as tourists, how we would in a big city back home. Would I walk around alone at night? No. Would I have my phone out all the time in less than savory neighborhoods? No.  You’re right, solo travel is super rewarding. Yay, awesome story. Well told, reminds me of Johnny Wards trip across to Libya he posted earlier. Border crossings can be interesting but aren’t thaaaaat bad 🙂 They result in a good story! It’s always great to read about someone debunking the rumors about “dangerous” places. Sure, they can be dangerous, but really not much more than a big city in the United States. It’s all about perception and using common sense. Good read! Can’t wait for more! That’s the thing. Big cities in the US can be just as bad or worse. To be fair, Maputo can actually be quite dangerous.While we were there with my boyfriend, we stayed with a mozambican family for a week while waiting for my luggage that had been lost in transit. First day there, we went for a walk around the city “center” (which is not at all in the center but by the water, but that’s not the point). We got out of a mall, my boyfriend asked for directions to go back to our hosts’ place taking a different path than the one we used (he is portugese so langage was not an issue). We followed the directions, got to the sports center / pool and saw that our host’s house was just on top of the hill about 200 meters away and there was a path going there. We started walking and about 20 meters down the paths, we hear people yelling and see young people running towards us, waving their arms. Turns out, the path we were taking is notorious for being dangerous in Maputo (even though nothing else around is dangerous), and the teenagers who told us so elaborated by saying my boyfriend would have been beaten up and robbed, and I’d have been raped (apparently, that had happened before, it was confirmed by our hosts).Sooooo, sure nothing happened to us so all’s good, and we really enjoyed the month we spent in Mozambique (especially Tofo, where we stayed with another mozambican family), but with a little less luck it easily could have (like if my boyfriend hadn’t understood what the teenagers were saying).And the family we stayed with clearly felt Maputo was dangerous, even compared to other big cities they’d been to, and even for them.. For sure it can. I don’t mean to say it’s not and that people shouldn’t be cautious when they’re there. I just was led to believe that there were no redeeming qualities and I felt like I found a gem by attending that party and, like Johannesburg which people also try to avoid because of its reputation, there are cultural and artistic parts of both cities that make them amazing. It’s too bad that their reputation outshines the good things the produce. I found that Joburg had WAY more soul than Cape Town, for example. Not that we’re talking about SA here, but I find that most people who go to one go to the other and it’s my best example for comparison 🙂 Very cool story. You are very courageous indeed. I’m not too much of a fan of traveling into “dangerous places” even though I know every city or country has its more shady parts and nicer parts. As long as you know where those places are and don’t wander into them you’d be fine. Thanks for helping shed a brighter light on a place that few would even consider going to. Trouble is, I basically had no choice but to route through Maputo and spend the night there given my transport method. You can skip it and fly directly to Tofo but I wanted to go overland to show that it’s doable and I’m so glad that I did! Kristin I loved this post! We should always be open to new experiences and give things a go. I’m so happy that you’re happy ❤️ Love you Chelsea! Love your blog too! Awesome!! So glad it all worked out – and what fun! Hi Kristin I am a South African who visited Maputo last year October for the first time.  I fully agree with your friend that Maputo has a soul. Hidden gems of beautiful colonial buildings in Baixa, excellent food everywhere, very art- and music-minded people. The train station is a truly magical place – it great condition and a absolute must see. Great nightlife. Although dirty the city is functional. But what I enjoyed most is that Maputo does not have the feeling that you get elsewhere in Africa that the colonial past is at odds with the African culture.  In Maputo the Portuguese influence is very much part of the local African identity and people embrace that. It is therefore much more like Latin American than any other city in Africa with a colonial past.  Most skilled people I met have strong connections to both Portugal and Brazil.  I enjoyed my trip tremendously apart from been harassed by police twice for taking photos.  The most negative part of Maputo most certainly is the police – most corrupt I have found on the African continent and one cannot be too careful.  A tip is to walk around with little cash and a copy of your passport certified IN Mozambique.  Leave your passport in your hotel safe.  I tried to avoid them, but it wasn’t always successful. But that did not take away the pleasure of being in Maputo and I will go back.  Another gorgeously beautiful part of Mozambique is Namaacha.  It is truly one of the most special places in Africa I have been too.  Ornately beautiful down in stunning sorrounding perched on a hill overlooking Swaziland.  Enjoy your solo travels – am going to Greece next. I agree that the police in Mozambique in particular are pretty awful to deal with. I love the way you describe the culture! Thanks for the tip on a new place to go as well. I’d love to return to Moz soon. I’ve read ALL of your accounts on your trip to Mozambique. I’m very impressed with the way in which you handled it all. ‘J’ really deserves to be debollocked! What a fool. Anyway, youve inspired me. I’m going to be traveling around the globe alone later on this year. Leaving London then going to Dubai, Kenya, South Africa, Mozambique, the Maldives, Mumbai, New Dheli, Hong Kong, Malasia, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, South America, Los Angeles, New York and back to good old Blighty. Thank you so very much.  Tim. Lol, I’m glad you liked what you read and found it helpful! Everything works out in the end. J actually came back and apologized this summer. I never expected that and didn’t have hard feelings but better late than never! What a great, personal story and makes this site unique. This is one of your best writings too, I felt like I was reading an excerpt from a great novel, but it was all real! Way to show how solo female travelers shouldn’t shy away from these places. Glad J apologized but in the end it seems like it was fate as you got back to your solo roots, and reminded yourself and all of us of how magical it can be, plus in a country and city that has more to offer than many give credit for.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/namibia-road-trip-itinerary/,The Perfect Namibia Road Trip Itinerary,Namibia,"Southern Africa’s desert country is the perfect mixture of adventurous, beautiful, accessible, and attainable. Often, overland traveling in Africa can mean terrible roads, difficult conditions, and unique challenges, however road trips in Namibia are usually just a bit easier, which makes it the perfect destination to self drive in Africa. Namibia is a politically stable country, it’s fairly easy to navigate, has great infrastructure, and a lot of variety. Ready for this warm, beautiful adventure? Here are some top stops to put on your Namibian road trip itinerary, beginning from north to south: What kind of adventure do you want to have? Do you want to head off the beaten path where you’ll need a 4×4, or mostly stick to paved roads? In general, most rentals are 4x4s equipped with rooftop tents and the ability to take you off road if needed. In Etosha National Park and down south towards Sossusvlei, expect washboard and gravel roads. At times, rains can create rivers within the roads as well, which are much easier to handle in a 4×4. If you plan on heading up north, which you’ll see in the next section, a 4×4 is essential. You can compare prices and book here. Nestled in the north of the country, this arid region is located between the famous skeleton coast and Etosha National Park. Most of it is only accessible with a 4 x 4 or via flight. However, if you truly want to get off the beaten path in Namibia and see the Himba people, famous in Namibia for their regalia and red body painting, this is the place.  Located on the Kunene River just south of the Angolan border, Epupa Falls is made up of a series of cascades that drop for about 60m.The scenery is breathtaking and a refreshing change from the constant desert views – you will see the Baynes Mountains in the background, and palms and trees (Fig, Makalani, and baobabs to name a few) balancing on the rocks above. Epupa Falls are best visited right after the rainy season, when the spray is at its peak, though the falls are great during the dry season as well. The best things to do in the area include a sundowner walk to the top of the hills to see the spectacular sunset, rafting, when there’s enough water, and visiting the living museum of the Ovahimba tribe to gain a better understanding of the local culture. Activities are typically best booked through your accommodation. Stay: Epupa Camp  The Skeleton Coast is wildly beautiful but dangerous (hence, the name). This treacherous coast stretches across a foggy region with rusting shipwrecks, dunes and sandy coastal shallows. The early Portuguese sailors named it As Areias do Inferno – The Coast of Death / The Sands of Hell – the destructive power of Mother Nature is on full display here, with shipwrecks, bleached whale bones, and perished ship crews’ fate all along the sand. Traveling in Skeleton Coast is challenging. Distances are vast, amenities pretty much do not exist, and the roads are demanding. You will need a 4×4 for this. This is not to say that you should avoid Skeleton Coast when in Namibia – quite the contrary, actually! Visit the National West Coast Tourist Recreation Area in the south (permit required and can be purchased directly at the gate), and Skeleton Coast National Park up north (accessible by fly-in safari only). Pack well, drive along the coast and stop wherever you fancy. Explore the wild beachfront in Henties Bay, which is the only real town on Skeleton Coast. From there, drive 40 miles north to witness the largest breeding colony of Cape fur seals in the world at Cape Cross Seal Reserve. For a cultural experience, you can arrange a tour to see the Himba villages. Finally, you’ll definitely want to see the Dunedin Star and the Eduard Bohlen shipwrecks. For your own safety, don’t go too fast on the gravel roads (suggest the limit to be 50 mph/80kph), and prevent irreversible harm to the local ecology (such as lichen or salt pans) by staying on the road at all times. Stay: Shipwreck Lodge or Hoanib Skeleton Coast Camp The Kalahari Desert is a semi arid sandy savannah extending over 900,000 km². If you drive into Namibia through Botswana, or are planning on heading out that way, chances are you will be driving through the Kalahari Desert. It can be incredibly hot during the summer months, reaching over 40°C/104°F. That said, it’s worth stopping in the desert to break up your long driving day – there’s lots to see! This is a great spot for stargazing, and to learn about the hunter-gatherer group, the San people. Though their way of life is sadly dying out, some locals still do offer walking tours where they teach you the ways that they live off the land. Stay: Kalahari Bush Breaks (the lodge is lovely but it’s not the best for camping)  Etosha National Park is the spot in Namibia for wildlife sightings. The park spans an area of over 22,000 km², though the Etosha pan covers 21% of it. During the dry season, the pan looks like an endless, white expanse and in the rainy season it can sometimes partially fill up with water. The park is home to hundreds of species of animals and is a great place to see the severely endangered Black and White rhinos. I’ve also seen honey badgers, lions, elephants, and of course the usual suspects, zebra, giraffes, springbok, impala, and ostriches. It’s possible to self drive in Etosha and if you choose to go this route, simply look for the places where other cars are pulled over and you’re sure to see some wildlife too!  It’s possible to stay in the park as well as outside of the park. If you stay within the park, your options are mostly camping with meager reviews, though outside the park you can find luxury and mid-range lodge options. I particularly liked Ongum and Gondwana, linked below. You can also choose to stay on one end, spend the day driving through, and end up on the other side. For the best animal sightings, head to the watering holes, particularly during the dry season. Stay: Gondwana Etosha Safari Lodge or within the park Spitzkoppe in Damaraland is another great stop for those who are in search of a tranquil experience that’s slightly off the typical road trip routes. Nicknamed as the “Matterhorn of Africa”, the Spitzkoppe is a group of bald granite peaks that sprout up from the Namib Desert floor between Usakos and Swakopmund. Spitzkoppe means “pointed dome” – the highest outcrop rises about 5800 feet above sea level, which stands out dramatically from the flat surrounding plains. One of the area’s biggest claims to fame is the cave paintings which date back thousands of years, depicting animals in the area and used as a communication method for other nomads back in the day. In order to see these, you’ll need to hire a local guide, which you can do at the entrance. Be sure to check out the rock arch, and if you can, catch the sunrise and sunset – it’s beautiful out there. Stay: Okambishi’s Rest or basic, off the grid camping within Spitzkoppe  The desert elephants that can be found in the Kunene region are currently of high national and international conservation priority. While they are not a separate species, the desert elephants have adapted to the desert environment by shrinking their body mass with longer legs and larger feet, allowing them to walk across the sand and travel further in order to reach water sources. They also obtain hydration by eating moist vegetation, and can go for days without drinking water. Indeed, animals are fascinating. To see the desert elephants, you can check with lodges in the area that offer morning game drives. You can combine visiting this with the Spitzkoppe, as they are both in Damaraland. Stay: Grootberg Lodge  Located in the middle of the country on the coast, Walvis Bay is pretty in pink. This is where you can see the famous flamingos of Namibia as well as pink salt lakes.  Take a Kayaking and Sandwich Harbor tour for a ride around the dunes on the coast, or better yet, combine it with kayaking to get closer to the flamingos, seals, and potential dolphin sightings, and watch the sunset over the flamingos grazing on the seashore. Just a 30 minute drive north, you’ll find Swakopmund, Namibia’s sandy adventure capital. This is the perfect place to go quad biking, sand boarding, and even skydiving. You can read more about my experience with each here. If you’ve been aching for some semi fast Internet and infrastructure after exploring the remote parts of Namibia, spend a few days in Swakopmund to recharge and go grocery shopping before heading out on another adventure. Stay: Hotel Eberwein in Swakopmund The capital and the largest city in Namibia is most likely where you enter the country if you’re flying in from an international destination. This is the perfect place to get your car rental, grocery shop if you plan on staying in campsites in making use of their, or your own, kitchens, and gear up for your adventure. While there are some museums and strong Internet connections, for the most part I just use it as a transit stop because the most interesting parts of Namibia are outside of the city. Stay: Windhoek Gardens Probably the most famous stop in Namibia apart from Etosha, Sossusvlei and Deadvlei are where you will find the tallest sand dunes in the world and those famous skeletons of acacia trees. Give yourself at least one full day to explore this sandy wonderland, beginning early in the morning, around sunrise if you can, to climb the famous Dune 45. Next, tackle Big Daddy, a 45-minute climb up a 1000-foot dune, and run and slide down the side as you descend into Deadvlei. This is one of the iconic experiences in Namibia and after two visits back, remains my highlight each time. Be sure to maximize the morning hours as it gets unbearably hot in the afternoon. For more advice on where to stay as well as maps, take a look at my Sossusvlei guide. Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park is small but mighty. The park offers plentiful animal sighting opportunities, including black eagles, hyrax, baboons, and of course, zebras. It isn’t on most Namibian road trip routes so it’s quieter than other stops, and there’s no cell service so it’s quite perfect if you want a tranquil experience. Most people spend 1-2 nights and wish they stayed longer. There are various hiking trails, such as the Waterkloof Trail and Olive Trail, both of which can be completed in 7-8 hours, though Olive Trail can be turned into a hike that takes 8 days to finish. It is a bit out of the way (see map below), and there’s no electricity nor shops to stock things up so expect camping to be basic. Stay: Naukluft Campsite  Kolmanskop, located in Luderitz, was once a rich town back in 1908, when diamonds were discovered in the area. Apparently, the diamonds were so plentiful one did not even have to dig to get a handful. 20 years after, a combination of WWI and discovery of another area with even more diamonds resulted in a collective migration, turning Kolmanskop into a ghost town that’s gradually been swallowed by the desert sand, literally. The buildings are intriguing, and the entire area is a photographer’s dream – the way the sand and sunlight interact and create different light and shadows is hauntingly beautiful. A tour is recommended as you will gain a better understanding and interesting facts of the area. Kolmanskop is open from 8AM – 1PM daily. The area is actually pretty big so more often than not, you are likely to be the only people in sight. This just adds to the eerie atmosphere. Book your stay at Luderitz here  If you want to see one of Africa’s remaining herds of wild horses, check out the wild horses of Aus. In recent years of drought, some of the horses have not been able to survive. However, the rain that broke the drought earlier this year has brought a sign of hope to the 79 surviving horses. There’s something so humbling about watching the wild horses in their element, and also observing how we all rely on Mother Nature for survival, one way or another. There’s a shelter set up close to the watering hole where you can view the wild horses. If you self drive, travel along the B4 from Aus to Luderitz and you should be able to spot some. Just be sure to keep a safe distance (to not frighten them), and do not feed them! Keep in mind that there’s a possibility of seeing very little or even none of them. As with all wild animal sightings, it comes down to luck. Stay: Klein-Aus Vista Desert Horse Inn  The 500 million-year-old canyon is one of the world’s largest natural canyons, just behind the Grand Canyon in Arizona, stretching over 99 miles. Depending on your preference, the Fish River Canyon can be a relatively relaxing day trip, or a challenging 4-day hike. From Sossusvlei, drive towards Hobas, the main entry point, and make your way to Hell’s Corner (marked in the map below). The viewpoint gives you a 360 degree view of the massive canyon. You should also explore the area and stay for the incredible sunset. For those who are up for a challenge, you’ve got some prep work to do! Get your new medical certificate, book your hike in advance (it is compulsory, and only 30 people per day are allowed into the canyon for hiking). The hiking trails are only open from May 1 to September 15. Do note that a minimum of 3 people are required to book the hike, so if you are a solo traveler, join a guided hike instead. As mentioned, the hike takes about 4-5 days, and it is no easy task so make sure you have a decent level of fitness and can carry water with you. Hiking in the extreme heat requires serious precautions. Here are some tips to remember: Stay: Hobas camp site  To me, Namibia is the most unique experience in southern Africa. Surrounded by countries with greenery, lots of people, and mostly Safari options, Namibia has a bit more to offer in terms of coast, sand dunes, and adventure activities. It’s also one of the easier and safer countries to travel through in Africa, so if you’re considering it, put Namibia on your list! It’s a true African adventure, and this road trip itinerary can take you to the best of it. *Some links in this post are affiliate links to companies we use or hotels we have stayed at.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sossusvlei-guide-namib-naukluft/,A Guide to Namibia’s Gorgeous Sossusvlei,Namibia,"Sossus means “place of no return”. Looking out at those gorgeous endless dunes with the bright blue sky and the vast expanses in every direction, it is easy to see why. Once you see this for yourself you’ll never be the same. Namib-Naukluft National Park is one of the most popular attractions in Namibia, with the highest sand dunes in the world, the photogenic Deadvlei full of tree skeletons, and a massive salt pan known as Sossusvlei . In many ways it seems like it’s not even Earth anymore. Located in Namibia’s largest protected area, Sossusvlei is a must-see, although it’s easier to enjoy if you have some key info. Here’s everything you need to know about visiting Sossusvlei: Sossusvlei is a salt and clay pan that was created by the Tsauchab River that flows through the Sesriem Canyon every 5-10 years. The river does not reach the Atlantic Ocean even during the wet years, but drains away between the dunes. The famous scorched acacia trees in Deadvlei had the chance to grow when the river previously flowed through the area, however, due to a drought, all of the trees died. Since there was not enough moisture for the dead trees to decompose, they remain perfectly preserved, standing for over 900 years now, and possibly for centuries to come. What is there to see? So much, my friends! Dunes: Deadvlei: In order to make it to Deadvlei, you’ll want a 4 x 4 vehicle to get through the sand. Most people who visit ride in one of the park’s vehicles which run regularly from the end of the paved road and take you right up to Big Daddy and Deadvlei. The hike up Big Daddy takes roughly 45 minutes, and you’ll want to leave an equal amount of time to wander around the trees at Deadvlei as well. Wildlife: Although the desert conditions are harsh, there is a delicate ecosystem with a surprising amount of life living around and underneath the dunes. You may find snakes, geckos, hyenas, scorpions, hoofed Kudu and Oryx, and interesting insects. So be mindful when exploring or driving in the area. Sunrise: If you possibly can stay in the park, do so because it’s the only way to see the sunrise from within the park boundaries. Otherwise, you can queue up and head in just after the sun rises when the park gates open. Park entrance fees are 60 Namibian dollars per person. Unfortunately the options within the park are either a lodge that books up quickly and gets expensive during high season, or camping. There’s more info in the ‘where to stay’ section below so you can weigh your options. If you’re self driving, this is a helpful area map with suggested driving and hiking routes. After two trips to Namib-Naukluft National Park I’m convinced that the best footwear for climbing the dunes is none. I spent the entire time on both trips barefoot, finding that in the early morning the ground was not too hot yet and it just made it easier to get up and down the dunes. Shoes usually take on too much sand and will end up weighing you down, although if you are uncomfortable with the idea of going barefoot, socks are a good alternative. Also, remember the great rule of climbing dunes: Let someone else go first, and always walk directly in the footprints of the person who went before you. It is so much easier! Otherwise, bring clothing that you can climb dunes in – I usually opt for a short sleeved shirt and shorts – along with a hat, sunscreen, and enough water for the day. You’ll be able to buy it at the park entrance but not thereafter. The best time to enjoy the park is as early as possible in the morning. If you are staying within the park boundaries and you can get to Dune 45 for sunrise, get your fill there and then head immediately to Big Daddy to start climbing before it gets blistering hot. If you can’t get to Dune 45 for sunrise, don’t despair as the crowds thin out shortly thereafter and you can get it all to yourself if you wait a bit to hike up. That said, chances are good you will want to leave the park by midday because it simply gets too hot to enjoy by afternoon. You can always head back for golden hour to get smaller crowds and equally beautiful colors. If you want to stay in the park for sunrise, your only options are Sesriem Campsite and Sossus Dune Lodge. Sesriem Campsite is the only campsite available inside the park, right beside the gate. This is the only campsite that allows visitors to get in the park an hour before sunrise and an hour after sunset, when the inner gate opens and closes. Facilities and service are basic, though there is a pool which is great after a long day under the hot sun. If catching the sunrise and sunset, and being the first group of people there are your priorities while on a budget, definitely stay here. Be sure to book in advance! (The campsite will be increasing their prices from $15 per night to $24 per night in 2019. More information on the pricing here.) Sossus Dune Lodge is an eco-friendly, luxurious accommodation offering 25 chalets with direct views of the dunes, and 12 chalets with a view of the mountains and the Sesriem Canyon. Similar to Sesriem Campsite, the location of the lodge allows visitors to access the park before everyone else in the morning, and after everyone else in the evening. Expect to pay $140 – $300 per night. More information on the pricing here. Desert Camp is a quick 5 minute drive away from the park entrance and where I stayed with my BMTM Adventures group. The camp has amazing night sky views, standalone bungalows, a decent pool, a wooden bar, and great facilities. You can use their BBQ facilities, or travel 5km to the Sossusvlei Lodge for an amazing dinner, which is what we did. Expect to pay about $80 – $100 per night. Sossusvlei Lodge is just 1 minute from the gate so it’s really as good as it gets. The luxury lodge has amazing online reviews, with people suggesting to extend your stay, as you are likely to arrive late in the afternoon on the first day, leave early for sunrise on the next day and not come back until evening. Stay one more night so you can enjoy the amazing facilities and great food Sossusvlei Lodge has to offer. Expect to pay about $300 per night. Unfortunately, the roads heading to Sesriem are unpaved, gravel roads. Most people travel there via the capital, Windhoek, or Swakopmund. Be prepared for washboard roads and gravel for about 4-5 hours from either starting point. It is doable in a non-4 x 4 vehicle, though if you plan on heading off the beaten path in Namibia and self driving in Etosha, you may want one anyway. Make sure you’re equipped to change a tire just in case. Finally, don’t forget to look up at night. Namibia has some of the best star viewing on Earth and the Namib desert is dry enough to provide some crystal clear viewing, followed by a beautiful day running around the dunes. Enjoy it, this is one of the best experiences in Africa!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/africa-packing-list/,"An Easy, Fashionable Africa Packing List",Namibia,"“What in the world do people pack when they go to Africa? Where do I start? What is essential and what should I leave behind?” This was my question before I went to Africa for the first time, heading to South Africa with a backpack full of denim shorts and tank tops, kind of clueless about what was and wasn’t cool to wear there. It turned out that in most of Southern Africa, people dressed just like where I’m from in California – it’s all about fashion, feeling comfortable, and keeping it laid back. In Africa, you’ll see all kinds of interesting fashion decisions. I have to laugh to myself a little bit each time I travel there and see foreigners like me decked out head to toe in beige and olive green safari gear. They’ve got the vests, the hats, and the pants that zip off at the knee. Honestly, what do they think they’re going to need that for? You’re not even allowed to get out of the safari vehicles when in the wildlife areas, because of, you know, lions, hippos, and buffalo. While you can most certainly make the safari chic work for you by opting for the more stylish and modern cousins of the original, it’s also totally fine to go for the same cute clothes you’d wear at home, while keeping a few general rules in mind:  Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Africa here: Also, if you’ll be traveling to Cape Town, leave a little room in your bag to do some shopping. The local designers there are talented and have access to super cool fabrics, and the exchange rate, at least right now, is in your favor if on the Euro, Dollar, and GBP. I got custom shoes and these adorable shorts for way less than I would have at home. Each time I travel to Africa, I tend to bring my Pacsafe 55L backpack with me. It’s lined with Exomesh which makes it slash-proof, the zippers lock, and it has RFID-blocking technology so that theives can’t ‘bump into’ me and scan my credit card and passport info. I also bring along a smaller cross-body purse and wallet that has space for multiple currencies. They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well. I make myself the least attractive target that way. I also lock up my belongings in my Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa. Sadly, it’s often pressure from local mobsters on the people working in the hotels, or desperation given how low the wages are in most of Africa. There are a few more absolute essentials that you should bring from home that you will struggle to find in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and major cities like Nairobi, Kigali, and Lusaka: If you’re camping, I highly recommend the following: Insurance, immunizations, and meds: Travel insurance is an important addition to this packing list because it keeps you covered in the worst case scenario, which is being flown to a country where you can get the proper care you need. I use World Nomads since their explorer option also covers adventurous activities like hiking and scuba diving. You might be surprised to find that in major cities in Africa, like Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi, and surely plenty of others, immunizations and anti-malarial pills are way cheaper and often don’t require a prescription. I always buy my anti-malarials on the ground (though it’s important to take them before you will be exposed, so plan ahead). Keep in mind, Africa is huge, and this list is meant for those traveling through the southern and eastern countries with some suggestions for the far north as well. If you’re just sticking to South Africa, modesty isn’t a big concern and staples like hair products and sunscreen are easy to replace, but as you head more north and east, expect things to get a lot more lean and basic and you may be shocked at how difficult it is to find things that are totally common back home. Plan ahead and you’ll have a blast! Enjoy the beautiful adventure in comfort and style, and not in head-to-toe beige safari gear! *Some of these links are affiliate links and BMTM sponsors. Anything you purchase helps to support this site at absolutely no additional cost to you. Much love!  Everything on this list is SO cute. I’m so not with it when it comes to packing right. haha. I ALWAYS pack 50% OK stuff and the other half is “wtf was I thinking.” I’m getting better though! I really like to safari shorts for anytime actually! And all the unicorn things… I need unicorn things! haha. I wish I was a hat person but my hair is too big. lol. Thanks for this info, Kristin! I used to pack pretty badly too but I’m getting a lot better now. Lots of trial and error! I love hats because that African sun is intense! Hi Kristin,Thanks as always for the amazing posts.Did you use the same Ariat hiking boots in Kyrgystan?Thank you! I did not, I used another pair I have from Quechua and they’re not as nice. Lesson learned. Hi Kristin,Saw this post and guess what, I’m currently in Cape Town and want to do a little shopping? Where would you recommend? I found some awesome boutiques with stuff made by local designers on Long Street and in Woodstock. Check out the Neighbourhood Goods Market on Saturdays too. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I’m planning to spend some time in east Africa alone next year – an overland trek, some time in Kigali and maybe Tanzania and a couple of days in Nairobi. This is the part I’m worried about. I’d like to go to the David Sheldrick wildlife trust and maybe a few other places and I want to stay somewhere inexpensive. Are hostels a safe place to stay in Nairobi for a single woman traveler? I think you mentioned them but they sound a bit sketchy….probably the stereotypical Nairobi fear that you spoke of. Where do you stay in Nairobi if just for a few days.Thank you,Gina I haven’t actually been to Nairobi but have been to other big cities in the area like Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha, Kigali, and Kampala. I would just only walk during the day, and take cabs longer distances or at night. Ask at your hostel where is safe to go and where isn’t. Most hostels are locked with guards and plenty of other travelers, so I’ve felt OK in them. Have fun! Hi. I’m planning on a three months trip whatever I have time for of Malawi, Mosambik, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. I consider going alone as a female 27 years old and will use my experience of solo travels through south east asia and tanzania with a girl friend of mine. I want to travel with hand luggage, but I guess that is not a good idea if I will have to cary a bunch of sun screen to some places!? I am typical scandinavian with light skin and blonde hair. Also I wonder what is the easiest way to get from country to country? Where should I begin my trip? Thank you 🙂 Sunscreen is a good idea, especially since it’s hard to find once you reach East Africa, apart from in big cities. You could just bring several small bottles. As much as I hate suggesting so many small plastic items, it’ll help you go carry on only. It makes sense to fly into South Africa and go through Namibia to Botswana and work your way up and east. Local buses really suck, but they work. You can also sometimes take trains and long distance buses, or join an overland tour. This packing list is helpful. I am off for Cape Town in April. Thanks Have fun! What did you pack for an adapter so you could use hair tools?  I would like to bring a curling iron or straightener but most adapters I see say not to use hair tools with them! I don’t own any curling irons or straighteners! Sorry I can’t help more. HI Kristin thank you for writing everything in detail. I checked overland tours from Kenya to Tanzania nd they are super expensive, starting g from 1500 USD. Flight is even more expensive. I am travelinging solo, what will be the best way to travel between Zanzibar, Tanzania and Kenya? Not sure how many days that is but if you’re solo that might be the best way to go – something like an Acacia Africa or G adventures is the cheapest. Otherwise you can do public transport but I have to warn you it’s rough in that part of the world. Overcrowded vans with bald tires and massive delays constantly.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/namibia-game-reserves/,Wildlife in Namibia: Finding Life in Africa’s Desert Country,Namibia," When I think of Namibia I think of red hot dunes slowly shifting with the winds. I think of great natural wonders like Fish River Canyon and the Skeleton Coast. I think of sandboarding and adventures across the desert while gazing at the ocean. There is one thing that doesn’t always necessarily come to mind when I think about Namibia, though, and that’s the wildlife. If you’re coming to Africa for the wildlife you may think about giving desert-like Namibia a skip. I never knew that any creature could survive in such harsh and inhospitable conditions, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The wildlife in Namibia is nothing short of incredible. At times when we weren’t even looking, we saw cheetah, oryx, wild horses, seals, and flamingos. Who says you have to go on an all out expensive African safari to see some animals when it’s all waiting for you in Namibia? Go to Namibia for the sand dunes, canyons, and oceans , but stay for the animal sightings. Here is a guide to finding the best and more diverse wildlife in Namibia:  Shortly after seeing Fish River Canyon, the second largest canyon in the world, we made our way to the strange German town of Luderitz. Luderitz is small town located right between the desert and the ocean. From Luderitz you can explore the Luderitz Peninsula. It is chalk full of wildlife, where you can find oryx, brown hyena, jackals, flamingos, springbok, and more. However, it is the marine that is the star of the show in Luderitz. Visitors can spot the rare Haviside’s Dolphin. Whales such as the minke, southern right, fin, and pygmy right can also be spotted in season not far out of Luderitz Bay. Our personal favorite in the area is the massive penguin colony on Halifax Island. 125 kilometers outside of Luderitz is the tiny mountain town, Aus.  Just outside of Aus is Garub which is nothing more than a wheel in the desert. It is there you can find the feral horses of the desert, as it is the only place to drink for kilometers.    You may be thinking that horses aren’t exactly wildlife, but seeing the horses that have been untamed by humans and surviving in the desert is truly special. We came up on them late in the afternoon and watched them from a distance. We must have peaked their curiosity because about 50 of them started trotting towards our direction. It was apparent these horses were hungry and suffering from the drought and saw us as a source of food. Although, they were wild the horses were still so tame, calm, and with a completely different demeanor than the average stable horse. Good to know: The wild horses haven’t been so wild these past few years. Namibia is going through a major drought so the Gondwana Klein Aus Vista lodge has been donating hay to keep the horses alive. To see the wild horses I suggest staying nearby at Gondwana’s Klein-Aus-Vista camp or at an Airbnb in Luderitz. I came to realize that what is most astonishing about the Namib desert are the species that live and have adapted to the brutal forces of nature. We drove far into the NamibRand Nature Reserve with one of the local guys showing us around to see just that. He was telling us about his family, his life in Namibia, and his favorite foods before he started screaming “A cheetah! Look, there’s a cheetah!” We couldn’t believe our eyes – there in front of us was a real life cheetah in the middle of the Namib desert. He sprinted across the road in the blink of an eye, before we could even realize what had happened.  Our next seven days in the desert were filled with zebra, snakes, hyena, springbok, white mongooses, and thousands of gemsbok. Gemsbok (or oryx) are beautiful gray antelope that look like they were painted perfectly with black and white strips. They have massive horns which they use to fight one another and are very skittish creatures. I saw my first oryx near the Fish River Canyon and thought it was the beautiful animal in Africa. Before I knew it I was in the desert seeing thousands! The national animal of Namibia should be the oryx! As if cheetahs, zebra, and springbok aren’t enough we were even informed that there are desert giraffe and elephant in the Namib desert. We never saw them with our time there as they are quite rare, but they can be found in Damaraland to the North. Good to know: To truly get a glimpse of the desert landscapes and wildlife I recommend staying for at least two days and truly get to know southern Namibia and the desert.  Stay: To see the wildlife in the desert I suggest staying on the incredible NamibRand Nature Reserve.  Swakopmund is the highlight of many travelers’ Namibian road trip. Like Ludertiz the city is set right in between the ocean and the desert making it the perfect adventure destination. Sandboarding, four wheeling, paragliding, and skydiving are very popular options here. Once you are exhausted from all the activities head south to Swakop’s sister city, Walvis Bay. Walvis Bay is Namibia’s main port down and there isn’t a whole lot going on there. However, there are a few things going for it and one is the chance to see thousands of greater and lesser flamingos. These pink birds call Walvis Bay home all year round.  We ended up staying for four days in Walvis Bay and watched the sun rise and set with the flamingos. Their “honks” became a common sound to hear and watching them feed all day was more than entertaining. The flamingos are steps away from the shore so you get a chance to get up close and personal with them here. Walvis Bay is also famous for the massive great white pelican that can be found in the bay and along the massive salt flats just south of town. Good to know: Swakopmund is one of the biggest cities in Namibia. From coffee shops to hardware stores you should be able to find just about anything you need in Swakop. For a real treat keep driving past Walvis Bay to Pelican Point. More bird wildlife and stunning salt flats are to be seen here.  Stay: To see the wildlife in Walvis Bay I suggest an Airbnb rental in either Swakopmund or Walvis Bay. 120 km north of Swakopmund is the Cape Cross Seal Reserve. Here you can find one of the largest colonies of Cape Fur seals in the world! We debated long and hard about making the special trip to see the seals and subjecting ourselves to the smelliest place in Namibia, but eventually decided that we couldn’t miss the sight even if it was just a bunch of smelly seals. As soon as we arrived it was obvious we had made a great call. I could have never of expected the sheer number of seals that were at the reserve. Not just thousands, but tens, possibly hundreds of thousands of seals were here flopping around, “honking” at each other, and basking lazily in the sun. We visited in mid-November which unbeknownst to us was breeding season, so that meant thousands of newborn pups too! Some of the pups were only a matter of hours old. If traveling Namibia in November it is an absolute must.  Good to know: The Cape Cross Seal Reserve is a protected area in Namibia. To help with conservations foreign visitors are required to pay 80 NAD to enter. We stayed for about an hour, but if you have a weak stomach the smell may get the best of you. I recommend bringing something to cover your nose with. And most importantly plan to burn your clothes after… Stay: To see the seals I suggest camping along the way or staying in Swakopmund and driving up. Etosha National Park is not only the top wildlife destination in Namibia but one of the best game parks in all of Africa. The park is only a four-hour drive from the capital city, Windhoek, making it easily accessible for people on a short trip to the country. The massive Etosha Salt Pan covers a large swath of the park and it is a sight to see. There are hundreds of different mammals and bird species in the park. The park is also home to the Big 5 (Rhino, Elephant, Leopard, Lion, and Buffalo).  We spent two days in Etosha and had amazing sightings at just about every watering hole. Our favorite sighting was at the Gaseb watering hole just after passing through Okaukuejo. We arrived around 10 am thinking it would be too late to see anything, but decided to hang around just for kicks. Within ten minutes giraffe, ostriches, oryx, zebra, jackals, wildebeest, and impala had all come to get a drink. We watched with excitement for over 30 minutes barely wanting to leave. We told each other we would return to the Gaseb watering hole at sunset to see if there was any new activity for the day. Good thing we kept to our word for when we returned there had been a lion kill with hyenas, jackals, and vultures waiting for a chance to eat.  The key to seeing a variety of wildlife in Etosha is to set up camp at a watering hole and wait for the animals to come for a drink. It’s exceptionally hot here so animals often flock to where the water is. Other watering holes that we found interesting were Chudob and Ngobib near the Von Lindequist gate. Good to know: Etosha National Park is one of the most affordable parks in Africa at 80 NAD for foreigners. The park opens at sunrise and closes at sunset. For the best chance to see wildlife I recommend avoiding midday in the park. The animals get as hot as you and will be hard to spot as they hide from the sun.  Stay: To see Etosha I suggest not staying in the expensive campsites in the park and instead at Gondwana’s Etosha Camp near the Anderson Gate or Onguma Campsite near the Von Lindequist gate. Check the online map for more details.   If you want to recreate our visits to the various game reserves and wildlife sightings around Namibia, here’s a map to help you get there:  Any visit to Namibia is bound to bring you one step closer to some of Africa’s best wildlife. There was never a dull moment in Namibia for us, just make sure to grab a camera and relish in the natural and untouched beauty of the country. We’re off to Botswana and Zimbabwe next to delve deep into the Okavango Delta and the jungles of Africa – stay tuned.

I had no idea the desert had so much wildlife in it. It sounds truly spectacular. Thanks so much for sharing your experience. You make me want to see it for myself–especially those cute flamingos! Thank you for all the information. I am planning just 2 nights in Luderitz before heading inland. I am not really interested in the history or looking round the time, but want to make the most of being at the coast to see marine life and birds as well as any other animals that might be around. Can you suggest the best way of doing this or who might be able to help us in Luderitz?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-places-in-southern-africa-for-safari/,Three of the Best Places in Southern Africa for Safari,Namibia,"An African safari is one of those experiences I’ve wanted to have ever since learning that “Z is for zebra” in my early years. Picture books filled my mind with images of what Africa might be like. I imagined a bright, brilliant sun and animals walking around casually, appearing out of nowhere. In the national parks, that was entirely true. It really was the way I’d imagined it as a child. When visitors travel to southern Africa, most visit Kruger National Park in South Africa, hit Cape Town, and leave without seeing much else. While these two spots are famous for a reason, with great tourist infrastructure and options for all levels of adventure and price ranges suitable for all, I wanted to test out some other places that were a bit lesser known, simply to see what else might be out there. Expedia asked me to think about my favorite in South Africa (which was in the Karoo) for those who seek adventure while they travel and like to do things off the tourist trail. Check out that link if you’re interested in my SA suggestion. However, it got me thinking about parks elsewhere that I loved. The following are national parks in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia, all of which had amazing camp grounds nearby, fewer tourists, and impressive animal sightings. If you’re like me and you’ve been wanting to see these animals since childhood like I did, they won’t disappoint: Namibia was good. It was so, so very good. Every time I think back on it, I feel the warm desert heat again and I remember jumping out of planes, climbing sand dunes and boarding back down them, seeing some of the most iconic scenery in the world, gazing at the night sky and finding a full milky way of stars, and I feel so happy to have experienced it. My last stop in Namibia was Etosha National Park, which was incorporated in 1907 and spans 8,600 square miles (22,270 square kilometers). Since the park is partially a massive salt pan and experiences low rainfall – it is a desert, after all — animal spotting is a bit more likely. Taking our own truck through the park, we spotted the normal zebra and springbok that I had seen in South Africa, but then spotted a few things I hadn’t seen there before: two black rhinos, a male lion with a full mane, and a honey badger. That’s right, a honey badger, easily the most badass animal, like, ever. Rhinos are less and less common to see on safari these days due to illegal poaching which has put them at critically endangered numbers. The horns are believed by certain nationalities to promote vitality and power when ground up into a powder and therefore the illegal trade of their horns has put them at severe risk of extinction. Even Prince Harry is highly concerned about it. Etosha is one of the parks where it’s still possible to see them, though we were particularly lucky to see two during our visit. Do it yourself: Rent a vehicle or camper and camp at Okaukuejo camp within the park limits. It has a watering hole that draws in game at night, including rhinos and elephants. Botswana was the first country I spotted the majestic, and huge, African elephant. I had seen them in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia before, and it was entirely true that African elephants are quite a bit bigger and all of them have tusks. Asian elephants are also hairy and freckled, whereas African elephants are entirely grey, hairless, and have massive ears. Cruising along the Zambezi River for a few hours around sunset remains a favorite memory of mine from Botswana. There were more elephants than I could count, along with buffalo, hippos, and crocodiles everywhere. Even though the movie, the Lion King is set in Kenya, it seemed like every animal in the movie was present and that it could easily have been set in Botswana, along with the brilliant setting sun, appearing bigger than I’d ever seen it before. Do it yourself: The closest town to the park is Kasane with lots of camping options. I wasn’t a huge fan of the management at my camp and will therefore not recommend them by name. However I would recommend the company I went on Safari through Namibia, Botswana, Zambia (and beyond) with – here’s my exact booking with Acacia Africa. The South Luangwa National Park was my final safari in Africa and a great way to finish off the string of wildlife sightings. The camp I stayed at regularly had elephants wandering by the pool and hippos bellowing in the waters nearby. It was important that we shine a flashlight and look around before exiting the tents at night – that’s how prevalent the wildlife was! While on safari in the park I finally saw a leopard, a hippo with an open mouth (yawning I think?), and rarest of all, wild dogs. Do it yourself: Camp at the Wildlife Camp, which can organize a safari for you through the park where private vehicles are not permitted. Sunset is the best time to drive through, but bring along glasses and a jacket as the insects at night are plentiful and the vehicle is open-air *Thanks Expedia for inspiring this post, and thanks Southern Africa for being completely mind blowing Beautiful photos, I’m looking foreward to hearing more about Africa! How did you find the pace of the tour, crossing several countries in just over a month? Did you see many people travelling independently in the campgrounds? Do you still recommend travelling that region of Africa with a tourgroup? It was absolutely wonderful and slow paced enough in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia. Sped up a bit once we left Livingstone so that was a bit tough but I think it’s a great way to travel through the area and no, I didn’t see many independent travelers though there were some. This great parks! Love all of them! But have a very special place in my heart for South Luangwa! 🙂 Beautiful photos! I really liked that too and that’s where I saw my leopard! Hi Kristin, we recently went to all these places you just mentioned and had a fabulous time. AMAZING picture of a black rhino. Really. I was just scrolling at first and then stopped, and said, wait that looks like a black because of the mouth and sure enough you said it was. After realizing how difficult it is to get good photos of the black rhinos, stunning shot. Thanks so much, Tiffany! We got so lucky. He was just hanging out for a good 30 minutes, walking around and allowing us to get some seriously amazing shots. Oh, I am SO envious of your honey badger sighting!! In the daytime, too–how’d you manage that?! Darlington (the guide) has good eyes! Wow!!! Doing an African safari has always been one of my biggest dreams, and this only makes me want to up and leave now more than ever. Your photos are beautiful, those sunsets are something to behold for sure! I can’t imagine seeing those animals up close and in the wild. Full disclosure – these were all taken with a telephoto lens so I was still a safe distance away, but close enough to really get a sense of how majestic they are which was awesome. Great article! I LOVE Botswana so much I’m moving there for a couple of years. Chobe is definitely a highlight! P.s I had Darlington as a guide too! Small world 🙂 He’s the best! Botswana really was SO GOOD for wildlife. Amazing photos! Going on a safari is at the top of my bucket list, and I really want to go soon. There are so many amazing places to choose from though, so thank you for narrowing down some of them. When I go I will definitely have to triple check that my camera is working perfectly! public health of NY wants to charge for advice on vaccinations – what is required for Zambia as well as suggested for spending 16 days traveling I can’t answer that for you, however you’ll want at least Hepatitis A and Typhoid so it’s worth it to go. Probably also antimalarials and Yellow Fever as well.     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/swakopmund-adventure-activities/,"Adventures in Swakopmund, Namibia: Sandboarding and Skydiving",Namibia,"Sand. Sweat. Sun. A cooling wind to follow, from jumping out of a plane. I stood on the edge of the dune in Swakopmund, Namibia. It looked impossibly steep and I thought of my shoulder surgery. It has been years, but it still sticks in my mind when I’m looking at the edge of something I’m about to slide down or jump off of at top speed. “I’m not going to believe that coming from someone who’s wearing a skydiving shirt,” joked Chris, the instructor, when I said I was a bit nervous to stand up-board down the dune face. The sand wasn’t like the icy snow in the mountains near home in California, though. It’s a fine, soft landing and though steep, not too difficult to learn on. Easily alternating between fast and slow with a heel and toe motion, the end of the run came quickly and left me wanting more. Hoisting the board back up, I eyed the dune once again. Another steep climb. I was going to have to earn these runs. From the top of the dune, a shining blue ocean beckons, as if teasing that only it can offer some relief from the heat. Skwakopmund sits on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia, nestled between the oldest desert in the world and the Atlantic ocean. For me it was an active place, full of far too many activities to try during my two days there. Reminiscent of its German colonial history, the town of under 50,000 people in a country of 2 million is an interesting mix of Europe and Africa. Markets with tribal wares sit alongside German-style cafes serving up sausages. It offers the small town charms of dive bars, Sunday farmer’s markets, people who recognize you after a day or two, and of course, a wide array of adventure activities. With so many choices such as quad biking, dolphin cruising, horse riding and skydiving (more on that later), sandboarding with Alter Action sounded the most unique to me and therefore was put at the top of my list. I did fall, but it didn’t hurt much. I did get pockets, ears, hair, and a mouth full of sand, but I didn’t mind much. Even two months later, I’m still finding sand at the bottom of my bag. It was worth it, though, and as big kids what’s better than playing in a giant sand box? Few things, I’d say. After the fourth run it was time to head off for skydiving with Ground Rush Adventures. The day was packed but it was perfect because I didn’t have any down time to think about the fact that I’d be flying through the air, tempting fate and putting all of my trust in a parachute, soon. I wondered if it would be like bungee jumping. I still didn’t know how I felt about it a month after jumping off of Bloukran’s bridge in South Africa, the highest natural bungee jump in the world and the first I’d ever tried. I met the guy I’d be jumping tandem with, Francois, and immediately felt at ease. He’s the kind of guy I’d be friends with, whether I was strapped to him and trusting him with my life or not. He approached it with such excitement and enthusiasm that it was hard for me to have any fear. The scariest part of a skydive is the buildup. Sitting in the plane as it goes higher and higher, way past the point where it seems it should stop and with entirely too much time to think, is the worst. I was oddly relaxed and excited, though, knowing that I didn’t really have to do anything but spread my wings and fly. The launch felt completely different to jumping off of a bridge. There was a free-fall, yes, but at that altitude and watching everything below me, felt slower and almost peaceful. When bungee jumping, my body was moving faster than my brain could comprehend, which is why the free-fall is so damn scary. The body is sending panic signals to the brain quicker than the brain can say, “it’s cool, there’s a rope strapped to you!” Skydiving was different, the rush of warm wind – so warm that I didn’t even need a jump suit – and the gorgeous setting sent so much dopamine through my brain that I instantly fell in love with the sensation. Before I knew it, the parachute was deployed and Francois, sensing that I wasn’t even an ounce of scared, placed the handles in my hands and said, “pull!” We spun quickly in one direction, me laughing and he pulling my hand down even harder so that we’d go faster, then in the other direction. I wanted it to last forever. As we touched down on the ground, a crowd of friends from my Acacia crew smiling and waving at the bottom ran over with hugs and a glass with brandy. Ever since that glorious day I’ve toyed with the idea of returning in order to get certified to jump solo. I could do that all day, every day, and never get tired of it. It looks like I’ve found a new addiction. *Acacia, Ground Rush, and Alter Action brought this post to you. However, you will never read a positive review on BMTM for an activity that I did not love. Your trust always comes first.  Do it Yourself:  Love how you got all the badassery covered! Thanks for all the details of what exactly goes on in your mind while that plane is rising up :D. Also, that tank top in the 1st picture = dope! Thanks Archana! Yes all the sandy badassery! Haha. The plane going up is the hardest part – the rest is in the hands of the instructor anyways. I’ve always wanted to try sky diving. I like your description of it – and I think I like the idea of that more than bungee jumping. Now that you’ve done both, which do you prefer? I prefer sky diving for sure but I still do like bungee jumping and did something similar – gorge swing – in Victoria falls after this. You bungee then swing at the bottom. I loved it so much I went 3 times! That tank top rocks – I love finding unique shirts from places I go (not like, uhm Hard Rock !) and that has to be one of the cooooooolest. Can’t decide whether to sandboard, skydive, or take a nice flight over the dunes. So much to choose from! Thanks! I love getting clothes as souvenirs when I travel but agree, not from hard rock! haha What an exciting experience, my heart beats faster even thinking of skydiving. But, hopefully I can try one soon 🙂 http://theodoregreat.blogspot.com/ You’re such a bad ass! I love it =) Haha if only. Thank you 🙂 This is my dream trip! Probably the coolest place on Earth to Skydive.  I just booked a road trip to Namibia with my boyfriend this Fall for 3 weeks. Can’t wait to explore all these sights and go skydiving. Your photos are unreal… Thanks for sharing Kristin! 🙂 That’s awesome! It’s definitely up there in my favorite country list. So beautiful and with an endless list of things to do. That view really is amazing. I just got a rush reading your post so I can only imagine how much better it was like in real life! Thanks, Tiffany! Was such a rush that I definitely need to do it again! (and again, and again, and then probably again) Hey!Thanks for all the great reviews on Swakopmund. It is our favourite place in Namibia and we often go on the weekends.A visit to Sandwich Harbour is another must-do.We are tour and safari guides in Nambia, after leaving our lives in Europe. If you come back we’d love to show you around Windhoek and the Caprivi strip is another favourite of ours 🙂https://www.facebook.com/followthetravelguides/ Thanks!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/namibia-dune-45/,Namibia’s Sandy Wonderland: The Orange Dunes of Sossusvlei,Namibia,"The sky went from pitch black, dotted with a milky way of stars stretching from one corner to the other in an arc, to a royal blue. The sun was rising faster than my feet could carry me and I worried that the peak would be unreachable in time. There was a steady stream of people behind me and I couldn’t simply stop. It was too narrow for anyone to pass, and we were on unsteady sand, after all. An inner voice urged me to keep going, just as it had when I climbed Rinjani, despite that for every two steps forward I was sliding one back. I pulled my socks off and continued barefoot in the incredibly soft sand, and suddenly invigorated by the foot massage, doubled my speed. Huffing and puffing and reaching the peak of Dune 45 in the Namib desert with time to spare, I plunked myself down and stared in awe as the sun began to peek over the hills. I’d been the second person to reach the peak and got prime positioning, just in the nick of time. The first time I saw this place in photos I vowed that I would see it with my own two eyes one day. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, there’s something magical about the peace and barrenness of a desert. The sun finally rose completely and as I surveyed the beauty in every direction, my first time in a sandy desert, I felt exuberant at the sight unfolding before me. The colors of the dunes varied quite a bit depending on the angle of the sun and the direction the dune was facing. The orange became more intense as the sun rose higher, reflecting on the desert as it morphed from one scheme of colors to another. This is, without a doubt, a bucket list item. If you think you don’t love deserts, try this one on for size. I watched as the crowd thinned after the sun had fully risen. While they headed back down, I turned in the other direction, heading for a vista I could enjoy solo. It didn’t take long to reach the dunes just behind Dune 45, spotted with hoofed Kudu footprints and still slightly shaded. I stepped down a bit and with that, the last person disappeared and the 360-degree view was mine. Be sure to do that if you find yourself in the Namib Desert. It was a humbling experience being surrounded by the sandy giants. No visit to Sossusvlei, Namibia, would be complete without checking out the famous Acacia trees of Deadvlei (Afrikaans for ‘dead marsh’), so after descending Dune 45, it was time to board jeeps and head to another dune. The jeep driver laughed, a silver star implanted in one of his front teeth (a common fashion statement there), as he described climbing the next dune. Its name is “Big Daddy” as it reaches 350 meters high. You have a choice to avoid climbing this dune and just walk along the dried salt pan to the Acacia trees, but I honestly found it easier than Dune 45. It wasn’t nearly as steep and lots of people before me had packed down the sand and left nice footprints for me to step in. Besides, you get a great view: From the top, simply step-slide (barefoot is best) down the side of the dune to reach the “dead marsh.” The sand feels great on the feet! These famous trees had the chance to grow when the nearby Tsauchab river flooded, creating shallow pools. As the climate changed, drought hit the area and the sand dunes moved in, thereby cutting off any water supply. The remaining trees died, but due to the dryness, their scorched black skeletons still stand after 900 years. I loved the way the branches eerily reach towards the sun. Despite the fact that these trees are no longer living, they still seem to have a personality, and an energy, to them. By noon, I made my escape as the desert heated up and the ground became too hot to walk on. It was only my third day in Namibia, but already a sign of great things to come. Have you been here? Would you like to go? Are you also thinking to yourself, “Hey, the Snapseed trees!” (’cause I was).  Do It Yourself: Stay: Travel with: Practical tips: Wow…just wow.I haven’t managed to make it to Africa yet but after seeing these photos I NEED to! I love deserts! I just love them. They are mystic places where all human worries are just useless. Great pics and article! These pictures are stunning! You just keep adding places to my list haha Thanks and great! These pictures stole my heart, Kristin. I have always dreamt of exploring Africa and this post just boosted that dream. Thanks for sharing and also thanks for mentioning Rinjani, haha, that dreadful but remarkable mountain 😉 Kh Sheena Dreadful but remarkable, indeed! Glad this inspired you to visit Namibia. It really is beautiful. well said maybe that’s why it felt so much like a giant playground. Cannot wait to go this summer – awesome fotos! Thank you! One of the easiest places to brilliantly photograph in the world, I’d say! Hey Kristin! I am absolutely in love with these photos. The ultimate dream… I have a question, which tour did you take with Acacia Africa? Was it the ‘Desert Tracker (19 days)’? I am actually very interested in booking a tour with them next year but wouldn’t want to miss the chance to see these dunes…Thanks for the info, and thank you for your blog! Coralie Hi Coralie, That one takes you through the same parts of Namibia and Botswana I visited. It was a wonderful tour and the highlight for me of my time with Acacia. I did the 35-day Cape Town to Zanzibar trip but the Desert Tracker is great if you have less time. This is one of my favorite places….ever. I loved Namibia, and your pictures certainly do the dunes justice! Thanks Heather! I spent hours photographing them. Couldn’t stop. Namibia is just so damn photogenic. Hi Kristin- Hiking Dune 45 was a huge highlight of our Nairobi to Cape Town overland trip. When we pulled up I didn’t think the dune looked that high. Once I got going though, wow, it’s a lot higher than it looks and sand is difficult to walk in/up. 🙂 You got some incredible photos, sure to inspire someone else to make the trip to Namibia! I wish I could have gone as far as Nairobi! I definitely want to go back and start in Zanzibar and finish with Uganda, yet another month of overland camping in East Africa! Something so wonderful about it even though it’s most definitely roughing it. And yeah, that sand on Dune 45 makes it so much more than just a hill to climb. Stunning ! I visited Botswana a few years ago and I loved it…now I wish I had also made it to Namibia 🙂 There’s so much to see and so many reasons to go back I came across you on instagram. I love your posts and reading about your travels makes each day harder to go into the office. I was in Namibia 2 years ago and reading your post makes it very hard for me not to buy a ticket right now. I am now looking for more of your Africa posts to inspire my next adventure. Hi Michelle, that’s so awesome that you found me via Instagram! I wasn’t sure there was much crossover, so that’s pretty cool! Gosh Namibia is so nice and warm. I’m sitting in Europe right now in the middle of winter and I’m also quite tempted to buy a plane ticket back there!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/fish-river-canyon-namibia/,"From One River to Another, Leaving South Africa for Namibia",Namibia,"Leaving South Africa caused a stirring of bewildering emotions in my chest. This always happens when I leave a place: I start to get a yearning feeling in the pit of my stomach. My heart beats a bit faster. I feel a sudden urge to stay, along with the seductive pull of the unexplored ahead of me. It’s like an internal tug-of-war with a sentimental longing for the familiar on one side and inquisitiveness for the new on the other. Does it happen to you, too? I think it’s called a bitter sweet goodbye. After nine weeks in beautiful South Africa, it was time to enter Namibia, passing from the Orange River on the border to the Fish River Canyon in Namibia. You’re not going to believe this, but I chose to do so in a fashion that I haven’t done in eight years. I joined an overland safari and I would be on the truck for 35 days. That would be 35 days of camping in a tent, without a bed, 35 days of doing chores like helping with cooking and cleaning, and 35 days of living out of a locker on a truck. It would mean 35 days of someone else doing the planning, and being surrounded by other people, not so solo anymore. Yes, 35 whole days. Generally everything I do is solo and independent. I don’t like tours and am really not a fan of excessive hand-holding. However, I did my homework on this one and realized that if I wanted to see Namibia and the surrounding countries, it was the only safe option. I am adventurous but I’m not stupid, and traveling solo across Asia with its bus system and big populations is not the same as driving a car solo across a barren, shade and water-free desert without any mechanical know-how when the possibility of seeing another car pass by is slim and cellular signal is nil. What I liked about this overland safari with Acacia Africa was that it wasn’t an air-conditioned, fancy resort, fake experience. It would involve pitching tents, avoiding scorpions, running barefoot in deserts, and seeing lions from a big truck as we powered through Southern and Eastern Africa. In short, it was an unexpectedly sublime adventure with a few awesome 20-something girls and guys. I got along with each person, and honestly loved finally letting someone else do the planning for a while. As you may have noticed, solo travel was starting to wear on me and I needed a little break. Getting my stamp as I left South Africa, walking through the incredible heat to the other side of the border and entering into Namibia, it became real – I was saying goodbye to a country that was more transformative for me than any before it. As I do with almost every place I visit, I silently vowed to return. The landscape quickly turned barren and mostly tree-less. However this is the perfect environment for me. I love the quiet stillness and seeming emptiness of deserts. Despite the fact that they are inhospitable to most life, I find them peaceful and particularly beautiful. I love the feeling of the hot, dry heat on my skin. Perhaps because I grew up with it and it’s what I’m used to, this is my preferred type of weather. The final stop of the night and the first Namibian sunset took place at Fish River Canyon, the largest canyon in Africa. A hiking trail runs through it, which is one of the most popular in Southern Africa. That said, as much as I love hiking, I probably wouldn’t consider it. The temperatures there regularly soar to 48°C (118°F)! To add to that, in the dry season, the river is often dried up in certain parts. No thank you.  I was surprised to find that people actually run this, though, with the fastest runner clocking in at just under 7 hours for 90km. Through the desert. Without shade. Wow. As the sun set we sipped wine and took in our new surroundings. For the next 12 days, we’d be exploring this desert country, with pockets full of sand, walking through forests of leafless trees on their way to petrification, and in my case, jumping out of planes. It would turn out to be a welcome change, after all. *This post, and following posts associated with the trip, was brought to you in collaboration with Acacia Africa. As always, you will never read a positive review on this site for an activity, product, or destination that I did not love. All opinions shared are genuine and my own. I can relate to this statement so much: “It’s like an internal tug-of-war with a sentimental longing for the familiar on one side and inquisitiveness for the new on the other” – I feel like I’m constantly plagued by this affliction! Your South Africa posts have me longing to revisit, and I look forward to reading about Namibia. Namibia was entirely wonderful too and I’m excited to relive it through the posts! The bitter sweet good buy is what remains. We remember emotions not facts.  I will eagerly await for your posts from Namibia – one of the countries on my travel bucket list. So true and it’s human nature to romanticize the past although I really did find South Africa to be transformative. There were honestly good and hard times, though. Indeed, it’s difficult to leave a place you love, even if it was a short stay. However, Namibia does look amazing and I’m sure you come to love it too. Thanks Kristin, I found your Africa posts really useful.  I’m about to embark on an African overland trip soon and wanted to see how you had done it since I also prefer off the beaten track type travel. Rather than going it alone, I went for the overland group travel for safety reasons too – it’s reassuring to see you did the same. Hi Laura, I’ve done both independently and with a group tour now, and ended up leading my own group tour through Namibia too! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/namibia-road-trip-itinerary/ I had such a good time on my first tour, honestly. I don’t usually love tours but I did love that one. I think it’s a good idea for a first-timer in the region.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-books-for-traveling-in-asia/,The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia,Nepal,"Reading is where I get the majority of my enjoyment these days. Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships. This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads. This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:    First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers by Loung Ung This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today.  It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading. It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.  Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute by Bua Boonmee First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is incredibly eye-opening. I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the Thai sex industry have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.  Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam by Andrew X. Pham This book was a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me. I personally really loved visiting Vietnam. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.  Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal by Conor Grennan Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal. Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family. Sold by Patricia McCormick Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world  in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change. (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)  What Makes You Not a Buddhist by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse The title of this book really is misleading.  It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger. I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a 10-day silent meditation in Thailand. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding. This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.  I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone! A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack. It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn. — I read all of my books on a Kindle because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books. Given I’m usually reading 2-3 at a time, I need them in electronic format. Plus, I can keep highlights and clippings of the books for later reference – which I do make use of. I am always looking to add to this list, so if you know of a great read, let me know! Lastly, these are affiliate links, which means if you make a purchase via the link, I get a very small percentage of the sale price. It’s not much but it does help me maintain this website. Now that I think about it, if you have someone special in your life that is traveling soon, one of the best gifts would be these books loaded on a Kindle. Just a thought! Happy travels.   I love this because I always try to read a book about the place I’m traveling to/in. I also appreciate that you highlighted books written by people who actually live or are from those countries. I think both  perspectives (insider vs outsider) are good, but I always tend to lean to the home country authors. Last, I read Catfish and Mandala about 10 years ago and I still remember how good it was! Which is at lot considering I often can’t remember books I read last year:) I like the first-hand narrative style of people from the countries as well. Sometimes it’s an outsider who wrote it as in the cases with the Nepal books, but the others gave me a better insight, I felt. Hi,I was going through the comments, and saw your reply asking for the affiliate link of the book Nothing to Envy. I will take this opportunity to send the link to youHere’s the link:Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea I loved your website and articles. You are doing a great job! Thanks and thanks! “The Red Market” by Scott Carney.By no means is this an uplifting book either but it does show you a dark world hidden within some countries like India, Philippines, & China.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061936463 It’s important to understand all aspects, I think. Not just the good parts. Thanks for the recommendation! Ah, amazing! I was just thinking one of my aims for my trip next year should be to read at least one book about each country I visit. This is a great selection to get me started. Wish I had some recommendations for you, I plan to have many by the end of my trip! Great then I look forward to your eventual recommendations! I know a must-read for Myanmar- From the Land of Green Ghosts http://www.amazon.com/From-Land-Green-Ghosts-Burmese/dp/0060505230 Awesome, thank you! Thank you, Kristin for your great list of book. Next week I will go to Myanmar and I was glad find book about this country in comment to this post. Now I read “From the Land of Green Ghosts” and expect very interesting travel. I just love the commenters on this blog! They’re so helpful. Anything on China? I’m heading there in a few days. I’ve been reading China in Ten Words by Yu Hua, which has been a fairly easy read and talks about the author’s upbringing during the Cultural Revolution, among other things. I’m definitely going to check out What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Thanks! I’ve read a lot of textbooks about China, especially modern Chinese politics (it was an area of study for me at University) but not as many memoirs. A good friend of mine loves My Several Worlds by Pearl S. Buck. There’s a novel called To Live by Yu Hua that you might find very interesting. It’s about a formerly rich family’s struggle as Mao rises to power. There actually are a lot of memoirs about China, too many of them. The most popular ones are Peter Hessler’s books, works by Xinran, Wild Swans, Wild Grass, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. I personally recommend Ancestral Leaves by Joseph W. Esherick, which chronicles his wife’s family through most of Modern Chinese history. As a historian, he knows his facts. Many of them focus on the turbulence of the Mao Era or the strains on society caused by the neck-breaking  pace of development. Pearl S. Buck, writes from the Republican era. Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a good place to start for contemporary Chinese literature. He works tend to be a bit political and focus on Chinese society. Soul Mountain, also by a Chinese Nobel laureate for literature, Gao Xingjian, is in contrast a much more personal journey and doesn’t touch much on the social upheavals of the era. The Republican era was a golden era for Chinese arts and literature. Writers from that era, such as Lu Xun, Xiao Hong, Ba jin, Qian Zhongshu, and Lao Shu, are still deeply revered in modern Chinese society. Thanks so much for the suggestions, Paul! It’s clear to me now that I should have been reading a lot more books on China all along. It’s the country that fascinates me the most. Will definitely add some of these to my list of books to read and hopefully grow this post to include some of these. Oh, totally love this post. I’m always looking for books or movies that have the places I want to see in them. Great idea. 🙂 I absolutely adore The Lover for Vietnam. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Adapted from a book as well which I suppose I should have included here as I’ve read that one too but forgot about it until now! I’ve just started ‘Anil’s Ghost’ by Michael Ondaatje which touches on Sri Lanka during their civil war. So far I really love it – perhaps I am slightly biases since I was there in September and have a huge love for the country, but I would say it’s worth reading! I do as well since I was there about a year ago. Thanks for letting me know because I’d love to learn more about that beautiful island. Great list Kristen! I haven’t read Miss Bangkok, Sold, or What Makes You Not  Buddhist, but the others are great and really do have a lasting imrpession, especially when you read them in the country they’re set in. 🙂Reading books about different countries and their history, and other travellers’ account of their adventures is one of my favourite parts of travel!! You’ve read all the others? Nice! I guess great minds think alike. Out of those I’d recommend What Makes You Not Buddhist next, but that is my favorite book so I’m biased 🙂 For fiction, the Bangkok 8 series is interesting and entertaining. Certainly not an accurate representation of Thailand in general, but the author does highlight several finer points of Thai Buddhist practices and cultures that are fascinating and interesting to read about if you’ve spent some time there. I really enjoy books about Buddhism so I might like that one a lot. Ahhh thank you for the reminder that I have been meaning to read “First They Killed My Father” for three years now since first visiting Cambodia! Added it to the list. Great, great read. I just read a great book set in India, by Kiran Desai, called Hullabaloo In The Guava Orchard. A really easy, funny read, with engaging characters and great descriptive prose. Of course for fiction, there’s always Memoirs Of A Geisha, too, which I LOVE. One I really recommend is called Nothing To Envy, by Barbara Demick. There are accounts of six defectors who escaped North Korea during the massive famine that killed millions in the 90’s. Such a good book about a country that we don’t know that much about. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha as well! I read it in high school.  THANK YOU for the Nothing to Envy suggestion. I think I’ll read that next because N. Korea really fascinates me. If you have an affiliate link with amazon send it over 🙂 What a great list of books. Thanks! I think I’d start with the What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Its a great one to start with One of my absolute favorite books has always been Shantaram. I recommend it to everyone! Its a beautiful autobiography (some ppl do challenge this) of a convict from Australia who escaped prison and ran off to India. He really writes beautifully about living in the country and his adventures there.  And then of course if you want a lighter take on India, there’s always Holy Cow that helps balance off the two experiences =) I did read Shantaram and while I felt the guy was a good writer I just couldn’t get past his god complex. It bothered me. It did help me get a better feel for India (I guess?) but I didn’t love it enough for it to make the list. It was a compelling read, though. I give it a 6 out of 10. There are some great books here! Some of my favourites are A Fine Balance (India), Wild Swans (China), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan) and Ghostwritten (set in many locations, but the Mongolia story is my favourite). Maybe I should write my own post! Thanks for the recommendations! Looks like I need to do some China reading. Thanks for this list! I’m living in bangkok at the moment and really wanted some reading inspiration! What makes you not a Buddhist is honestly one of the most amazing books I’ve read, I’m going to spread the word it’s very rare to find something so grounded in fact and truth yet so magical at the same time. Keep doing what you’re doing – I love your blog! Xx Yay! I’m glad you liked the book! It really did change my life for the better. Oh, this brings back memories. I always used to try to read a book set in another country before I got there/while I was travelling around. I’m not quite sure when I got out of the habit. I’d like to do it again, though. Thanks for the inspiration! Always such a nice way to understand and appreciate a country’s history 🙂 I love to read about places that I’ve been too. I read a LOT of China books because it helps me grasp the country a bit more. You should check out Peter Hessler’s books – he’s an awesome writer. I’m really curious about the Buddhism book, it would be nice to learn a bit more. Awesome thank you. I think you’re the second to comment recommending Holy Cow so I’ll look that one up. The other sounds incredible as well. Thanks for the great list, I am excited to check these out. I always try to read books when traveling in a country – I feel like it gives so much great context and cultural understanding that you don’t always get just by interacting with locals. Here are a few that I found useful – for Cambodia – Report from the Stricken Land; for China – easily the best travel companion is China Road by Rob Gifford (also available as an excellent audio book); and for India – Inspite of the Gods – the rise of Modern India. All of these were written by journalists who covered these countries for decades and have plenty of anecdotes, historical knowledge and well rounded understanding of a range of subjects pertinent to these countries. Those are great suggestions! A lot on this list are written by locals but it would be great to get a journalist’s perspective as well. Thank you for the incredible list its helpful.. Great suggestions! I loved Catfish and Mandala! Although its not as deep and insightful… No touch monkey was a great lighthearted traveler’s book for southeast asia (and other parts of the world)… definitely recommend for a light read 🙂 Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely agree with the title at least! Thanks for the recommendation for: What Makes You Not a BuddhistGreat description and awesome read. Just finished the book this avo! Awesome I’m so glad you liked it! I was excited to see that a lot of people ordered that one. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone read it 🙂 I read “When Broken Glass Floats” while in Phnom Penh which is a similar memoir to First They Killed My Father. I had planned to read them both, but after the first one, I didn’t think I could handle reading about that tragic history again. The book reduced me to tears more than a few times, and like you say, made me appreciate the smiles and hospitality around the country so much more. The other books you’ve listed look great as well, Miss Bangkok looks powerful, and Bkk is one of my favourite cities ever – might have to read that one on my next plane ride there. Thanks! I cried too reading First They Killed My Father. I agree it might be tough to read two such memoirs back to back. I started reading one about a child soldier in Sierra Leone and wondered to myself why I read such tough books but then realized, it helps you appreciate the current situation much more and the need for love in this world more than ever. Hi Kristin, Did you use a travel guide in south east Asia? Awesome website by the way, inspiring and useful! X iris Nope. I never do. I get my ideas by talking to locals. Orwell’s first novel, Burmese Days, paints Colonial Burma in a satirical light and offers decent insight into old traditions such as chewing betel. It’s worth reading just to see Orwell’s nearly century old take on present day Myanmar as well as his stunning insights into the bureaucratic nonsense that came along with it. Thank you for the recommendation! Hi there, I really enjoyed reading your past updates and most recent post 🙂 I was recommended your blog by transient20s. I have just started on WordPress since I am just beginning my travels – not only to keep my own recording of the journey, but also to read other people’s recommendations and insights. Some of the stuff I have read so far is great and I would love if you had any other recommended bloggers etc for me to follow? I am 23 and my first post lists the places I will be visiting. Thank you! Rebecca x How kind of them to recommend me. Yes for sure! These are my faves: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-blogs/ I’ve always considered “The Beach” a must read for anyone visiting Asia, but I love your list. Will definitely try to read at least one of those books this year! I haven’t actually read it but based on the movie, can definitely see why. I was trying to think of things that are less based on fiction and more based on the culture of the countries, but should read that one as well. If you are travelling India I absolutely recommend “The God of Small Things” for some beautiful magic realism and accurate “images” of local kids. And of course I have to recommend the famous “the white tiger” also full of indian typical images and very very entertaining reading. Both Indian writers Would love to read them regardless! I love having a peek into a culture I’m not yet familiar with Yep, Catfish and Mandala is a good one. I read it long before I ever wen to SE Asia, but remember it as a compelling read. So compelling and well-written. I love reading people who are such great writers as they encourage me to improve. I loved Little Princes! I recently did a Buddhist temple stay here in Korea and loved my time there. I’ll definitely have to check out “What makes you not a Buddhist” as I really want to learn more about the religion.Thanks for the recommendation!Some of my favourites are Escape from camp 14, a book about one of the few people to have escaped from North Korea’s prisoner camps. A shocking but interesting read (although it came out recently that he had lied about a few things in the book)Into Thin Air is also a great read! I am so fascinated by North Korea so I’m definitely going to give that a read. Thank you for the suggestion! Are there book about Malaysia and How long can I use these book? I haven’t read one about Malaysia yet but when I do I’m happy to post about it! These are mostly memoirs and relevant any time. Thanks for the awesome list! I am definitely going to check them out, especially the one about Buddhism. When I’m in Thailand later this year I am going to check out a meditation retreat in a temple, so I should probably learn more about Buddhism first. 😛 That’s a really good idea and I was very glad I’d read that book prior to going simply to have the basics down when the monks referenced the Truths.  Is it this one you’re going to? Was a very profound experience for me: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/monastery-thailand/I have some tips to help you prep here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/suan-mokkh/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/rato-machhendranath-nepal/,Narrowly Escaping a Coconut Brawl in Nepal,Nepal,"Patan is the ancient capital of Nepal, located a 40-or-so-minute taxi ride outside of the Thamel (tourist) area of Kathmandu. My trekking buddy, Ellen, and I had heard about it from a fellow trekker while we tackled the Annapurna circuit.  When our plans had us in Kathmandu at the same time, we met up and elected to check out this ancient city. At first glance, Patan looks like a larger version of Durbar Square in Kathmandu, complete with the bogus entry fees for foreigners. Little did we know that we had arrived on a major holiday and were about to experience something truly out of the ordinary. While Ellen checked out the museum I wandered around the ruins. What I love about the Durbar Squares I’ve seen in Nepal, and especially Patan, is they’re not blocked off from human touch. All day long visitors — mostly locals — sit along the ridges and steps of the various temples enjoying the day, hanging out with their friends, or selling spices, flowers, and bracelets. I glanced at the time and realized I needed to eat something. The thing about hot weather is, sometimes I just forget to eat! There were plenty of cafes around pandering to tourists but that’s not what I wanted, so with a little more wandering, I found a little boy dishing up something called choila, which means “mix”. It involves pounded flat rice, which is crunchy, and in this case, some bamboo, chickpeas, and potatoes in gravy.  Sitting between an old, smiling, local man and two girls who asked the boy to give me more gravy, I felt happy to have found the perfect spot.  When I walked back to meet Ellen, playing ball with some kids in the square along the way, I ended up talking to the one of guys at the ticketing counter who asked me what I thought of the local Nepali food.  He had noticed me eating there, happy to see that I was trying to immerse myself a bit more in the local culture. As an added bonus, he explained there would be a tree-like float and at some point a coconut would be thrown from the top of it. Apparently this was a big festival during which a giant float had been paraded around the town all day, and it would all culminate in an hour or so just down the road from where we were at that moment. It didn’t make much sense to me but nevertheless, sounded too good to miss. The festival is called Rato Machhendranath after the god of rain (an incarnation of Shiva) whose temple in Durbar Square of Patan has been there since the 1600s.  Given this takes place right before monsoon season, it’s an opportunity to ask for rains for prosperous crop yielding. It’s celebrated by parading a chariot, or Bunga Dyah Jatra, through the streets. It culminates when a priest climbs the float and throws a coconut down into the crowd. Whoever catches the coconut is considered to be very lucky and has a great year ahead to look forward to. For this reason, the coconut isn’t claimed easily and usually a brawl ensues between the masses, each person eager to be the winner of good fortune. Little did we know this is one of the oldest and most important festivals in Nepal.  Walking about ten minutes down the street he pointed out, vendors all along the peripheries, tons of people walking through, seabuckhorn berries for sale wrapped in newspaper, the float finally made itself visible. “What the heck is that?!” There were riot police all along the sides, some smiling big when they saw Ellen and I, the only foreigners in a crowd of thousands. Others filming and taking pictures, just as much tourists as we were. A woman near the front of the float said, “namaste” (Nepali for “hello”), while throwing water at us as a blessing. A man threw a flower to me from the top of the float (which Ellen later said, “I’m not sure if it’s the same as in India, but if it is, he just proposed to you), and another applied a red powder bindi to my forehead. “You’d better move, when the coconut comes, there will be fighting,” one of the riot police said to Ellen as he began putting on his riot gear and readying his bamboo stick. Suddenly it made sense why there were so many people on the tops of buildings or watching from windows. The crowd went wild as a priest climbed the leaning tower of the chariot, coconut in hand. He kept indicating he might throw it on various sides of the chariot, faking everyone out and eliciting cheers each time he pretended to throw it in any given direction. Since Ellen and I were still very much in the crowd without many options of escape, I silently hoped he wouldn’t throw it in our direction.  It was meant to be good luck and all, but I was content not to get a bloody nose over it. Finally he threw it in the opposite direction to ours, where a crowd of men wrestled over the coconut until one emerged victorious. The crowd erupted in cheers. As we walked back to the main square I surveyed the crowd, finding that we truly were the only foreigners there. Moreover, we were met with smiles and nods of fascination and appreciation from those around us. It felt special. It felt good. …and it all started with a plate of choila. Do it yourself: That looks a fun (and slightly intimidating) experience! Great photos 🙂 Cool story. What an incredible experience! I’m a fan of the rhyming title. I was wondering if it was a metaphor when I clicked onto it but nope, an actual coconut brawl. It sounds like a great experience. As much as I love doing my touristy things, I also love local experiences where people seem happy that you’re showing more interest in their culture. And, like most good things, it all started with food, glorious food. I didn’t even realize I had rhymed it! I would NOT want to be in that mass of humanity when they try to get that coconut … sounds like a good way to get trampled! I didn’t really want to be down there but found myself unable to escape. Thank goodness the coconut went the other direction! Truly special! This sounds like a great experience, it’s these sorts of adventures which make travel great! Thanks for sharing.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/paragliding-pokhara-nepal/,"Paragliding in Pokhara, Nepal",Nepal,"The wind caught the parachute several times but it just wasn’t the right gust. It fell back to the ground followed by the quick scurry of the paragliding staff to spread it back out for just the right moment, just the right pocket of air to pick it up and take us soaring. Brika, my paragliding guide, was going to get it just right. It was my first time Paragliding.  I had initially come to Nepal for the insanely beautiful trekking, but had heard such good things about the paragliding in Pokhara that I decided to give it a try. Another gust came rushing through and this time, we ran to the edge of the cliff in unison before he shouted, “Okay! Sit down now!” and off we went. I spread my arms like an eagle, surprised at how relaxed it all felt. Looking down at the lake and rice paddies below, I felt incredibly calm, taking in the miniature world below me as if I was a bird taking my time picking out the perfect spot to land.  The other paragliders floated around the mountains around us, colorful and bright like jellyfish in the sky. All around me was the green of the grass and the blue of the sky and lake. Toy cars passed below. I seemed detached with that world below me and one with the sky.  It was beautiful and surreal. But I wanted more. “When you’re not flying tandem, do you lots of tricks?” I asked him. “Yes, sure,” he replied. “Can you do them with me?” I inquired excitedly. “Yes, sure,” he replied again. Taking my GoPro out he snapped a few photos, took a few videos, and continued the smooth sailing for another ten or so minutes. I worried perhaps he hadn’t understood my request, until he tucked the camera between our harnesses and asked, “okay, are you ready for some acrobatics?” “YES YES YES!” I certainly was. He positioned us over the lake, pulled one side of the parachute slightly toward us, and before I knew it, we were spinning. And spinning, and spinning, and spinning.  The wind began rushing past my ears as we created what seemed like our own makeshift wind funnel. The pressure was enough to almost make me black out, yet I still begged him to do it again.  Once more we twirled and twirled our way towards the lake before waving goodbye to the camera and preparing to land. We came in running on the ground, a soft landing and a perfect ending to the past half hour spent flying through the skies.  As if a cue that the timing had been perfect, the sky opened up and the afternoon rain started to fall. I think this might be my introduction to more flying, perhaps in the form of jumping out of a plane next time.  Do it yourself: That looks like so much fun! Paragliding is definitely on my bucket list! It looks like fun..but also a bit scary! I’m guessing you aren’t afraid of heights at all!!! I’m not afraid of heights. I don’t really have any phobias except for cockroaches. MAN I hate those. Oh and feet. That looks so cool. The view must have been amazing. Was surprisingly calming and nice! This looks very cool! I’ve already done skydiving (you really must do that, Kristin – it’s fantastic!!). This is another thing that I’m wanting to do, one day. Along with hang gliding and microlighting. 🙂 I will make it happen before the summer is over. Self promise 🙂 If I lived closer to a place, I would get a skydiving license in a heartbeat. I’ve done tandem 4 times. Paragliding has been on my list for ages. I can’t wait to try it! That looks like a real adventure! Sure it was pretty exciting. Glad to hear you had a soft landing :-). That looks amazing!! This sounds silly but I really didn’t realise quite how high you can go when paragliding haha. Have to do this! I almost didn’t realize until I saw the video footage again. We were way up there! I don’t think so. You can’t really extend because you’re dependent on the wind and gravity plays a factor. I am DEFINITELY doing this!! 🙂 Awesome! That’s what we have in Nepal.loved your blog and thanks for sharing your experience in pokhara. Hi Kristin,You choose the right thing to do in Pokhara. Who make it happened they know “how beautiful Pokhara is?” Because if someone wants to see the beauty of Pokhara. paragliding is one of the right choices.Best seasons for paragliding or visiting Pokhara is spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November) for next visit to Pokhara.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-prepare-for-annapurna-circuit/,How to Prepare for the Annapurna Circuit,Nepal,"I had so many questions prior to starting the Annapurna Circuit trek that I bombarded my poor friends for days with endless inquiries about “what if”s and “but what about”s. Having just finished the trek, I figured it best to jot down every question I had and the answers that made themselves quite clear as the trek progressed.  For anyone considering trekking the Annapurna Circuit (or Base Camp/Sanctuary), the following questions and answers should help you along. When should I go? The most popular months are September and October with the second highest season taking place in March and April.  In the winter months the pass can sometimes be snowed in and in the summer monsoon rains are common. I personally hiked at the end of April/beginning of May and found it to be perfect weather on the circuit and rainy weather on the base camp trek. Do I need to book ahead? About half of the people who hike the Annapurna circuit and sanctuary treks appeared to have a guide and porter, or one of the two.  The cost is typically $16+/day for each and can easily be booked in person once in Kathmandu or Pokhara at any of the many agencies or at your guest house.  Booking ahead online can turn out to be more expensive and really isn’t necessary. That said, the trails are clearly marked, accommodation is easy to find, and since you don’t need camping gear, it’s possible to carry one’s own belongings easily enough.  I elected not to hire a porter nor a guide.  I feared a guide might make too many decisions for me and limit my freedom.  Another blogger also wrote a rant about the low level of professionalism, steering me further away. The NATT guide was a great help and a great free resource I’d recommend printing and bridging along if you plan to go it alone. Plenty of locals along the trail asked if I had a guide or porter, reacting with obvious disappointment when I said that I did not.  I felt badly for most porters, completely laden with incredibly heavy packs, but the locals don’t see it that way – to hire a porter or guide is to provide him with a well-paying job. I was a little torn on this but did buy handicrafts from local women, bought plenty of provisions on the trek, and ate my meals at the teahouses rather than bringing in my own food. I figured this at least helped bring money into the area in some small way. How physically fit do I need to be? Trekking the Annapurna circuit can be made longer and more difficult or shorter and easier, depending on your timetable and interest level in the higher and steeper side treks. If possible, doing some trekking and spending time in higher altitudes prior to beginning is quite beneficial.  Trying a trek for a few days prior to know what you’re capable of – how far you can go each day, what parts of the body hurt and might need more support, and how much weight you can handle carrying – can only help. Most of all, the important thing to remember apart from being injury-free is to have a positive attitude and to honor one’s body.  Don’t push it to the point that you feel defeated or start saying things like “can’t” to yourself.  Your pace is good enough and it’s not a competition. Tips: When you’re hungry, eat something, when you’re thirsty stop and drink water.  Never underestimate how much a 30-second to two-minute break can help.  If you need rest, take a brief one and then keep going. What is accommodation like? The Annapurna circuit and base camp treks are teahouse treks, meaning that there are guesthouses along the way that provide basic accommodation to trekkers (the accommodation becoming more basic as altitude increases) for a very low rate – usually free or just 100 NRP (about $1 USD) per person – with the intention that the trekkers will eat all of their meals at the guesthouse they stay in. The teahouses gain their money from the food they sell at slightly higher prices than found elsewhere in Nepal rather than from the room rates.  Keep this in mind when haggling on rooms. It did bother me a bit when I saw that people brought and cooked all of their own food, yet stayed in the teahouses.  I believe it’s important to buy one’s food along the trail as it lightens the load and puts money in the hands of the local people. Tip: Most teahouses operate on solar power for showers and at the higher elevations, will charge for hot water. Most of the time the water isn’t hot but is more of a lukewarm shower.  Charging electronics also becomes a paid service at higher elevations.  At the lower elevations WiFi is sometimes available for a fee. Get more free travel tips to your inbox! What do I need to bring? Your first major decision is whether to bring quality gear from home or to buy cheap knock offs in Kathmandu or Pokhara. I was coming from 6 months of traveling in Southeast Asia and China and simply didn’t have the gear with me, so I bought knock offs in Kathmandu. I was regretful of this almost from the beginning as a strap on my backpack broke before I even got on the bus to start the trek.  It was the perfect size and fit but the quality was horrible. Throughout the two weeks I used the gear, most of it broke or fell apart in some way.  The same was true for my trekking buddy who had bought her gear in Pokhara. In the future I would definitely buy the same items but would go for the genuine ones as I’ve now learned that quality will far outlast the knock offs and are therefore cheaper in the long run:  What about Permits? You need two kinds of permits — the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) and Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS card) — which will be regularly checked on the trail.  Obtain these in either Kathmandu or Pokhara prior to your trek.  In Kathmandu, the office is about 15-20 minutes walking outside of Thamel.  In Pokhara, it is near the tourist bus station. The process requires 4 passport-sized photos (which can be bought anywhere near the office in both cities), proof of travel insurance (I recommend the World Nomads Adventurer option, which is what I used), a passport copy, and 4,000 NPR (about USD $40).  In Pokhara, it took me less than ten minutes to obtain. Costs I averaged about $25/day at the higher elevations and as low as $10/day at the lower elevations, as the food was cheaper lower down. Click here for more information on how to do the trek independently, how much time to budget, and for a suggested itinerary (plus some stunning photos!) Thanks for mentioning my rant! While I was happy with my decision to not hire a guide every time I saw other trekkers interacting with theirs, I always regarded their porters with envy. That said, it just didn’t feel right to make someone else carry my bags, even if I did pay them (I never let anyone carry my bags to my room in hotels, either). Like you, I figured I made up any monetary loss to the local population by eating all my meals in restaurants (and eating a LOT). Also, thanks for showing me up. I did this trek in 2011 and still haven’t finished writing about it (I’m not even up to Manang!), while you covered the whole thing plus the Basecamp trek in one post…and then wrote another post answering the major questions you had. Who knew we could help people with our blogs… Haha we’ll you’ve been a bit more detailed about each individual town which made it a nice read. Thanks for the help in the planning stages, and for all of your great China posts, too! Very useful information, Kristin! I know I’m going to be asking questions like this, in the future, so this has been very helpful! Thanks, some great information here. Almost feel like getting onto a plane to Nepal but we have our eyes on Arunachal Pradesh this September… Just googled Arunachal Pradesh. WOW it looks stunning! Enjoy and thanks for making me aware of something I didn’t know about previously. Great tips! I love hiking and I would definitely do what you’ve done here. It’s good to know there is a great variety of tea-houses and accommodation options here and I absolutely agree – a good backpack is crucial for this kind of expedition. And it fits within your daily budget goals! Good post, Kristin. I did the base camp early last April, electing that time due to the Rhododendron bloom and it was stunning. The weather also co-operated the full way up and I was able to trek all three days in board shorts. One addenda that I will add to your post: good quality gear does exist in Nepal with plenty of internationally renowned companies having stores in Kathmandu and Pokhara – there’s a huge North Face in Thamel for instance. The rest is pretty bang on though – especially the dilemma about the going without guide or porter. I recall there were stores with good quality gear but if I’m going to spend I usually like to deal hunt online first at home. I find I get better pricing. We found it really hard to find information about the trek too and spent a lot of time agonizing over what we should bring, whether to get a porter/guide, etc., In the end, we decided to do it ourselves and no one seemed to mind our choice to do that, probably because—like you—we spent a fair amount of money while on the trail. We were lucky in that the shop we found to buy our gear in Pokhara turned out to be really very good—we still have some of the things we purchased and overall we were really happy with what we brought with us. EXCEPT we both regretted renting sleeping bags for the trek—they were essentially dead weight as we both found that they managed the miraculous task of actually leeching heat from our bodies, so we wound up not even using them and simply asked for extra blankets anyway. If we had bought them, we would have ditched them as they were completely useless, but since we rented them, we had to carry their extra 5-10lbs for the entire trek instead, cursing them every step of the way… So, I guess if you’re going to bring a sleeping bag, get a good one from home, since the ones you can rent from the shops (even the good ones) are utter garbage. That sounds heavy! The one my friend had was pretty lightweight but she did complain about it until we got to the higher elevations at which point she was happy to have it! Hi Kristin! Thank you so much for your informative post! I’m actually doing the circuit on 18 June, I know it’s monsoon season but it’s the only time I’m able to go, so I’m hoping my lucky stars will follow me and it wouldn’t rain as much.  It’s actually my first time trekking so I’m rather nervous, your posts really did calm me down, thank you so much for that.Just a quick question though, this is an impromptu trip so all I have right now is my pair of Adidas running shoes. Do you reckon it’s good enough for the trip or should I purchase a pair of hiking shoes and break them in as fast as possible? Any help/tips is greatly greatly appreciated.  Thank you!! Cheers,Jovy I just did the trek in my running shoes but I didn’t get much rain until the end at which point my feet were always soaked and in the mud, they weren’t the best. If you can get hiking shoes at home and break them in that would be best. Awesome article great stuff! Hello there, i am doing the EBC this sept. have you been trekking there?  Regards, Dragan Hi Kristin, Thank you for the informative post. I have a doubt about Travel Insurance. I am from India and I would like to know if travel insurance is mandatory? As a matter fact I didn’t even know such thing exist before reading this post. I have been to Nepal once but never carried one. However I will be doing Annapurna Circuit for the first time (without any guide or porter). It would kind of you if you can share some more information about it. Regards,Nihar I heard it was mandatory but they didn’t ask for mine. So, I can’t be sure! Hmm, OK. I will talk with some local travel agents to confirm it. Thanks for reaching me 🙂 Hi Nihar,How was your solo experience with this trek ? I would love to read your adventure if you have posted somewhere. Do provide me the link.I am from India too and planning to do next year without guide and porter but need to start preparing from right now.Thanks how many days did you trek it for? 13 or 14 days but I added on the Annapurna base camp. Without that I suppose it would have been 9. Hello, Kristin. Thank you for the great post it was very helpful for me. I am planning go to trek in mid-March 2015 and your information was exactly what I need. I am sorry for my English 🙂 I am from Russia and now traveling around the World and trying to see great places around the Globe and write some notes about it in my site. Thank you and I glad that find your wonderful site, will be read. Thanks Pavel. I was trying to be as thorough and informative as possible. Enjoy your trek! Thanks for this wonderful post! so helpful for an upcoming trip in april… hope you are enjoying summer in south africa… I live in Durban! Awesome! I love that part of the coast. I will be heading to Nepal in late April this year and want to do this trek but I am wondering what to do with all of my other gear. Did you lock up your regular travel belongings somewhere or carry everything with you? Great blog, I plan to visit often! I left them at the guesthouse I stayed at in Pokhara – the starting and endpoint of the trek. I am not a huge trekker, but if I was going to take on one, it would be Annapurna. Everything I imagine this area of the world to be is summed up in your photos and hopefully that will be me at some point. Funny about the knockoffs, I guess sometimes you do get what you pay for. yeah I got what I paid for! Good enough for two weeks though 🙂 Wonderful information! I’ve been looking forward to this trek for over a year! Unfortunately I injured my back a few months ago and it looks like it’s not healing anytime soon. I’m not worried about walking the trek, but the weight on my back. I know you probably don’t have much experience in this area, however do you think the porter would be able to help this problem? Does the porter carry everything or about half of the gear? Thanks for helping! Hi Sebrin, the porter can carry everything for you. They’re strong! Hey Kristin,  I plan on trekking to Everest Base Camp in October, and would reeeally appreciate if you could answer few questions!! 1) I haven’t been able to find info about being on your cycle while trekking!! I’m not flying into Lukla, so will be trekking for 20-30 days and will definitely get it at some point. I read in one of your SE Asia posts that you recommend a Diva Cup, which I’ve always been scared of, but I suppose I should give it a go. Do you think the Diva Cup would be a manageable solution for trekking? 2) Should I bring hiking poles or buy them there? 3) I have the REI Vagabond Tour Pack, which I’ll be using for my 3+ months in SE Asia afterward, and I guess I’ll have to bring a separate trekking pack, as you gave a link for. Where did you leave your travel pack/ gear while trekking??  Sorry- lots of questions. You have great info. Thanks!Kelly Hi Kelly, 1) Yes, Diva Cup. Fear it not.2) You can buy them there but they won’t be good quality.3) I wouldn’t bring the full 35 liter pack trekking. It’ll be heavy. I left mine at the guesthouse I stayed at the nights before and that’s what pretty much everyone else did too.  Have fun! Amazin Marvelous trip and photo…may I know what camera are you using? I am going to Annapurna this December, and I am thinking of to bring along my DSLR Nikon D1000, but I am not sure if it is advisable. Will it be heavy? Will it able to stand the coldness and is it practical to bring since it will be a more than 5000m hike? I had a friend who brought the Nikon to a place of 3000+m and his lenses was condensed due to the cold weather outside and warm temperature indoor. I want to take very beautiful picture but I do not want to spoil my camera or worse bringing a heavy gadget that did not work. Any advice? I brought my Nikon DLSR with me and used it for my photos. It survived (I didn’t even think about the cold impacting it). I just brought the camera I upgraded to (a sony A6000) to Iceland and also didn’t have a problem. I’d suggest insuring it and bringing it. You bought the camera so that you could use it! I am leaving for this trip in about 3 weeks. I was wondering about vaccinations and immunizations….did you opt to get any shots before leaving? I have been told to get all of my Hepatitis shots but i don’t know if that is really necessary. I can’t replace a doctor’s advice on this but I’d already been on the road for quite some time by then and am always up to date on Hepatitis, Tetanus, and Typhoid. You can get Hep A from contaminated food and it looks pretty nasty. It’s not that expensive of a vaccine and food on the trek is not the freshest. I went vegetarian, actually, because a lot of the food has to be trekked in. Meat. in the sun. No. Thanks Kristin, Answered many questions before my first Trek in March/April 2016.I was going to buy all clothing except boots over there but now I might add buying a good jacket here in Australia before hand……Can’t wait and thanks again. Brendan Same time of year that I went. Yeah, a good jacket would have been worth it but everything else I just had to ditch after since I didn’t have space in my bag. Quality doesn’t matter as much when it only has to last for 2 weeks. Hi Kristin! I am planning to do the hike this March and this is a very informative article 🙂 I was just wondering, did you bring all your belongings with you on the or did you leave some things in hotel somewhere? Did you bring a laptop? Thank you! I left most of my stuff at the guesthouse I stayed at in Pokhara prior to my hike. People do that all the time so they didn’t mind at all! Hi KristinThanks for your post! I’ll be heading to Annapurna in April with my two children…. We’ll see how it goes;-)One thing I can vouch for is the SteriPen. We’ve used it all over the world from the Amazon to Cambodia and I can attest to its efficacy. Water straight from the tap/faucet is sterilized in less than a minute with the SteriPen. Just make sure to use good quality batteries.Inge I didn’t have one when I hiked the circuit and I really wished I had. Waiting for 30 minutes for the pills to sterilize the water is kinda rough when you’re parched! I have one now and it’s the best, plus it’s nice and small Hi. Very nice post. I have done everest base camp trek back in 2010.  I have a few questions regarding annapurna circuit .. We are planning to start on 20 April .  where Should Our Starting Point Be.. We Want The whole  Trek To Be completed in 9-10 days… I would’ve booked my stay in advance, but I’m gonna take my chances without booking teahouses(with fear that they might not be vacant, but still).. You can’t really book the teahouses in advance. You should start in Pokhara with the bus and then take a jeep as far as you can go which should cut out enough days to do it in 10 Hi Kristin, Great to read your tips on Annapurna BC , i am planning on going there early this may, can you give me tips what to bring , how difficult it is & whats needed for paying the guest house and food supply on the route. thanks All of your questions are answered in the post! Thank you so much for this post! We are going to Nepal to trek the Annapurna in a few weeks and this has been so helpful! Enjoy it and let me know how it goes for you! How about going completely solo as a woman? Does that works fairly easy? That’s what I did and I met someone on the bus and hiked with her! There are plenty of people on the trail so you should be able to meet others Im looking at doing this end of november start of december by myself. Ive been to Sumartra and trekked in the jungle for a few days a couple years ago and ive done the able tasman great walk in New Zealand (my home) the start of this year. My only problem is I have a fairly weak ankle. Hasn’t really played up this year. I do have a great support and proper hiking boots. Do you think this will be a big problem? Im guessing i should invest in poles. Would one be easier than two. I hate having to hold to many things.  I doubt I will do base camp. As Im looking at spending time in Chitwan national park as well as im going more for the wildlife than anything. Hey Kathryn, it’s hard for me to tell you that it’ll be fine without being a doctor or knowing your specific situation, but the good thing is you don’t have to carry a tent etc. since it’s a teahouse trek. I definitely rely on hiking poles, and I like to use two because my knees don’t like the downhills. Hi there!! Would you reckon to buy a power charger for the mobile or best to pay to recharge? I also heard that battery may die because of the cold temperatures.. I didn’t have a portable charger back then but I do now, and it comes on every trek with me. You could possibly have the phone die if the temperatures dip below freezing. It’s happened to me before. Batteries in general don’t handle the cold very well. You know I came here expecting to disagree with everything. The opposite is true. I’ll back you up on just about everything above! We did Ammapurna a loooong time ago 1999, this year we were trekking Everest region ( with 2 kids).You don’t need a guide or porter, you don’t need to train,my 50 year old body did absolutely fine as did my son’s 9 year old one, you can carry a pack, you don’t need much gear.Just do it.We all did it in normal street clothes, and a few bits from the back streets of Kathmandu, although in Everest we stopped 2 sleeps before Base Camp as we didn’t have shoes for snow and we’d seen people get into difficulty in Annapurna crossing the Thorong La in chest deep snow,blizzards and running shoes….maybe not so smart. But up to Tangboche monastery, fine, no problem, just a dusting of snow in the morning ( in February).Going back with boots soon, my elder son and I are going to Base Camp, but still, just walking to Tangboche was very much worth it, loads to see up there, plenty of side treks.Simples! Ha, well I’m glad that you agree! Now that I’ve done more treks in my boots in Patagonia I definitely feel they’re way more appropriate for this activity, mainly because they’re waterproof, but I agree you don’t need Gore-tex everything, don’t need a bunch of high-tech gear, and can go on these trails without a guide. You’d have to try to get lost, honestly.  Very cool that you took your 9-year-old. What a neat experience to have at that age, and what a sense of accomplishment for both of you! Hi, I’m planning on doing the Annapurna Circuit in a month and your website has been extremely useful! Just wondering, how long did the aquatabs last you? Is it the same as it is everywhere else? Would you advice me to buy it in my home country or in Nepal? Should I use a steripen instead? Also, have you had any experience with 1. contact lens, 2. the time of the month, and 3. reliable stores to buy gear from there? Is it crazy to not want to bring any gear of my own? I’m planning to rent poles + gaiters + boots there. Hi Ying,Don’t drink the water unless you sterilize it. The tabs are light so just bring a bunch. I bought all of my gear there including the sterilization tabs. The downside of them is the taste and the fact that you have to wait 30 minutes to drink the water after you’ve sterilized it. At higher elevations where there are more yaks and fewer shrubs, it’s best to put in two tabs and wait one hour, so the taste is even worse. A steripen takes a minute, so that’s the advantage.  I don’t wear contacts anymore after getting lasik so no experience, sorry! I did have that time of the month when I was hiking in Patagonia and it SUCKED. However in Nepal at least you’ll have a bed and proper bathrooms. In Patagonia I was just in the wilderness. I recommend a Diva cup instead of tampons because you won’t have to change it as often. The gear will mostly be fake knock offs and I’m not sure if you can rent it, but the poles would be really cheap to buy. Boots I’d suggest getting at home and breaking in before you go. It’s not going to feel very good wearing boots that have been broken in to fit someone else’s feet. I’m planning on visiting Nepal soon so these tips are really helpful – particularly about the perils of buying hiking gear in Pokhara. Amazing posts!! Im planning to do this hike around August this year. This has bee so very very helpful.  Truckload of good karma points coming your way Kristin!  JJ 🙂 🙂 Thanks JJ let me know how it goes for you! Hi Kristin,Was just wondering if you bothered with a down jacket in addition to the NF jacket you had? I’m trying to figure out if it’s worth buying/renting a warm waterproof jacket, or getting a down jacket and rain coat (read other people have done this). I’m already travelling with a thin hoody and a thicker hoody with a fleece lining. I’m travelling to Nepal next week. No I just did the North Face one and thermals Hello, I have a quick question about travel insurance. I was thinking of buying travel insurance from World Nomads for 2 weeks (since that is the  amount of time most people take to complete the trek). Is this a reasonable amount of time? Do the permit authorities require you to have travel insurance for a certain amount of time? Great post by the way! Super informative. Two weeks is reasonable I’d say. They were pretty relaxed with me but that was years ago now. Great blog! Thanks for the info. Based on your inputs will be planning my next trek. Just what I was looking for Kristin! Thanks so much for writing this 🙂As I am getting ready for Nepal later this month, the amount of questions I have does not let me sleep at night! lolMy main worry is if I will be able to carry my luggage with me as I am with a group and not in charge of where or when I will stop and sleep PLUS I don’t want someone to carry my bag either.I will, though, have lunch and dinner and lots of chais in the way for sure. So hopefully will also pay it forward.Thanks again, fantastic find. I would leave the heavy bags in Pokhara at your guesthouse. They’re used to this! Kristan, Great blog. Lot of useful information! I am wondering how many change of clothes does one need to complete the circuit? Are there facilities of getting your clothes washed or washing your cloths along the trek? You would need to hand wash yourself. I did do that twice I think over the two weeks, and had 3 long sleeved shirts and two pairs of leggings. I was pretty gross but so is everyone else. Little point in putting on clean clothes just to sweat within 5 minutes in them again. Thank you very much for putting this little article together! Welcome! Hey Kristin, Thanks for the great post, it was so helpful! You said you did this trek after 6 months in south east Asia. I’m planning to do either this or EBC as part of a 6 month trip around Asia myself. My worry is I’m going to have a heavier pack than I would usually take on a trek like this, as I’ll have packed for the whole 6 months. How did you cope with this?  Many thanks in advance!Beth I left most of my stuff at a guesthouse in Pokhara and just took a small pack with me on the trail. Thanks Kristen, I’m hoping to do the Annapurna  Circuit this March. I’ve previously done trek to Poon Hill, 20 years ago. Now I am approaching 73, I’m concerned about insurance, as World Nomads don’t insure people over 66 years of age. I’m not too worried about my fitness, as I tend to take my time when trekking, as I don’t have to get back by a fixed date. Does anyone out there know of any other insurance company that may give me cover ? Did you look at AIG? Hey!  I am looking into doing this trek coming up in April/May. I was wondering if the teahouses you stayed in had refrigerators? I have type-1 diabetes and need my medication to be at room temperature but safer to be colder than get warm. I know as the elevation increases, the temp will go down but I’m a bit concerned about this. Could you let me know about this? Thanks! I don’t know if they did, honestly. I can’t really answer that for you, I’m sorry! I am currently preparing for my trek in May and your blog post is of such help! Thank you so much!!! I was hoping you could help me out. My fiance and me are going to Nepal in few weeks time and were hoping to complete Annapurna circuit together with base camp trek. Hi Kristi,One thing that I struggle with is the transportation. We want to take bus from Káthmandu right up to Ngadi, another one from Muktinah to Tatopani and at the end Kimche to Pokhara. How did you book the transport? Is it possible to book online or beforehand? Or do we just turn up at each bus station and hope we squeeze into a bus? I would greatly appreciate any advice you could give us. Turn up at the bus station or book ahead in person the day before. I think you’ll see when you get there that most of these places are offline and much of the developing world happens in the moment. Great info and tips! Hope to do it next November. One question, do they sell only replicas or it is possible to buy there the real thing when it comes to trekking stuff (boots, jacket, sleeping bag, etc…)? I think you’ll be fine buying the real thing in Kathmandu or Pokhara as long as you go to the branded North Face or Patagonia stores.  Greats information for our preparation. We plan to do in coming Sep 2019. Hi Kristin,This is th best post I’ve seen about the trail. It’s been really helpful.What currency did you take with you? I have read a lot of stuff and just got massively confused about what is best. Did you exchange while you were there? Or not use the Nepali dollar at all?ThanksSarah I entirely used the Nepalese Rupee, pulling it out of the ATM when I arrived at the airport and in town as needed. Hey Kristin, We would like to do the Anapurna circuit in November. Do we have to book the accommodation in advance? thanksKaya It wasn’t possible to book in advance when I did it. The huts were all first come first served. HiWe are planning a trek to ABC via Poon Hill in May, 2020. Throughout this trip, we would want to book the best available accommodation options. Before contacting any trek organizing company, I am trying to find out the names of the best guesthouses, preferably with attached toilet.  It would be a great help if you can suggest some names for places such as Tikhedhunga, Ulleri, Ghorepani, Tadapani, Sinwa, Chomrong, Deurali, Bamboo, Doban,  ABC, Himalaya, and Jhinu.  CheersIndranil For me, it was just about showing up and getting what was available. I don’t know if that has changed but that was the only way to do it in 2014. What a great blog and I love your photos! I leave for the AC at the end of October and start the trek November 5th. I am 66 and love hiking the Smokies, did the Inca trail two years ago and was in Nepal and Bhutan last November.  I worked in Southern CA for 20 years and miss it so much. Thank you for clarifying the camera issue above. I want good photos but was hesitant to carry. After looking at your photos though, I would not be happy with a phone camera, even though they are pretty good these days. The scenery there is majestic. I was only in Nepal for a few days and hiked to Nargokot. One trip to Nepal is not enough!! Agreed. Have the best time!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-annapurna-circuit-without-a-guide/,The Annapurna Circuit: Too Beautiful to Miss,Nepal,"Somewhere between the baby goats who gingerly sniffed my hand before allowing me to pet them (like puppies do!), the baby cow which did the same, the little snorting yaks, village kids who put their hands together to say “namaste” (hello), the amazingly beautiful mountains that framed every moment, and the daily chai masala teas, it hit me: this is bliss. Ned told me a bit about trekking in Nepal when we climbed Mt. Kinabalu together in Borneo and Laura told me a bit about the Annapurna sanctuary when we trekked Mt. Rinjani together in Indonesia, so it got tacked onto month 20 of my ongoing travels in Asia without much more than a second thought. What I ended up experiencing was some of the most beautiful scenery I’ve ever seen on the longest trek I’ve ever attempted. Not only that, I did it without a guide or porter. I carried all of my own gear (you can find out more about what to bring here), and got my permits on my own by bringing passport-sized photos, travel insurance (required!), and filling out the necessary paperwork. The rest was a slice of heaven. Here’s how you can do it, too: Day one: Everyone starting from Pokhara heads to the tourist bus station to catch the 7am bus to Besisahar, where the trek officially begins (you can also go directly here from Kathmandu on a public bus). Most people take an additional bus or even a Jeep to at least Bhubule or even Ngadi, where the last bus stops (which is what I did). I met Ellen, who would become my trekking buddy for the rest of the trip, on the bus and we made fast friends. Traveling took most of the day and allowed us to fit in about 8km to Ghermu as the sun was setting, where a young girl handed us seabuckhorn berries when we walked into the town.  Everyone there was so friendly, saying “namaste” to us as we passed by.  The guesthouse we chose also happened to brew roxi, a local spirit. This resulted in a few colorful characters stopping by, giving us a laugh and making dinner all that much more interesting.  It was a great way to start what would become a wonderful two weeks.  Ghermu, I love you. Day two: We learned to ask for breakfast a half hour before we actually wanted to eat it when it arrived a half hour late the next morning. The earlier one starts trekking in the morning, the better, as at the lower altitudes it can still be boiling hot outside. We walked the 16km to Karte, which is one town just beyond where most people stop in Tal. Unfortunately much of this trail is along a road that is shared with Jeeps, which churn up a lot of dust. Day three:  This was a long one!  We walked 30 km to Dhukur Pokhani after arriving at Bhratrang at 6pm and finding only two more beds (there were three in our group) at the only tea house in town.  Ellen and I walked an additional hour to the next town just as the sun was setting, which had a good six tea houses to choose from, and plenty of beds! Most people on this day would have stopped in Chame, but it was only 3pm when we arrived there, so we kept going. I’ll always remember this as the first day I ever pet a cow. I recall how a friend of mine wanted so badly to pet one in the rural area of Phang Nga in Vietnam a few months before and how I’d laughed at him, sure he would get kicked or bitten. When the calf sniffed his hand and then dipped his head as if to say, “go ahead,” I was shocked. This time it was Ellen who worked up the bravery to pet the baby calf first, who reacted the same way. I followed suit this time, surprised by how soft and sweet it was. Day four:  There’s a choice of taking the upper or lower Pisang trail on this day. Lower runs along the road and is much easier, while upper involves a steep 600 meter gain but is good for acclimating and is the more beautiful trek by far, offering magnificent views of the Annapurna peaks. Naturally we took the Upper Pisang trail ending in Manang, in the middle of a snowstorm no less, for a total of 20km walking that day. Day five: This was a rest day in Manang to acclimate to the altitude.  This is highly recommended as many people really start to feel the altitude by this point.  Most people take a side trek but I had walked so much the previous days, I didn’t see the need. Day six: We walked the 10km to Letdar, taking a leisure day and waking up at the ripe hour of 7:30am.  At this point in the trek, even if one can physically keep walking, ascending more than 500 meters/day can result in altitude sickness. Even this gain of 660 meters was somewhat ill advised, but we felt alright with it. The night was spent at over 4000 meters. Day seven: We walked the 11 km to High Camp, taking another leisure day and leaving around 8am from Ledtar. The walk to high camp is a steep one, and something I preferred doing in the daylight hours, as many people wake up at 3am to make the trek up from high camp all the way through the pass. Spending the night at high camp was interesting. We luckily arrived early enough (around 12 noon) to get a space in a shared 3-bed room with ice on the walls from the cold. Ellen and I shared a bed while everyone who arrived after us had to sleep in the common room and those who arrived after 3pm were turned away. Day eight: We walked 14km over Thorung Pass to Mukinath.  No lies; today was difficult.  For me, it wasn’t the incline — I’d had plenty of that — it was the altitude.  Thorung La Pass sits at 5416 meters (over 17,700 feet!), and it didn’t matter how much acclimatization I had done, I was feeling it. I felt like my head might explode and each step I took felt as though I was walking on air.  When Ellen came down with similar symptoms after we had already descended quite a bit in the following days, I realized I had been ill that day as well.  That’s a lot to add on top of the difficulty of ascending that much. But when I finally reached the pass, adrenaline took over and I was on cloud nine. Next came a very steep descent. I’ve always been better with uphills than downhills.  My joints are too flexible, as evidenced by a shoulder surgery I had a few years ago.  Downhills are a doozy for my knees. Day nine: Today was a semi-but-not-really-rest-day on the incredibly bumpy and dusty bus from Mukinath to Tatopani (no walking).  It is actually possible to get a bus or Jeep from this part of the trek all the way back to Pokhara, but I didn’t go quite that far. I cut out this part of the trek because I did not want to walk along the road, inhaling dust from busses and jeeps.  I had found it unpleasant during the first days of the trek and didn’t want to experience it anymore. Instead, the plan was to tack on the Annapurna Base Camp/Sanctuary trek since it had taken a much shorter time than anticipated to knock out the circuit. I had read it takes anywhere from 16-21 days, but, at our pace and by eliminating 2-3 by bus at the end, we only took nine! We also added three awesome guys to our group whom we had run into a few times over the course of the circuit trek. Day ten: In order to see Poon Hill, we did the trek from Tatopani to Ghorepani, a steep gain of 1600 meters over 18km.  There were very few flats, downhills (thankfully for my knees), and anything other than steep inclining stone steps. The occasional friendly goat got me through the sweaty, hot day.  It was so endearing to hold my hand under their noses, feel them sniff, then dip their head to let me stroke them.  I vowed to one day have a pet goat.  I’ll also remember this day as the time when I walked up to find Ellen comforting a little boy who had been chased by a rabid cow.  I had heard the screaming as I rounded the corner but had no idea it was due to a 6-year-old running for his life from a cow!  Afterwards I said to Ellen, “can you imagine growing up in a place where you have to fear being chased by cows?” It’s not commonplace in greater Los Angeles, that’s for sure. Day eleven: The Poon Hill trek is done in the early morning in order to catch the sunrise, with most people leaving around 4am. The trek takes 40 minutes to an hour up even more stone steps. Usually the vista is quite impressive, but we had a hazy day so not much was visible. I would complain, but I’ve had unbelievably amazing weather during my travels and still got to see the same mountains from different views, so I sucked it up and kept going. We then made our way to Bamboo via Tadopani to begin the ABC trek. The other side of the mountain brought much greener, wetter, and quite different trekking than the circuit had.  I kept cursing the steep downhill steps followed by equally steep steps up. The final climb down to Bamboo revealed a set my knees just didn’t want to handle anymore. The colorful string of expletives I let off when I encountered them was some of my best work. It’s a pity nobody was around to hear it, as my friends had already made it to the tea house 10 or so minutes earlier. Day twelve: We walked 12 km with a nearly 2000-meter gain to Annapurna Base Camp. Normally this would be completely ill advised due to the altitude gain, but we were already acclimated from Thorung La pass, a good 1200 meters higher, and therefore had no issues. The biggest difference with this trek was the amount of rain encountered. On the circuit we didn’t get any, but come 11am or so on the base camp trail, rains pelted us on the trail and mists rolled in. Day thirteen: Unlike the circuit, the base camp trek goes up and then back down the same path.  We awoke in time for the sunrise, which cleared up and provided some truly beautiful views of the mountains. We then walked 17 km to back to Chomrong, descending over 2100 meters through rain, mud, and another steep set of downward stone steps. Day fourteen: This was the final day.  We walked 12 km to just beyond Kimche where we caught a bus back to Pokhara.  One can continue onwards another few hours or so to finish the trek, but we’d had about enough after 14 days! As for costs, without a guide things become much cheaper and you’re much freer to set your own schedule. I averaged $21/day, though it’s possible to spend less if you don’t have a crippling chai masala tea addiction, which probably added $3-$4 per day to my overall bill.  The busses are also pretty expensive, so if it is all done on foot, you can avoid those costs as well. Both the Annapurna circuit and base camp/sanctuary treks were amazing, and different enough from each other to make it very much worth tacking on base camp at the end of the circuit.  If you have the time, I highly recommend doing both. If I had to choose one over the other, however, I’d go with the circuit. The people, views, and experience were just magical. Click here for the PDF Do you love trekking too? What are some of your favorite treks you’ve done around the world? This is INCREDIBLE!! All your photos…wow… what a beautiful trek. Not sure I could handle 30km in one day though, holy cow. Thanks dear! Yeah, I was lucky that I had a trekking buddy who was very motivating and that we were on the same page, but 30km in one day was certainly a lot and I was walking down the stairs at the tea house that night like an 80-year-old woman! This post made my heart hurt, I want to do this trek so badly. Such a variety of gorgeous sights! Aw thank you, Nikita! What a wonderfully informative post, and breathtaking photos, Kristin! Now I’m determined to do the Annapurna circuit as well as the EBC trek! Which time of year did you do this? Thank you Stephen! Now that I’ve done the Annapurna I definitely want to check out more treks in Nepal. There seem to be endless options! I just did this at the end of April which is the second high season after October. The circuit was fine and we didn’t encounter much rain, but Annapurna base camp was a rainy trek for sure. Hey Kristen,  My wife and I are looking at making this trip.  It sounds like there were some rainy hiking days.  Aside from that was there a lot of traffic on the trail in April.  From everything I’ve read it sounds like Oct.-Nov. are the best months, but a billion people are on the trail then as well.   What are your thoughts? There wasn’t a ton of traffic on the trail in April. It was pleasant to hike for me – no lines or anything. However I’ve heard in the fall sometimes people sleep on the floor in the tea houses because the rooms fill up. It’s the most popular time. Can you go on a shoulder month? The mountains aren’t snowcapped Goliaths like the ones in Asia, but backpacking in the Sierra Nevadas back in Cali is amazing. Going up above tree-line and reaching golden alpine lake basins, such as Bear-Lake Basin in the Ansel Adams wilderness is breathtaking. A far more desolate rocky beauty. No guesthouses, so you have to bring your own tent, sleeping bag, and all other supplies. But since I’m in China, I have summer plans to trek out here. Five weeks going out to remote monasteries in Western Sichuan and southern Qinghai (Yarchen Gar in Baiyu and Ganden & Dana monasteries, both in Nangchen). Finally top the trip off with going circumambulating around Amnye Machen, the second holiest mountain in Tibet (Mt. Kaliash is too deep in the TAR). I’ll be hanging out with monks, nuns, and nomads that most likely can’t speak Chinese, so hopefully I don’t go insane not being able to talk to anyone. These places are way way way off the backpackers, and Chinese tourist’s, too, usual route. By the way, how do you manage with cold weather gear and warm weather gear too? You couldn’t have been lugging all of that stuff the whole time. And after you left the mountains, what did you do with them? That sounds like an amazing trip you have planned! Please do tell me how it goes. I might want to do something similar eventually. Agreed about the Sierra Nevadas – I grew up in California and my love of hiking started there from a young age.  I buy really cheap cold-weather gear. My fake North Face was from Vietnam so I didn’t mind ditching it when I was done. I also am lucky enough to have some friends in London who let me leave my nicer clothing with them for when I return to Europe periodically. Absolutely incredible! I have never been much of treker. but one day hopefully I’d like to accomplish something like this. Do it girl! That is an epic trek! I’d love to climb Mt. Fuji. Wow, just wow! Some truly jaw-dropping pictures here. Am not much of a hiker myself but it’s the promise of scenes like these that take me back to the mountains every time. Thanks for this. Thanks for your kind comment! Glad you like the photos 🙂 This sounds so very do-able!! I’ve never trekked much, but I’ve easily walked upwards of 30kms everyday on all my tips. Your photos are stunning, and Nepal is so easy to get to (I live in Delhi), I think I need to get ready for this one soon!! You should definitely give it a go, then! Thanks for sharing such a wonderful post. Pictures are just awesome. Cheers ! Thank you! Kristin, I’ve done the Annapurna Circuit twice, ABC, Tilicho Lake, Everest Three Passes, EBC, Langtang and Helembru treks. Before they put the road in on the first part of the Annapurna it was truly magical. The road made the villages seem more squalid somehow. If you ever do it again I have to say that trekking from Muktinath to Tatopani is my favorite part. Hardly any traffic, a nice grade, beautiful scenery, and very awesome culturally important villages. Kagbeni is not to be missed! So much to experience on the Kali Gandhaki side. Highly recommended. Love your blog and it always inspires me to travel Thanks, Jim I felt like the road leaving Mukinath is getting bad too. It’s a pity how much the road is completely ruining that trek and the little towns along it. Thanks for the kind words! Kristin, I was engrossed by your photos, especially since it is unlikely (nah,totally not happening) that I will ever see these places for myself. The only more than one day hiking I’ve done was the Milford Track in New Zealand. Beautiful scenery, but no goats to pet, rabid cows nor chai. Thanks so much for the kind words. I definitely want to do some trekking in New Zealand. Such a beautiful place. hi,just wanted to take permission to post your write up on notice board of ACA check post Jomsom.URS is inspirational, and i m local from jomsom Sure! I’ve definitely been in that office! 🙂 such a wonderful post. nice photos too. will be going for ABC at the end of October this year. Thank you! October is meant to be the best time to trek the circuit. April wasn’t bad but we did get pelted with rain and it was MUDDY! Love your post.  I’m planning on doing this trek next month.  Did you find it hard doing it alone?  I’m debating on whether to hire a guide or not.  Any advice would be much appreciated! I met a girl on the bus ride over who I ended up doing the whole thing with. You will meet people along the way at the tea houses. I think it would be fine to go alone. Hi Kristin Nice post as usual, do you find the trek for Annarpurna trek easier to compare to Mount Rinjani?  Need some advice on that since you did rinjani before and I’m considering to take on Annarpurna next year 🙂 This was absolutely BEAUTIFUL! studying civil engineering at an intens level now to prepar for my exmas – but leaving to Annapurna and Nepal in less than a month!!!! cant wait =))))) Any great tips? Definitely! I have all my prep tips here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-prepare-for-annapurna-circuit/ Hi Kristin ,your post is so wonderful  i loved it, thanks to visit my beautiful  country. I am from kagbeni, mustang nepal (now in new york city). Wow you’re from Mustang and now you live in NYC? What a big contrast! Dhanybhad for your comment. I love it when a local reads and appreciates something I’ve written 🙂 First and foremost i just wanted to say i love your articles! But i was just wandering how much do you think it would be to trek Nepal for a month? Ive been trying to plan a trip for the summer of 2016. Do you mean budget-wise? I spent around $15 per day at the lower elevations and a bit more at the higher ones because food becomes more expensive. It’s got to be the cheapest or at least one of the cheapest countries in the world. Hey. Just wanted to let you know your article inspired me to hit up the Annarpurna Circuit without a guide as well. I’m gonna be traveling with a buddy and  we’re also planning on hiking to Everest base-camp. I’d hike up Mt. Everest if I didn’t think I’d get lost and die, haha. Just wanted to say thanks. Looking forward to reading about your adventures. Cheers! Thanks Terry you’re going to love it! Hi Kristin greetings from Madrid,your post has been much more than useful as we are planning a trip to Annapurna but still not quite sure which one to choose.It´s the first comment where someone is doing the Annapurna Circuit combined with the Base Camp and still with some time to reach Poon Hill.Me and my partner only have 10 full days for trekking, (I dont count the day we arrive early in the morning 8:30AM to Kathmandu from our international flight as not sure if that same day we can reach Pokhara or somewhere further on the trek). Considering your diary and the 14 days, do you see any chance to do the same “circuit” skipping or doing by bus/jeep any of the sections and save a couple of days?I know it seems quite challenging, the alternative might be to take out the Poon Hill trek or the ABC portion… Thanks anyway for all the information and keep on! Regards Albert You can take a 4×4 in much farther than we did, thereby cutting out a lot, so yes, if you walk as much as we did per day then you can do it. Hi Kristin, Your photos from the Annapurna Circuit are lovely! We are starting that trek in a few days and your post has made me even more excited. (I will be attempting to make poses at Thorong La as epic as yours.) We had originally thought we would get a guide, but after getting a few quotes in Kathmandu, realized that they didn’t add as much value as we had expected, and that maybe we could manage it ourselves. So it’s always encouraging to read about fellow travelers who have successfully trekked the circuit without a guide. We’ve found planning for this trek to be a bit harder than our usual travel planning, just because most people get a guide so there’s not too much information out there, and we have to cover the itinerary/gear/passes/emergencies/everything ourselves. It was really helpful to read your daily notes to get a sense of what I can expect when we’re up there, which makes me feel better about the whole thing. Just like you, the downhill parts get me the most, so hopefully my trekking poles will help, I will take it slow, and my knees will recover. Thanks for all the helpful info!Julie So glad that you found this post helpful and have a wonderful time! I suppose having a guide helps with sorting out the passes but it’s not too difficult and no, I don’t feel the value-add of a guide is super high on the Annapurna circuit. Hi lovely, May i know which month you went? I planned to go late march to mid april.. but i read that it may be hazy.. Any suggestion? I started in mid-April. The beginning was slightly hazy but once there were no more roads that could accommodate cars or motor bikes it was completely clear and beautiful. Kristin, What is tougher. Rinjani Or Annapurna Circuit?I have done Rinjani, making up my mind for Annapurna circuit. Rinjani is three days and the Annapurna circuit can take up to two weeks so in my mind they’re not even comparable! Thorung La pass is also at over 4k meters so the altitude is a huge battle. It’s tougher for sure, but again I don’t even think they’re in the same ball game. Thanks for sharing your trip, would love to do this before the road construction completely ruins it. What gear (clothing for warm/cold temps) and other did you have to carry? Yeah it’s definitely slowly but surely ruining the beauty. I know it makes life easier on the people who live there but I wonder if they feel good about it, too.  Here’s the info on what to pack: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-prepare-for-annapurna-circuit/ hi! im coming to nepal on july and its possible to hike solo? i only got 10 days there, so any short cut to hike to annapurna? thanks in advance I started it solo but met someone on the bus on my way in. You will meet plenty of people along the way. You can take a Jeep pretty far into the trek and back out so 10 is probably possible if you are willing to hike from sun-up til sun-down, which I did and it was fine. Hi, thanks for sharing your trip. Is it possible to hire porter when one is already in the circuit? My gf and I will like to challenge the trip without a porter but just in case if we don’t have the fitness. Hi, thanks for sharing your experience about ACT..  we are group of friends going to ACT trek in April. we were informed that the quota for ACAP and TIMS permits are over. Do they maintain quotas ? Your inputs will be really  helpful. Thanks in advance I’m not sure why they’d stop – maybe tourism overall declined to Nepal? You probably have to find that out on the ground but it’s not a big deal – you just register the day before if you do want to do it. Thanks so much for this post, Kristin! Wanted to do a Bhutan trek in next month but it is super hard to get to and everything sold out. Anna Purna sounds like an awesome alternative in Nepal! Me and a girlfriend I think are going to try and book! If you ever get down to Cape Town, let me know. Some epic trails here for hiking and adventuring that can point you to! Thanks I will take you up on that! The trek is awesome, and apart from flights you don’t need to book anything before you get there. have fun! thanks for the info.  how much trekking experience /training would you recommend before attempting this trail? what was it like traveling solo from kathmandu? i heard it can be pretty crazy getting out of the city I would definitely train beforehand. You have to take into account that not only is this a 2-week trek, on average, but you will be at altitude. The altitude is what makes it the hardest. I did several day-long treks in the Chinese Himalayas before I went and it helped for sure.  I didn’t have issues getting out of the city. Just get on a bus to Pokhara. Hi Kristin: Great stuff. A couple of questions if you don’t mind. We are planning on going in October and I’m wondering if it is possible and/or worthwhile to book tea houses in advance or can you comfortably wing it? Also, were there any sections of the trail with significant exposure. I trekked in the vicinity of Annapurna 4 many years ago (a bit off the beaten track) and it was a bit dicey in spots. Just wondering how this stacks up. Best, jordy I don’t know if it’s possible to book them in advance. When I was there it wasn’t possible. They don’t really have internet to receive bookings. I’m afraid I’m not sure what you mean by exposure. Do you mean sun exposure? That’ll be the whole trail. Hi, Thanks for this article.  I’m in the learning phase before heading over there next year and your descriptions and the attitude that comes through with your words are great.  I’ve found myself clicking through to your main site and I can tell you’re having an awesome time travelling around – nice one 🙂 We are going to do the same thing this upcoming October.  Your post is super helpful.  One question: did you get your permit at Pokara or Besisahar?  Do you know if it’s difficult to get the permit at Besisahar? I got it in Pokhara. You’re doing it in the reverse? Just an FYI the Manang pass is significantly harder to go up on the other side. It also really sucked going down because it was so steep. I’m not sure about the permitting situation there but there are probably agencies that can help you out, also in Kathmandu. Hi Kristin, Really enjoyed reading about your travels on the Annapurna Circuit. Not that I’m a complete “chicken baby”, I’ve dangled from the wing of a small plane when parachuting, but I’m not crazy a out heights. In spite of this, I’m very intrigued by this trek and wondered how precarious, one false step and your dead, sections this involves. I’m 60 years old and not as sure-footed as in my youth…and I wouldn’t plan on wearing a parachute during the trek?. Thanks,Blaine I didn’t encounter all that many super steep trails. They were pretty wide and picturesque. Hi Kristin I’m really looking forward to going to Nepal and trekking, but I can only make it in the peak of the monsoon season (June/July). Do you know/ have you spoken to anyone about how it could be different or more difficult with the conditions in the summer? Thank you! That’s actually a popular time but you will be wet, just plan on that. I encountered a lot of rain on the sanctuary part of the trek especially, and that was late April. It’s still going to be awesome as long as you prep properly for it. Hi Kristin, where and how you got the permits paper? Thanks There’s an office in Kathmandu and Pokhara. I took a taxi to get there from where I was staying but you could walk Thank you Kristin for such an inspiring blog! I’m planning to trek the Annapurna Circuit and your entry has been extremely informative and helpful. I was wondering if I can hike the trail the way I have it planned. Here is my tentative itinerary: Day 1. Bus from Kathmandu to Ngadi, walk to Ghermu. D2. Karte. D3. Chukar Pokhani and Chame. D4. Upper Pisang Trail to Manang. D5. Side trip to Tilicho Lake. Day 6. Letdar D7. High Camp. D8. Thorung Pass to Mukinath. D9. Bus to Tatopani. D10. Tatopani  to Ghorepani. Day 11. Poon Hill sunrise back to Ghorepani. D12. Birethani D13. Pokhara. If you get a change, I’d love to get your opinion on it. Whether that’s doable. I  am pretty fit and had hiked Kilimanjaro in 6 days. Thank you!!!! All the way from Kathmandu on day one? Start in Pokhara. If you’re really that limited on time consider taking a Jeep farther in than Ghermu. Remember that you have to take altitude acclimatization into consideration and that’s not something you can or should rush. Thank you Kristen for your prompt response! I decided to take your feedback into consideration and adding a couple more days to my trek. Maybe 17 days for the trek will work out better. On another note, how’s trash disposal on the trek. Did you feel the need to carry your trash for the trek or was there a way of disposing things like toilet paper and wet wipes in a somewhat Eco-friendly way? Hi Kristin – love your blog. Very simple question but possibly silly that I keep meaning to ask. When you go on all of these long treks – where do you leave the rest of your things in your backpack not meant for trekking? Do you bring a separate backpack just for trekking and leave your regular backpack at some sort of secure location? HELP! Using your guide to plan my trip starting in Borneo and ending in Nepal. The guesthouses in Pokhara allow you to store your stuff in their storage rooms. That’s been the case in every trekking town I’ve been to. If I’m not using a different backpack for the trek, and need the one that normally has all my stuff in it, I put it in a trash bag, wrap my pacsafe around it, and lock it. Hi Kristin!This is amazing! I’m going to be doing this at the end of March in 2017! I am excited to see that you have done this without a guide! I’m doing this with my boyfriend and we are considering going without a guide/porter. Did you have a guidebook or just a map?  Your pictures are amazing! The trail was super obvious so none of that was necessary 🙂 Brenna, how was the trip in March? My husband and I are going mid/end of March of 2018. Thank you! Hey Kristin,  How gorgeous! Those pictures are to die for. Thank you for this piece.A friend and I are planning the trek for April 2017, but we don’t have 20 days to spare. Do you think it makes sense to do a part of the circuit, say, for about 7 days? We’re not experienced trekkers either, but the beauty of that landscape is irresistible. in 7, no, but you could do the sanctuary trek Hi Kristin, Thanks a lot for all the details you provided in your articles. Great and helpful information.We are going to do the Annapurna circuit in March and I would like to ask a couple of questions. Did you buy a map in advance or in Pokhara?Could you please tell me which map did you use? Thanks a lot in advance.I wish you all the best in your trips. Lisa I got a crappy little map that helped show distances but didn’t provide anything else helpful when I got the ticket, but you don’t really need a map. The trail is well-marked and plenty of other people are hiking it too. This is a very nice and informative post. Even though I am from Nepal, I haven’t done this beautiful trek. Your post has really inspired me to do this trek. As soon as I can get away from Boston, I will do this trek. You have really captured gorgeous photos of the Annapurna. Great post 🙂 Thank you for the kind words! It’s amazing and I hope you enjoy it! Hi KristinPlanning to go to Nepal in March and just had some questions:1. Did you just trek with the stuff you needed, or all of your belongings? I’m traveling through Asia at the moment. Is it easy enough to store belongings with a hotel? I travel with a 40l bag and day pack, is it worth to rent/buy another back pack and store my 40l and day pack? 2. I’m travelling with a laptop and don’t want to trek with it. Were you travelling with your laptop at the time and did your store it? 3. Is it better to buy all clothes in Nepal or before arriving. I only travel with summer clothes. I will be in KL before flying out, maybe I can pick up cheap clothes before flying. 4. Once at the top is the only option to hike back down, are there any jeeps that can take you back down at some point? Sorry for all questions, this is my first time trekking 🙂 Kayleigh Hey Kayleigh!1. I left most of my things in the guesthouse I stayed at in Pokhara. They don’t mind and they’re used to it. I had a computer in there and told the owner it was really important, so he kept it in his room for me, for almost 2 weeks!2. See above3. I bought all of the stuff I needed in Kathmandu except for my fake North Face which I bought in Vietnam for $25 the month before (I was in the Chinese Himalayas before I went to Nepal and it snowed there). It was all complete crap but it lasted me for those two weeks. I think I spent $55 total on everything!4. You’ll need to hike down the steepest part from the top, but Jeeps can take you a long way in and a long way out too. I’ve heard that the roads go farther and farther in each year (which is honestly pretty sad to hear).  Enjoy it! That was my first long-term trek too and it was awesome training because I didn’t have to carry all of the weight with me that I would backpacking and it helped me to build up some serious endurance at that altitude! Thank you Kristin for all the advice. I’m looking forward to it even more!I’m assuming for accommodation it’s a case of turning up early where possible to get somewhere? Exactly, though I usually just walked until dusk because I wanted to get as far as I could each day. Thank you Kristin I really appreciate your advice. Can’t believe I’ll be there in just over 2 weeks ? Hey Kristin,  This is one incredible post, coupled with the questions and answers throughout which has cleared a lot up for me. I’ve got 3 months in Nepal from mid March to early June. Based on those kinda dates, when would you say would be best to do both the Annapurna Circuit and ABC Trek? I’m going to be doing it solo, hoping to meet a few people on the way to tag onto.  Lastly – should I end up doing it alone, are the trails/directions etc. well trodden and so fairly easy to get from place to place? Thanks! George You’ll meet people easily, and I personally went in April and thought it was great. You’ll probably still have snow but a bit less than in March, and it’s not quite as rainy yet as it will be in June. Hi there, Just wondering how difficult it was getting the bus from Muktinath to Tatopani? Are there multiple per day or is it a first in first served kind of deal? Thank you for all the helpful information! Hello! I just wanted to say that your Annapurna guide is awesome. I’m heading up next month and your blog is the most helpful I’ve found. Cheers! Journey well… Wonderful! Thanks! Thank you for the information. I liked your info about not having a guide, the cost, and the fact you stayed in tea houses. Much appreciated. Hi Kristin, awesome blog, thank you so much. The comments have been so helpful too. I am going the circuit in 2 weeks. I said I would meet a friend to start it in pokhara, I fly into kathmandu. Is it best to start the trek in Besisahar/bhulbhule or pokhara? My friend said it starts and finishes in pokhara. I would start in Pokhara. I just bussed there from Kathmandu Very useful blog with panoramic photos during Annapurna circuit trekHope you enjoy a lot ofKeep it up Hii, kristin                Myself Rocky, & ActlyI was searching about annapurna trek then i just found your web page, then i started reading about your travel experience all around the world,itz just awesome, your lifestyle inspires me lot,My dream is just like you ” travel the world” meet new people,know about their culture, bt at the same time life dont always gives you what you want, itz very difficult to survive in this world rather than travel at this time, soooooooo , wish i could be like you someday !! youre living your dream thats the biggest thing, best of luck in the future travel, lots of love from a traveller to a great TRAVELLER Hi, what month did you do this in?  Great photos & stories! Thank you. April 🙂 Hi Kristin,Thank you for the detailed description.Could you please elaborate a little bit on your last day coming down from ABC to Pokhara?Specifically how did you get a ride back and what was the time table of this day? I want to do a similar hike and wanted to know where and when you caught the bus and how long did it take to go to Pokhara. Thank you!Boaz There are busses that leave periodically when full but I doubt there is any timetable. I can’t recall now how many hours it took but that always varies so much by road conditions, traffic, and the driver. Hope that helps! I noticed that you did this trek in 14 days… Do you feel like this was enough time or did you feel rushed? I was told that the circuit would take 14 days but I did both the circuit and sanctuary in 14 days because I did take a bus for part of it. Since I did it, the road has extended even further in, so it is just a matter of if you really want to do it all on foot. I have a very tough time with downhills so I took a bus for part of the downhill. 1. Probably not2. Probably not!3. I think you’ll be miserably cold at altitude without these things. It sucks being that cold without a way to warm up. Think about how much heat you lose through your head! Wow, Kristin, amazing experience to read your 14 days trek in Annapurna region. I like the pictures a lot. Thank you for sharing your story. Hi Kristen,My friend and I are doing this trek in November but we haven’t done any planning yet. The trek companies are charging too much so we thought we could do it by ourselves. Reading your blog makes me feel we could do it. Have a couple of questions for you:1) Did you have issues getting permits and permissions by yourself?2) Was it a problem getting accommodation? They say most tea houses fill up fast if you don’t have an advance reservation, especially since November is peak season.  We are two girls. Would you recommend that we do it by ourselves or hire a guide? Also, do you think I need specialized high mountain hiking boots for this trek. I have regular hiking shoes (not high ankle.)  Thank you Kristin.  Regards,Sukriti Hi Surkriti,1) Not at all. Just bring the required documents and you should be fine. I did it the day before I started my trek.2) Also not a problem, however November is the highest season. I didn’t know it was even possible to book in advance. When I went in 2014 it was all first-come first-serve I did not feel that I needed a guide at any point. I also did the hike in running shoes! Kristin amazing write up. Thank you. Heading there tomorrow. I am also planing to hike on March 2018, But I am alone and not on a budget fro hire a guide for as a companion, so can I join with you? Hi there, Planning a trek in March 2018 for 15 days, not including flying days. This will be my first time trekking with my partner and I had a few questions if you don’t mind!  Is 15 days safely enough time to trek the circuit? I see you did in 14, however, was it ever rushed?If we are running out of time, are jeeps always an option to take the rest of the way?Are the jeeps/busses easy to hitch a ride, or do they only come and go certain times or certain days? Jeeps and buses can take you partway in and partway out. I would not rush acclimatization. That’s a serious thing, so just go at a pace that feels right and if that means you have to drive part of the way out, then so be it. I was going at a pretty fast pace and covering a lot of ground each day – more than the average person was. However I took two full days near the top to acclimate. I am also planing to hike on March 2018, But I am alone and not on a budget fro hire a guide for as a companion, so can I join with you? Hi there,  i’m planning on going trekking through Nepal once i graduate high school this year.  Your website and photos has got me SOOO excited to do this hike and many others in Nepal.  I was just wondering what type of camera you used to take all your photos.  I’m looking for a camera, but don’t want to buy a super big expensive camera as I am not an expert at photography and do not want to carry a large bulky camera up and down tones of mountains. Sounds awesome Savannah! That was a Nikon that they don’t make anymore and it was a bit heavy. These days I wholeheartedly recommend the Sony a6000. I think it’s fantastic for the weight, the value, and the photos it takes. Plus it has so many features. I wrote about it all here:  https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-camera-2017/ Thank you for this guide!  I just got back from the Annapurna Circuit, and your guide was very useful!  We went from Chame to Birethanti in 14 days (with a crazy 4 hour bus ride from Jomsom to Tatopani).  I don’t know how you covered some of the distances you covered in that time, nice job!   You said you went to “Bamboo via Tadopani to begin the ABC trek.” I think you meant “Tadapani”. Glad to hear it worked out well for you, Jason! Thanks for the correction. Hi Kristin,I chanced on your website and immediately was drawn in by by your writings and photographs. You exude a streak of joy and curiosity as a traveler. I could share many of your sentiments and your photos bring me warmth and certain intimacy as I too experienced similar journey.I am also a solo traveler and enjoy taking photos. My first trekking Mt. Kinabalu 10 years ago gave me confidence and motivated me to more trekking and backpacking.I went on Annapurna Circuit on November 2010 with a group of friends (salute to you for doing without a guide!). I like your jumping poses on the summit snow! Strange, we didn’t have snow on the spot. Thanks and regards,CY Tan I want to do it but I am my friends not interested to hike. So is there any one going on march/2018 and can I join you? I’m planning on it! Woah! loved reading every bit of it.. I so wanna go right now Love reading about your trip! Did you find any guide books that were helpful in planning this adventure? I never read them honestly. The trail is very clear so you should be fine 🙂 Wow, Kristin, I love your blog. You are an inspiration to many. I started last year, at age 66, to fulfill my bucket list of traveling the world solo on my small government pension. Living frugally, I was able to visit the UK, DK, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, France, Spain, and Portugal over a period of 7 months. I also walked 310 km of the Camino Frances through Spain. My goal is to visit all 194 countries that will let me enter, visit or hike to the highest and lowest elevations, visit some of the major UNESCO sites, and volunteer a bit of time in each country leaving it a little better than when I arrived.This fall I’m starting in Nepal for 2 months, then visiting south Asia, and ending with 2 months in Pakistan.I’m curious as to what you carried in your backpack. I read the link to what you took but there was no mention of anything besides a basic change of clothes, running shoes,  a water bottle & purifier.Did you not take anything else? You took your phone &/ or camera? What about a medicine kit? Did you or others get any blisters on your trek ?  What toiletries did you take? Sunscreen?Thank your for your great blog. Love your pictures! Amazing! I took my camera and my phone, yes. I didn’t get blisters, luckily. Sunscreen yes. Incredible story Kristin! I’m thinking of doing the same in October and i’m also going solo but i’m not that much of an experienced trekker, I am in shape though. Was the altitude that much of a problem? Did you find places to buy food along the way or did you bring everything from Pokhara? Any more recommendations for someone who wants to go at it solo? The teahouses all serve food so no need to bring your own. Usually you negotiate your room rate based on eating your breakfast and dinner at the teahouse. Altitude doesn’t really have to do with fitness, honestly. Take your time acclimating and honor your body, that’s my best advice. This was my first multi day trek too! Amazing post…. Much inspired, already feeling confident. Had been searching over internet for stories of trekking in nepal by yourself.. without a guide… Your experience took me there … Thanks for sharing it… Cheers!Subcribed you 🙂 Awesome so glad you found what you needed! Finally am heading to nepal next month, got my leave and a booked my tickets. 🙂 Read this one for the 4-5th time again.. Made my itinerary with the help of this one 🙂 Read many blogs but so far this has been the best! .. Also got that reward from booking cuz of you! Hope some day i could travel as crazy as you! Awesome! LMK how it goes for you! Going myself later this year… can’t wait! Maybe a stupid question, but how did you know which way to go without a guide?  Super informative! Thanks! The trail was pretty easy to follow and if you’re not sure, just wait a second until someone comes along the trail. It’s popular enough that you can always fall back on that plan 🙂 Hi Kristin, thanks for the guide – really useful I just wondered what time of year you did the Annapurna trek? Thanks April 🙂 Amazing kristin ! After reading this, i feel i must go by my own now to explore as earlier i was planning to go with a package trek.The pictures are beautiful. Oh good have fun! Can you please tell me about the total cost or the budget of the whole trek if I am solo travelling. I’d budget an average of $20 per day. I’ve read in some blogs that we can start the trek from chame or manang so as to save time and money, those blog mentioned that till besisahar we can come on a local bus and from there to manang/chame we could get a sharing jeep? is this trure? At the time that I wrote this it wasn’t possible to take a jeep all the way to Manang (You’d be cutting out almost all of the trek) but it was possible to get to Chame. I didn’t because I wanted to hike it. I have heard that the road has extended further into the trail each year so I suppose it’s possible now! Hi Kristin,  I Have a doubt may be you could help me out here 🙂  I have made my trip Itinerary for Thorong La pass trek based on your blog, will be starting on the 15-16th October. (Damn excited for it )  While am also reading about Thorung Peak (6144m), I was wondering if it is possible to join a group at base camp and then may be head for the Thorung peak with them. Am pretty confident I don’t need a guide up till the Thorung La (5416m) Any leads / advice / facts / warnings you would like to give ?  Do you know of someone who’s done Thorung Peak?  Namaste from Mumbai 🙂~Tushar Hi Tushar, I think normally you’d need to have the guide from the beginning, but you won’t be alone on the trail, and will have plenty of opportunities to meet others and join groups you find along the way just by being social and walking together. That would be my best advice. Hi Kristin! Love love love your blog! I’m going solo for the month of November. Did you do tilicho lake while you were there? Also – shoes… what did you wear? I’m an avid trail runner and a big part of me wants to stick with what I know – RUNNING SHOES! But, I don’t know if that’s advisable. I noticed your shoes and figured I had to ask! Looking forward to hearing from you. ~Alex I did it in running shoes and everyone looked at me like I was insane, but they worked for me! It’s a trail so it’s not like you’re walking on glacier moraine or anything rocky. I did not go to Tilicho lake as I heard it was icy at the time and that made it a bit dangerous. Wow! such a amazing and interesting post. Thanks for providing wonderful pictures and information.  Hi Kristin, This is great!  I am planning to do the Annapurna circuit without a guide, too.  Have you, by any chance, ever been refused to any of the camps because you don’t have a reservation?  What are the other options in cases like these?  Thank you very much. They didn’t even take reservations when I went. There wasn’t internet for that. I’m guessing some are still like that. Most towns had multiple places to stay, although at base camp people had to start sleeping on the floor of the common area and once that was full they had to turn people back down the mountain. I would try not to leave it until it’s almost dark to find a place. Pace yourself accordingly. Hi Kristin, having just done the circuit a week back, I thought it might be an idea to post my experience and where I’d differ from yours. I only did half of the actual circuit on foot due to time constraints and concerns for my funds which in retropsect I needn’t have worried about, but hey… Running shoes?! Insane!! It worked for you but in general I’d suggest avoid them. Sure, sections of the trail are simply dirt track, but you’ll also encounter rough, rock strewn terrain that could easily twist an ankle and sharp rocks which will tire out feet with not enough of a sole to protect them. Ankle support is essential in my view and I was particularly grateful as with tired legs I approached Tal, misstepped and overshot with the other foot and penalty kicked a boulder that had no intention of moving after several thousand years. Painful with boots, certain injury without. Remember, it’s your legs and feet getting you anywhere so treat them with respect. An avoidable twisted ankle puts an end to your dream trek! As I say, I only took eleven days actual trekking, jumping on buses mostly for the descent to Pokhara, which I now wish I’d been more selective with. It’s difficult when you have no idea of what’s ahead but certainly the ride from the town Besisahar to Ghermu was a missed opportunity to enjoy a walk through low land forest and villages along the way. Heading out the village of Ghermu, you’re first navigational dilemma as the road forks but quickly resolved by guy passing on a motorbike and where you are introduced to your ‘Polish guide’, a quick dash of red and white paint which will keep you on thre trail. There were a couple of times it provided really useful, where I’d turned the wrong way. You’re walking through a valley floor so the river is always your guide roaring away generally to your left, though you’ll bre crossing bridges time and again.  On food. Someone asked about trail mix! You wish. You’ll be surviving on rice, eggs and whatever variant can be gleamed from them. Here, ladies and gentlemen your diet plan begins. Overweight when you start? You wont be when you’ve finished! Hankering ater a Snickers bar? You can get them but realise the effort involved in getting Western treats up the mountain and be prepared to pay more for the luxury. As for eating your own food… don’t. It comes across as an insult to locals who rely on cooking you meals to make a living. You think a room at $1/5 is something they can survive on? And whatever you do do not do as I saw, two young Israelis asking for raw food to cook their own meals. So lacking in empathy for those who are poor by comparision to the guy standing there with his ultra lighntweight cooking pan and stove. Sorry guys, you really did embarrass yuorselves with that one. Clothing. I didn’t spend anything near what I’d planned having looked at all the fancy gear online prior to leaving. I picked up an Alpha Industries down jacket off eBay for$50 and it got me over the pass in arctic winds absolutely fine. I already had a cheap pair of baggy fleece lined trousers and the army mitts I took only became necessary when I started using my trekking poles. Sleeping bag. Again, I picked up a cheap down, three season affair in a sale at $65, along with a silk liner I already owned and it worked fine. The down is lighter and packs down small so bearing in mind you’ll always have at least another blanket from wherever you stay to cover you and even at high camp where the evenings really do plummet temperature wise, I never felt less than warm. As for the poles.  Many use them throughout the trek, but because I was initially having to carry my bulky down jacket I didn’t have the opton, but then found I didn’t feel I really needed them. Where they become essential is on the trek to base and high camp, which is steep and if only so you can hang off them grasping for air which isn’t there! For me they come into their own on a descent and it’s a long one after the pass and where it’s very easy to pick up too much speed and risk injury. The poles worked as a brake on momentum on several occasions. The thing to know about poles is they add 25% energy consumption to your activity as you’re using sholuders and arms to work along with legs, so make sure you add that to whatever you’re eating to get you through the day.  Altitude. Treat it with respect. I’ve suffered from AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) on two previous occasions and it’s something to avoid. Doing the circuit alone was my way of ensuring I stayed within my physical abilities (I’m 59) and didn’t let peer pressure become an issue. Don’t allow yourself to just go along with a headache so as to not let the group down, it’ll get worse and you only have to stay where you are to allow it to pass before moving on. HAPE (High altitude pulmonary oedema) and High altitude cerebral oedema (HACE) is something else and you need to descend immediately. On this occasion I took Zolamide as a precautonary high altitude medicine and I suffered no ill effects whatsoever. I moved slower than anyone else around me, partly because I had the wrong pace! I didn’t figure this  out until I hit high camp and realised my zip/dash of twenty five paces, then struggle for air was completely inappropriate and had to switch to the shuffle gait of those passing me or I’d have never gotten to the top. Being slower, I arrived on my own and there is something to be said for being with others as it starts to get a little scary when you realise how thin the air is and how vunerable you are to the cold. As an example I put up the hood on my jacket to avoid the pain of the wind shooting past my ears, only to instantly regret it as in doing so I somehow had reduced my ability to take in what little air there was and in a panic struggled with mitts to pull the hood off again. I was very close to probably blacking out which on my own could have become something much more serious.    Tough? It’s manageable until you hit base camp and you see the sheer climb ahead of you which requires a good mental talking to to get you up there. I nearly talked myself out of it at that point and certainly there were some who turned back. But the trick is to step onto the route and so can no longer see the entirety of it and take it step by small step, you’ll get there eventually. It’s not a race or competition, though I was a little disappointed not to meet up with the informal family of trekkers that become your ‘team’ in Muktinath on the first town post descent. I lost a good hour after I walked past the summit, not seeing the usual sign of congraulations as it was buired beneath prayer flags; carried on past, puzzled why I was suddenly heading down so quickly, with my altitude watch still telling me I had another 200m ahead (my watch had been accurate up to this point. But as it’s dependant on air pressure for accuracy, a daily calibration becomes more crucial). After a good hundred meters down I realised something wasn’t right so dumped my rucksack by the trail and resented every step of the climb back to the highest ‘restaurant and hotel’ in the world, an almost pitch black tearoom shed, where the guy running it spends six months living and sleeping off a couple planks of wood laid across the counter (That’s also your ‘hotel’!). Having realised my mistake he helped me get the obigatory ‘I was here’ shot, then I joined him with his mate for a big cup of black tea in celebration. As for the trek down, I now regret taking the bus all the way to Pokhara bu certainly certain sections you’d not want to walk for the huge billows of dust that will be thrown at you by the numerous buses, bokes and roadworks that pass your way. Where the old trail is still in operation, your ‘polish’ guide will direct you but there are sections of road whixh are just a bleak enterprise.  So, I did it! Enjoy your adventure. It’s one to saviour. I laughed more than a few times in your post, especially the ‘penalty kicked a boulder that had no intention of moving after several thousand years’ part. Thanks so much for sharing your experience here with such detail. I’m sure that many readers will find it helpful! Hi Kristin –  I loved reading your blog.  I am leaving on Mon to do the AC and it was SUPER helpful.  Quick question – what time did you normally start hiking in the morning? We would wake up around sunrise and eat breakfast and get going. The earlier the better I think. It gives you the flexibility to get farther or stop earlier. We’d go to bed pretty early too – it’s not like there’s much nightlife or things to do after dark, ya know? Have fun! Perfect – thank you for the info!  I had figured that based on other treks but great to confirm!Rachel Really useful artice!!! Thanks for sharing such amazing content.   The trekking to Annapurna Circuit is one of my favorites, it’s such a helpful ultimate guide for all planning to go Annapurna Circuit trek. Also, one of my other favorite of this route is Manang Trek. If you have less time, then visit Manang only. I am sure that you will love it. Great reading Kristin – Some mates and I are arranging now to do this at the end of March next year.Was the Thorong Pass the only real area where altitude sickness kicked in? did you take anything for it or just battled through feeling like crap? Hey Mike, altitude could be problematic from way farther down, just depending on the person. The best thing you can do is give yourself time to acclimate if you need it. You can take medication for it but that will mask symptoms, not actually make anything go away. It also dehydrates you and makes you more susceptible to sunburn. I’ve never taken anything because I want my body to be able to communicate with me. Basically, if you’re truly sick you just need to descend. Hi KristinI am so happy to find someone, who has done it without a guide, i feel more confident now to go alone.i was thinking to do it very slowly, walking less km per day then yourself, as i am afraid i am not so physical strong,is there places to sleep every 10 km roughly.i would be so afraid to arrive after 20km and there is no bed, i think i would die,but still i really want to do it. You can take a look at the map and see where each town is so that you can plan it out. You won’t have to set out for the day without a plan. Hello! I just wanted to say that your Annapurna guide is awesome. The way you have explored the article is so readable. I’m heading up next month and your blog is the most helpful I’ve found. Cheers !!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-female-travel-dangerous/,The First Time I Felt in Danger Traveling as a Solo Female,Nepal,"As we bumped along in the car on the first night in Sri Lanka, the driver weaving in and out of oncoming traffic, my friend smiled to me from the front seat and said, “I missed this chaos.”  Walking along the street several months later in the Thamel area of Kathmandu, Nepal, I thought of the way he had said that, leaning to speak to me as the car waded through the dark on the bumpy and rocky road.  I remembered how much I agreed with him then and how much I agreed again now, as rickshaw drivers rode by on their bicycles, taxis narrowly avoided clipping people walking on the street, motorbikes weaved and zoomed through, and shopkeepers leaned from doorways and stoops to say, “namaste”(hello). I had missed the chaos, and Kathmandu brought it right back, front and center, to my present. A few days later I found myself in the lakeside town of Pokhara in Nepal, about ready to start my two-week trek in the Annapurna mountain range. The daily scheduled power outage had blackened the side streets where all of the guesthouses, schools, and residential buildings sit.  I thought it strange that instead of scheduling the power outage for daylight hours, it was going to run from 7pm until 1am, the exact hours when people need light the most. I was used to the scheduled power outages in Kathmandu, but there was so much hustle and bustle on those streets, it wasn’t all that noticable. In Pokhara, however, the small side streets were pitch black by 7pm. Nevertheless, I was thirsty and needed to buy some water.  My only option was to walk to the market down the street, which I didn’t suspect would cause any issues. I was wrong about that.  Incredibly wrong.  I walked along enjoying the warm night, when I suddenly felt a hard, aggressive squeeze on my breast.  I screamed in a mixture of pain and surprise as my brain processed what was happening.  I turned just in time to see the coward running away back into the darkness. I always figured I’d be quicker in a situation like that. Even with self-defense knowledge, a pretty good right hook, and a very confrontational attitude when the time calls for it, I was left completely victimized, helpless to do anything. It was all over before I had a chance to react. I kept asking myself, “Why didn’t I run after him? Why don’t I have a light, or a weapon, or something?” But in reality, one little light bulb in my hand wouldn’t have done anything and running after him might have led to even more danger.  The encounter left me too stunned.  I wasn’t prepared for it because who walks around expecting to be groped? I marched straight to the tourist police after regaining composure.  They asked if I had any friends in Nepal who could walk me back to the guesthouse.  I said I was alone. Their response? You shouldn’t be traveling alone.  It took me demanding an escort back to my guesthouse, via a passerby who had to serve as translator (at the tourist police, yes, the tourist police), in order for the officer to lazily stand up out of his chair and lumber after me. I scanned the perimeters of the dark street for the groper on the way back, but, of course he had hidden himself from view.  I didn’t know what his face looked like anyways – just the back of his striped green and blue polo shirt. That night, I was pretty upset. I posted about the situation on my Facebook Fan page and got some messages advising I leave Nepal, but that wasn’t in the cards. I had gone there to tackle the Annapurna circuit and I wasn’t going to leave until I had successfully completed the trek. In the days that followed a combination of little kids handing me berries and flowers along the trail, local men and women from the mountain minority tribes kindly having conversations with me and cooking me amazing food, petting baby goats and cows, and falling in love with the impossibly beautiful Himalayas slowly but surely brought peace back to me. I returned to Pokhara two weeks later and went paragliding, sat in a shop full of prayer beads with the owner who gave me chai and told me all about how he made the bracelets, went to a local momo (Nepali-style dumplings) joint where in between freshly making food, the owner gave me a plate of off-the-menu buffalo meat and pounded rice, and I even joined a local celebration where I was welcomed warmly. Eventually the groper faded to a distant memory, but I’ll never forget the lesson it taught me. This world is still the kind of place to think twice about, unfortunately, for women.  Safety isn’t a given. Also, I broke my own rule. I walked alone at night in the dark. I won’t make that mistake again. Read 31 safety tips from solo female travelers here.  However, I’ve said before that you can’t judge a country from one bad egg or an isolated negative experience. There are good and bad people everywhere in this world, including where I’m from! That said, I always tell the whole truth about the places I visit, and I couldn’t write about my entire experience in Nepal without mentioning it. As I walked in Kathmandu during my last days in Nepal, having just visited the local-loved, street side, 30-cent lassi maker I dubbed, “lassi man”, dodging traffic as I walked, saying “namaste” to the shop owners in their doorways, and sporting a necklace given to me by the chai man in Pokhara, I said to myself: “I’m going to miss this chaos”  Have you ever had a change of heart about a place you initially didn’t love or were unsure about? Have you ever felt in danger while traveling? I have made it through the whole of your blog in 2 weeks. It has been an absolutely incredible read and I look forward to the next instalment. What you experienced here is one of the things I fear about visiting places I have never frequented/travelled to, not knowing the surroundings, the people, the culture. But after reading this I get a sense that those are the things that attract you back to such places and take away the thoughts of bad things that happen. It is great to read of someone enjoying the world so much. That’s such a kind comment, Martin. I really appreciate it and I’m glad you’ve been engaged enough to read the whole thing! I hope you’ll be fearless in traveling in the future – it’s easier than it seems! Thanks again, you made my day. Wow, pretty freakin’ random and absolutely jarring I’m sure. It seems things happen when you least expect and also when you are most comfortable. I think because of the randomness, quickness, and also not being more aware probably caused it to be so shocking — besides that it was a perverted sexual assault.  It takes a few seconds at least for your brain to process exactly what happened and by then he was gone. But, as I had reported (non-sexual assault) problems to tourist police in Thailand a couple times, they tend to be pretty damn lazy. Especially about taking action of any sort. But glad your outlook remained high and an awesome experience followed! I think when it comes down to it, police don’t typically help that much, in any country I’ve needed them in. Oh well, glad that it didn’t happen twice and that I had a chance to give Nepal another shake. Is India still on your wish list of places to go? Or did this incident make you throw out all plans, no matter how concrete they were, out the window? India is even more firmly on my list than it was before, after having visited both Nepal and Sri Lanka. I have been told enough times not to go there alone, though. Although I have met girls who have done just that. I think it would be great to start off with a travel buddy and if I feel confident enough handling it solo, I will. I just recently found your blog and I am enjoying every article of it!I am native Latvian living in India since 10 months by now.  Before moving here I was concerned about safety, food, dirt, heat, culture..- everything! And still I decided to come here.India is wonderful! Diverse, challenging and incredible!I suggest you to explore the South of India, as  the part of country below Goa is much safer than North part. People are kind and helpful, they are curious, but they do not bother you with naughty looks and comments, as it may (will!) happen in the North, especially Delhi and Punjab.Goa with its beaches, Hampi with its history, Kerala with its tea plantations and backwaters..and Mumbai – with its mess, dirt, smell, street-food and Bollywood! 🙂 Merry Christmas to you! 🙂 Thanks for your comment. I hear all these horrible things about India but I still want to go, and I know plenty of women who have traveled there solo and while they’re totally badass and brave, I think maybe I am too. I love small towns. They’re always better, aren’t they? Kristin… everyone walking on Indian streets is not a rapist. Some stories get blown out of proportion. And in most cases, the trouble is self-inflicted by Western women when they go and drink with guides and drivers in secluded places. They must understand the local culture at lower level. Indians are known for their warm hospitality. Then another issues is that most women from the West don’t understand that they must dress up suitably and not roam around in scanty clothes. The subject needs lots of time and space to be discussed. India is NOT that unsafe as its predicted. First of all this is Nepal. I’ll also point out that I was sober, just going out to buy water, and was dressed appropriately. Surprise AND disappointment — of all the countries I wouldn´t expect something like that to happen in Nepal. In general, they do not have many cases of locals vs. tourists incidents, I think. Or maybe it´s just my naive idea.. Nepal — home to the humble and smiley people.. Everyone was surprised and my guesthouse owner said it was the first time it had happened, but still, it happened. yes its rare and yes it happened. its very rare and better be careful, otherwise you would never regret. you have to be careful in every county u visit… as you mentioned one bad egg shouldnt be a case to judge a country… I’m so sorry to hear this happened to you. Incidences like this can be a really shocking reminder that these things can happen anywhere. I lived in South America for 9 months and you get so used to life that you forget to be aware. While I like to believe every country has bad eggs (North America, too!), the risk is higher in certain countries. I definitely experienced some space violations when I started getting cocky and thinking, “I’m basically a resident, I don’t need to be cautious anymore”… Your travels are amazing, I love your blog and you’ve inspired me to travel solo. I’ve only done a bit, and it was almost always positive. I’m headed to Korea for a year and can’t wait to see Asia like you have! – Meaghan Aw Thanks so much Meaghan. Enjoy Korea! I’m sure you’ll meet all kinds of amazing and trustworthy people. I’m really glad you stayed and did not listen to people saying you should leave. What sort of advice is that? One short and upsetting experience and you are supposed to throw your hands up in the air and run away with your tail between your legs? How would you ever do anything in life? How would you ever achieve anything if that was how you dealt with issues and problems? If that was how you reacted when thing went wrong? I’m glad you stayed and experienced the rest of the amazing country. Nepal sounds amazing. I was groped once in Egypt at the market and the f**ker ran away before I could thump him one. I felt stupid because I had seen his hand come up a split second before he did it, and I knew what he was going to do. I couldn’t react quickly enough either. They are cowards, pure and simple. I hope their hands fall off. I’m so sorry to hear you were groped! I think neither of us should beat ourselves up. They’re disrespectful men and unfortunately this world is full of them. You can’t always react with a second’s notice. Just like you say, there are bad eggs everywhere. My group of girlfriends and I were flashed by a creeper in a trench coat on the Paris metro. We were just 17 at the time and that encounter has stayed with me for quite some time. But it didn’t make me love Paris any less 🙂 That’s probably pretty rattling at 17! What a creeper! Glad you were able to still enjoy Paris, though. Kristin, I am so sorry this happened to you, and glad you persevered and got a better, more positive look at the country.  YEARS ago when I was a sophomore in college in a small US town, I was walking back to campus from the town itself in the late afternoon (it wasn’t dark, and the street was not deserted), when a boy who was probably in high school came up to me and put one fist between my breasts.  I was so shocked I couldn’t say or do anything. He ran away after doing this.  I never even reported it – this was in the 1960’s, and I think in those days we didn’t realize this sort of behavior could be reported.I have just signed up to receive your monthly newsletter. Have loved what I have read in the posts I’ve gone through following the link from Nomadic Matt. I admire you and young people like you for traveling so boldly and easily.  Keep it up, and also the good writing! Thank you Susan. I do realize this kind of thing can happen back home too, and maybe it’s even worse, which is just disgusting. Luckily we were both safe and nothing truly horrible happened. Glad to have your readership! I am glad that is the worst thing that ever happened! Not to downplay it but it could have been so much worse a story for the “worst thing!” I have traveled alone in Europe and felt safe and I am going to Asia with my sister in April so I am preparing. Nepal is one destination we will be going to. I am enjoying your writings very much! We are also going to India if you want to join us! Thanks for the invite! I don’t have plans to do India – well honestly I have no plans at all past next week – but it should be a great trip. Enjoy! The locals in Pokhara were pretty shocked too. They obviously don’t have that happen often, which is a good thing. I still really liked Nepal 🙂 I loved my stay in Nepal, for so many reasons. The people mainly, the landscapes. The food. Have so many great memories… Meeting a bunch of young people in a bar in Kathmandu, they sharing their shisha, momos with me, asking each other questions about our life. Nepalese people are very curious. Starting a conversation with a teenage because he was playing his guitar in a front door, in Pokhara, he was playing a Jack Johnson’s song. He invited me to get in, to a store. My first guess was “oh now he is going to try to sell me something”. But I was wrong. He took me inside to give me a private guitar recital. He was very good. Whenever I listen now Guns & Roses or Jack Johnson, it remains me of Pokhara… I remember how dark the streets could get there, now that you mentioned it, After some beers, getting back to my hotel, getting in to some weird places, well, a funny experience… And considering my size and height to Nepalese standards, I was not really concerned about wandering by night… Regarding your situation, I agree with you. It is stupid to judge one country by one person. In your case, can you tell this stupid man was from Nepal?… Cowards like him, those do not have nationality.Enjoy Berlin!… Ich Liebe Deutshcland 😀 I had some really nice experiences in Nepal as well. Someone was playing guitar when I was eating mo mos once at a local joint. Maybe it was the same person 🙂 Kristin you are so brave! Good on you for sharing your story and bringing light on these horrible situations, I hope the rest of your travels have been safer! <3 Thank you so much, Cherise. The rest have been good! I just sold most of my belongings except at my business and am headed out to do the same in April! I have a friend in Nepal and am heading there first! Thanks for making this easier for me, knowing I am not the first brave soul! I’m sure you’ll have a wonderful time in Nepal and good for you taking that step! Something similar happened to me in India…I was so in shock that I had allowed it to happen and I didn’t even tell my boyfriend about it until afterwards. It’s so easy for us all to say what we should have done (I should have hit that guy or screamed at him) But the reality is far different.I still think about it this day and feel ashamed that I didn’t stand up for myself more.But live and learn right? Please don’t feel ashamed. We always think we’re going to be heroes but then emotions, hormones, and chemicals we can’t control come over us in these situations and paralyze us. It’s really only through experience and training that people tend to fight back effectively in these situations and sadly, we might both be better equipped now. I won’t let it make me feel weak though and I hope it doesn’t make you feel weak either! oh come on, just a boob press, not like you got raped. Buggy, you’re so right. What right do I have to feel violated? It was just someone deciding to exercise his power and influence over me by cowardly violating me in the dark and then running away. What in the world is wrong with that?!  I can’t believe I had it wrong this whole time. The only situation where I’m able to feel violated or upset about is rape? Thanks for setting me straight. I’ll be sure to pass along that information to anyone who has ever been fondled, kissed, coerced into something s/he didn’t want to do, or stalked.  Next time, though, since you’re so wise, it would be great if YOU had the courage to leave your real name, and a real email address. Just so that we can all tell you how right you are. You know, just a few years ago I would have agreed with you.  Maybe just an year ago. I know several women who have been raped, so I always thought that the men who grabbed me on the street  when I was a teen weren’t a big deal, and that I shouldn’t make a fuss about it… Until I realized, just recently, that I’m too scared to wear even a modest dress when I’m without my boyfriend, that I’m afraid to let my hair down, that I always monitor where might the next attack come from.  So even if this is not as grave as rape, it is still something that has impact. Think of it this way: If someone punched you in the face, would you feel that you have no right to complain just because he didn’t break your arms and legs too?  Just because I felt like it shouldn’t matter, I thought that I can’t go to the police because they would dismiss me. I spent all those years believing that I have no right to feel bad, and even that it was in some way my fault, that I did something wrong (which, by the way, I didn’t.) So, please, consider this before you comment on similar subject the next time… Because opinions like this do part of the  the damage. Hi, Kristin! I just recently discovered your blog and I love every bit of it. Your adventures are inspiring!I should tell you this: a crazy thing to happen in Nepal! I’ve spent 4 month there and it was one of the most peaceful I’ve felt in my life. But, then again, the same thing happened to me TWICE – the first time, the coward grabbed my boob and run away; the second time, the guy slowly drove away on his bike, as I shouted: “Seriously?! In the middle of the afternoon!” And you’ll never guess where these took place… in Chiang Mai. Literally, one of the safest cities in Southeast Asia, right? I’ve been living in CM for a year and a half, love the city and feel very safe here, despite the isolated episodes.There really are bad apples everywhere. 🙂 Wow you’re kidding! That’s terrible. It makes me so angry when people just take liberties like that because I’m a foreigner and it has kept me out of certain countries where it’s common, to be honest. I never want to be made to feel inferior or unsafe because I’m a woman. I actually have even had issues with cat calling and grabbing (one guy tried to kiss me once on the sidewalk and one chased me down the sidewalk once too!) in Berlin of all places. I’m bummed to hear that happened in Thailand! I’m glad that you still love living there 🙂 A man (approx. 50) clapped hard on my ass in Colombo in a busy street with many shops. Nobody cared although I yelped. UGH. NOT OKAY I am sorry to hear that and as being a Nepalese I apologize with you… Not your fault! Hey Kristin, Hope you are doing well!! It’s so sad to hear incidences like this. Women’s safety has been an important issue from quite a long time. But it seems it will take a lot more than expected, especially in under developed countries like Nepal. I am glad that you faced it bravely and had the guts to write a post about your experience in Nepal. This would help other tourist to keep themselves safe. Thank you so much for sharing your experience…! Hello, I just found your blog and read through several articles, and I felt an urgent need to comment on this subject. Sorry that something like this happened to you! And I believe that it’s great that you didn’t let it discourage you from travelling. Unfortunately, stuff like this happens, and it can happen anywhere. I had been through several assaults like this – all in my home country, all in broad daylight, all in the city center – no way to anticipate it or prevent it. And, luckily, nothing like this happened to me while travelling. People who think travelling is dangerous don’t realize that bad things can happen just anywhere. That being said, I think that when it happens while travelling, in an unfamiliar place, when you can be tired or overwhelmed and generally more vulnerable, it can feel twice as bad. I hope that you will have only more good experiences from now on! I totally agree. Stuff like this sadly does happen almost anywhere (and has since for me unfortunately though not as badly as this time) and it usually comes down to bad luck. First time reader to your blog Kristin, and I must say that I will read up on all your other adventuresI found you by googling ‘is Nepal a safe place to travel’ since I am doing research on the behalf of my girlfriend and her sisters because they have notions of going.  Funny story on how they came to decide on Nepal.  The eldest sister ran into a psychic she knows while she was out and about in a market place.  The psychic (they always correct me by saying that it’s their spiritual adviser) told her that she needs to get to Nepal ASAP.  Now, here is a little backstory on my girlfriend and her entire family….they are a bunch of germaphobe hypochondriacs who have sworn off ever going to India or any immediate neighboring countries.Her sister’s immediate response was,“But I had wanted to go to germany?”Her psychic told her “No, you’re going to Nepal….first…and then at some later time you can visit Germany.”So, it’s been told therefore she will adhere to the Devine voice of her conduit…Nepal it is!Here is where I come in (and don’t you worry I will be going….and I am the only person who is looking forward to whatever chaos….god I love that word…comes our way).  I have a sit down with the sisters this past weekend and I quickly come to the realization that they have no clue where they are going nor do they have any idea of what to do once when they get there.  I don’t even think that my girlfriend could point to Nepal on a Map.I take a deep breathe and I start walking them through from their first step here in the states up to the initial destination of Lumbini, Nepal.  I should mention that they are devout Buddhists and they are doing this on the premise that it will be a pilgrimage.  Personally, I am not religious….but I do have a strong sense of curiosity to fabrics of all religious observations (you can throw in Myths, superstitions and folklores).I am leaning towards endorsing they consider some sort of small tour group that focuses on retracing Buddha’s steps.  It would be a bit more adventurous if I plan out some kind of personalized  set of destinations…but having to travel with them under time constraints, there is no room for error.  Getting lost or ill is not on the to do list…as fun as that may be on the other side of the world.  Don’t forget, I do root for chaos!After reading your story, they are going to need a solid sense of direction and purpose….otherwise, they just might get lost in a maniac mesh of mayhem.Ce Domage as the French tend to say.Can’t wait to read the rest of your entries.Au Revoir madamoiselle Kristin I think it’ll be eye opening for them! KirstenI suggest you to include Pakistan in your list and have the time of your life in wanderlust.Regards Just reading your post and comments. Everyone are talking about same thing, i have not words to say about that. You have such a brave soul. Thank you for sharing your experiences. I can totally relate to it, even if I love to travel. It Happened to me a few times, as sexual disturbances in Japan, Romania on a train and another time in Toluca, MX in the streets.  Even if the world is filled with kind and loving people, but we can’t never be too cautious when we travel. Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy Japan, Romania and Mx. It is just unfortunate for those bad apples out there! Thank you for sharing your story, because I was researching on the safety of kathmandu! Tour guides it is!! 🙂 Yep it’s important to remain cautious, but I’m glad I stayed and got to love Nepal more.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/new-zealand-packing-list/,New Zealand Summer Packing List,New Zealand,"Dreamy New Zealand is incredible to visit at any time of year. With two gorgeous islands and endless adventures to choose from, how can you be prepared without overpacking? The following New Zealand packing list has you covered: Even in the summer, New Zealand can experience several seasons in one day. It’s also rarely super hot, particularly on the South Island where even in the height of summer, I was usually wearing a jacket and pants. Here’s what I recommend bringing:  Keep in mind that I visited New Zealand in the summer. You will encounter snow in the winter or even spring and autumn months, so come prepared for colder temperatures. If hiking, remember the importance of spikes for your shoes and specialized equipment depending on conditions. Picking the right backpack could make or break a trip. I almost always prefer using a backpack over a suitcase, as I never have to worry about walking through cobblestone walkways or dirt roads, and climbing the staircases – it is just so much more convenient. If you do not own a backpack, go to a store that allows you to try the packs on with weight in them (I like REI in the US), or if that’s not available to you, order multiple bags online and return within the time window. Something like this bag is perfect for hiking and for traveling. If you’ll be backpacking, check out this post for a comparison on the top women’s backpacks in the market. Bring a day pack and a sling bag for daily use. A quick note on bringing food: security checks at the airport are extremely strict. Almost all food items are banned unless highly processed, so you are better off not bringing any, and stocking up when you are in the city. For day hikes I like to bring nuts and dried fruit, or a couple of energy bars. Though everyone is different, my dry skin tends to need moisturizers that have lots of aloe and I always wear SPF 30 as well. These are the things I’ve used for years: I’m a photographer, so I can’t imagine going without a camera. Here’s what I always bring: And that’s everything I brought along to New Zealand! I hope this list helps to make your trip more worry-free and easier to plan. Be sure to read my other guides for more on itineraries and how to make the most of your road trip: These have always been my list while backpacking for travel…Thank you once again for adding and reminding the packing list!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-perfect-new-zealand-south-island-itinerary/,The Perfect New Zealand South Island Itinerary,New Zealand,"If you’re craving gorgeous hikes, numerous lakes of different hues of blue from baby to deep sapphire, friendly people and rugged coastline, then you’ve come to the right place. New Zealand’s South Island has it all and more. The thing is, once you begin to do your research, you may come to realize it’s a lot bigger than you anticipated. That always happens, no? Still, there’s a lot you can see in a short amount of time and still get the best of the best into your trip. This itinerary can make the planning so much easier for you. The itinerary begins in Christchurch but you can easily alter it if needed to begin and end in Queenstown. Additionally, this is based on a two-week trip, though there are some additional suggestions at the end if you have more time. You can also add more days and relax it a bit and allow for rain and windy weather (which is guaranteed to happen at some point) if you have a bit more time. Without further ado here’s the ultimate New Zealand South Island Itinerary:  Most major flights will take you into Christchurch as a beginning point. I didn’t spend a ton of time there and viewed it more as a transit point, though there are several things worth doing before you make your way onwards: Stay: The Parkview is close to the park, has free parking, and is close to the temple mentioned, and an organic grocery store. Valley Views is a hidden spot that most tourists would probably pass by if they weren’t in the know. It’s adorable and the perfect stop to break up the drive between Christchurch and Mt. Cook. I felt like I was in the Shire staying in the adorable domes. The main building is where the showers, communal kitchen, and bathrooms are located. It’s all off the grid, running on solar power and with sustainability in mind. They even feed the green kitchen scraps to their chickens! My favorite part was the outdoor bathtubs, each underneath the pine trees and with a view of the mountains. I’m a big fan of showers and tubs with a view and can’t remember a time when I could look up into pines and hear the birds while bathing. Though it’s a little pricey at over $300 NZD/night, it’s a nice experience if it’s within your budget range. You can book it here. You could also bypass this altogether and go the Lake Tekapo route instead. If you’ve seen photos of the incredible lupin on New Zealand’s South Island chances are they were taken at Lake Tekapo. It’s a gorgeous lake with a nice view on the other side of Mt. Cook, however it lacks the same magic if you go outside of lupin season (which is from the end of November until the end of December). It’s still a lovely lake, but you could probably prioritize an extra day elsewhere if you prefer. Stay: I stayed at an Airbnb again (get a discount here). Once again, you’ll be retracing your steps back towards Wanaka to make your way to Mt. Cook. It would be a long drive to do it all in one go, so it might be worth stopping in Wanaka again to break it up. It’s crazy because as the crow flies it looks like it would be right next door, if only there weren’t a huge mountain range in the way! The drive is scenic, along that same gorgeous west coast and then up and along Lake Pukaki. On a clear day it’s worth stopping at the viewpoint and walking down to the shore to marvel at the baby blue water. Here are some great hikes for the area, keeping in mind that Mt. Cook experiences a lot of rain and crazy wind. If you can time this towards the beginning or end of your trip coming or going from Christchurch, look ahead of time to see if you can possibly get some clear weather:  Stay: I stayed at both the Hermitage Hotel and the Aoraki Court Motel and let me just tell you the Aoraki Court Motel is a MUCH better value. The rooms are the same quality, IMO, and you get a kitchen and larger overall suite. It does lack the view that the higher end rooms at the Hermitage have, though. Wanaka was one of my favorite stops thanks to the great hiking in the area. You’re spoiled for choice of lakes, lookout points, and variety of hiking that can be long or short, challenging or easy depending on what you want. These were my favorites: Stay: I actually stayed at an Airbnb (get a discount here) in Albert Town and thought it was perfect. It’s only a few minutes’ drive from Wanaka and is a bit calmer and quieter. You’ll notice upon arriving in Queenstown that there’s a lot more of a party and adventure vibe than the previous spots on this itinerary. It’s a ski town in the winter and a spot for bungee jumping, skydiving, and speed boating as well. There are lots of bars and breweries in town and hostels as well. I only stayed for a night because I prefer quieter places, but still enjoyed the gondola (figured my knees needed a break after the hiking in Wanaka) and views at sunset. Stay: I stayed at an Airbnb again (get a discount here) with a lovely view of the lake and easy access to the water. I recommend looking for something with a view! This will be a significant deviation from the route that will require you to backtrack later, but it’s worth it. Milford Sound and Fiordland National Park are gorgeous and the Gertrude Saddle hike is worth the trek out to Te Anau. Alternatively, if you’d really rather not make the long drive, you can take a bus + boat tour from Queenstown (however keep in mind it’s 4 hours each way in a bus in one day) or take a helicopter + boat ride which, on a clear day, is probably more than worth the money. Since I wanted to hike instead of boat, I drove to Te Anau, stayed for a couple of nights, and drove out to the end of the road in Milford Sound and then retraced my steps a bit to do the Gertrude Saddle track. Here are a few more options and more details on Gertrude Saddle: Stay: I stayed at an Airbnb again (get a discount here) with a full kitchen. I love doing this in New Zealand! Like many places in New Zealand, this isn’t going to be quick or easy to get to, and you’ll have to retrace your steps all the way back past Wanaka (perhaps stop there for another hike) and continue upwards up the west coast. That said, it’s a gorgeous drive in a more rural and lush part of the island and the glaciers are incredible to see! Stay: Book a hotel here. Here’s the map. As you can see, New Zealand’s roads don’t exactly make for the most logical driving directions, but the drives are so lovely, it’s hard to complain. Scroll down for some variations and add-ins:  Though the suggestions above are what I personally tried, there are so many variations that you can do. The following are a few places that I’d love to check out and would recommend you try to fit in if you have more time or end up cutting out one of the aforementioned items on the itinerary: Marlborough Sounds: If you decide to keep heading north after Fox Glacier, it’ll be a long drive but you’ll be rewarded with the amazing Marlborough Sounds. They do dolphin swims and boat cruises there, though my sights would be set on the hiking trails which take you well over the sounds for amazing sunset and sunrise views. Nugget Point: If you decide to head south then back up the east coast after Te Anau, not only does the drive look amazing, but you’ll get to stop by Nugget Point, which as a photographer was one of my dream spots. If you’re super into photography look it up and see if it’s worth the stop for you! Dunedin: Dunedin has cultural centers, a rugged coastline with the arches of Tunnel Beach, and the Otago Peninsula where you can have penguin sightings. It’s a university town that I haven’t checked out yet but heard good things about. Most of the streets in New Zealand are just two lanes and as long as you’re comfortable with driving on the lefthand side (which is easy to get pretty quickly, at least for me), it’s pretty easy, straightforward driving. I recommend picking up a rental car at the airport, or going for a camper van for even more ease and flexibility. I hope that helps to narrow down some of the choices. When it came to planning out a New Zealand trip, I quickly realized it’s a lot bigger than it seems and there’s so much more to see than can fit into a few weeks, but it’s a big world, we only have so much time, and this itinerary helps to maximize it. These are some highlights you’re sure to remember and enjoy, and that photograph beautifully. Happy travels! *Some links in this post are affiliate links. Any booking you make supports this site at no extra cost whatsoever to you. I only recommend companies I’ve actually used and places I’ve stayed. Thanks for supporting!  This looks like such a great itinerary! (especially the Valley Views spot) I got to visit New Zealand a few years ago, but I don’t think I was able to hit any of these locations. Have you ever been to the North Island? And do you have any recommendations for what to do there? All of these hiking trails look amazing! Especially Roy’s Peak and Gertrude Saddle! What is, in your opinion, the best time of year to hike these trails? Honestly the fall would be best, or winter with some snow on the peaks, but summer is probably the easiest and warmest but with more people.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/gertrude-saddle-track/,How to Hike Gertrude Saddle in Milford Sound,New Zealand,"The Gertrude Saddle track in Fiordland National Park on New Zealand’s South Island was a highlight of my time driving around New Zealand. It was a unique experience in the Milford Sound area that deviates from the typical boat cruise. Prior to attempting the hike, I scanned the DOC info and kept reading how advanced the route was and how dangerous it could be. It really seems like they’re trying to scare everyone away from trying it. And yet, the photos online looked so incredible, I couldn’t be swayed. When I finally saw the view for myself, I was so glad I did it. The reviews online were right – it’s an insanely gorgeous view and hike in general. Was it as crazy as the online info said? Yes and No. Gertrude Saddle is an out and back trail that starts flat and turns sharply upwards. It’s only 7km (4.3 miles) in length but it can take time due to the steepness of the route to get up to the Black Lake and the saddle thereafter. Give it at least 6 hours, just in case. In all honesty this route gets sketchy AF in certain places. It gets very steep on rocks that would turn slick if wet. I heard a rock fall while I was there and understood why they say not to climb when there’s snow. Avalanche danger is very real there, but is it really an ‘expert route’? Upon entering the hike, you’ll see signs warning you of the dangers and telling you that several people have died on the route – which is believable if one were to go off-trail on accident. Since then, they’ve marked it better with more orange poles and triangles. The biggest issues will be getting off-trail and going at the wrong time. Plan on seeing these morbid signs over and over as you progress. They really, really only want those who are fit and capable to attempt it. I’ve done some hiking in the desert and route finding with a map and compass in Alaska. I’m not the most spatially aware person but this trail is pretty well-marked. I don’t know that you really need to be an ‘expert’ because at any given point, you can see where the next marker is. If you don’t see it, just keep looking. There’s always another one visible. On the rare occasion that it’s not, look for the rock cairns (stacks). That said, I’d be careful of following them blindly coming down. A few led me to an area that would have been a pretty steep climb down, which made me wonder why they were there at all. Instead I suggest looking for the orange arrows and poles, which will always steer you in the right direction. I also followed the route on my maps.me offline map. Once you get to the top, there will be cables to hold onto to climb up and back down again. Stick near them because in some cases you might be glad to have them there for assistance. I didn’t always use them since they’re so close to the rock and I had to bend so far down to hold on, but in some cases I did need them. The online directions and the posted signs will warn to only attempt the hike on a clear day. This is sound advice, because if it does rain, the trail, which is already steep and slippery, would turn lethal. It had been raining on and off on the day that I went. We decided to drive all the way to the end of the road and check out Milford Sound to let the weather clear up first, and I could see some blue sky peeking out of the clouds when we started the route in the afternoon. Everyone coming down as we headed up reported that they couldn’t see anything. The cloud cover was too thick at the top. At that point I realized why it’s such a bad idea to go when the weather isn’t clear – not only could you lose the route coming down due to fog, but there’s really no point because you won’t see anything at the top. We were the last to attempt the route on the day, and as luck would have it, got a few moments of clarity as the fog parted. It didn’t sound like anyone else actually saw the view all the way to the sound who went on the same day. In hindsight, we were pretty lucky to have seen anything at all, to have been able to find our way back down, and to not get rained on again. We should have followed the DOC’s advice, yet it’s hard to say I have any regrets given the views we had. Everyone has to make their own call on what they think is safe and be honest with themselves about their abilities. As a commenter below noted, search and rescue is often volunteer-run and not always immediately available in sparsely-populated New Zealand, so only attempt this if you really know what you’re doing and have experience with route finding and rock scrambling. Be sure to bring along plenty of water and food for the trip. You can refill if you bring some kind of filter as you’ll be hiking along and crossing a waterfall, plus coming up to a lake. Make sure that your shoes have ample tread (I love these). You’ll be walking on rocks without any grip. This is absolutely essential. If you have a place where you can strap hiking poles to your pack once you get to the rock, I do think they would have been helpful for part of the hike up and wish I’d had them to stabilize myself on my way back down. Make sure that you’re not doing any part of this hike in the dark. It’s essential that you can see the markers and the cliff drop-offs. This is not a sunrise or sunset hike prospect. Finally, take the warnings seriously, be honest with yourself about your abilities, and watch the weather forecast. If it looks like rain, check out Lake Marian or the Key Summit Track. If all of those things are in your favor, this has to be one of the best under the radar hikes in Fiordland National Park. Hey Kristin! As one of your Kiwi readers, just wanted to share another perspective on the signposting – inexperienced hikers getting into trouble is a serious issue in NZ, we are a sparsely populated country, a lot of search and rescue is done by volunteers (or at significant cost to local authorities) and of course we want to try and avoid visitors getting hurt or worse! But it’s great you enjoyed it! Good to know! Very kind of volunteers to do so. Thanks for sharing. Actually I added a little paragraph in there with what you commented here. I appreciate the input! Awesome, thanks!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/roys-peak-or-isthmus-peak/,A Comparison of Roy’s Peak vs. Isthmus Peak in Wanaka,New Zealand,"There are plenty of incredible hikes in Wanaka but two stand out as particularly beautiful with breathtaking views: Roy’s Peak and Isthmus Peak. Both are a relentless uphill climb without shade or more than a fleeting flat part. You might be asking yourself as you trudge ever upward, “Why do I even like things like this?!” only to reach the top and remember as you gaze out at the view you’ve earned. So which one is better? Which one should you do? I climbed both, back-to-back, because I’m insane and also so that you don’t have to. If you’re trying to decide which is right for you, look no further. Here’s the comparison of Roy’s Peak vs. Isthmus Peak:  By far the most famous and popular of the two hikes, Roy’s Peak delivers in terms of views. Not only do you have the famous viewpoint, but the peak at the top as well with a straight-on view of Mt. Aspiring. It’s also slightly closer to Wanaka if you don’t have your own transport. Many hostels organize transport as well, particularly for sunrise. That brings me to time of day – Roy’s is stellar at both sunrise and sunset. I’m not sure if there’s a big enough edge of sunrise over sunset for me to feel motivated to wake up at 2am to start hiking considering that the sunrise and sunset both illuminate the mountain from the side. The sunset bonus is it’s a bit less crowded and you’ll see Mt. Aspiring turn pink as the sun sets on a clear day. Of course, at sunrise you’d be doing the toughest part of the hike without the sun beating down on you. It’s a completely uncovered hike, after all. I personally started at 5pm in January and by 6:30 half of the track was shaded due to the positioning of the sun, though the first hour was hot. This turned out to be perfect timing, based on my pace, for golden hour at the viewpoint and sunset at the peak. If you do this be sure to bring warm layers and a headlamp. The rumors are true that there are queues at the top for photos at the peak. When you see it for yourself you’ll appreciate why – it’s breathtaking. This didn’t bother me all that much but it’s annoying to others who don’t want a crowded hike. My queue was also shorter which I attribute to going at sunset.  Though this isn’t that big of a deal, it bears mentioning that Roy’s asks a $2 entry fee. Not a big deal but it’s not totally free like Isthmus.  Isthmus gives you a beautiful 360-degree view of both Lake Hawea and Lake Wanaka. The layers of mountains and rock formations provide impressive photo ops all along the way. This hike also receives much less traffic than Roy’s. I think this is because it hasn’t become as insta famous, even though it’s so beautiful in its own right. Plan on no queues for photos, and fewer people in general, particularly if you go for sunrise, which I wish I’d done. This hike was tougher on me because of all of the ‘false peaks’. It keeps looking like you’re about to be at the end then NOPE! Another curve and another few hundred meters to climb. If you know this going into it, then no big deal. But in the middle of the day when I went, under that relentless sun, it was demoralizing.  This one is also a bit outside of Wanaka – about 20-25 minutes by car. It’s a lovely drive and no big deal if you have wheels but you might struggle to get there if not. Both hikes are almost the same in terms of elevation gain and distance. Which is to say, both are a relentless uphill on switchbacks. The trails are wide dirt tracks that are ridiculously easy to follow for both. Neither hike has any shade and both have limited water refill opportunities. Both have lots of lambs on the trail, which are cute, but neither is what I’d call a wilderness experience. Both hikes have some of the most beautiful viewpoints I’ve seen, plus plenty of great views as you make your way back down. Both gave me a great sense of accomplishment and fantastic photo ops. Both would be better as sunrise or sunset hikes to avoid the midday sun. Both would also be stunning at any time of year.  Though both were incredible hikes, I have to give the edge to Roy’s Peak. Yes, it was more crowded and yes, I did have to wait for a turn to take my photo, but by going at sunset, and especially if you hiked it at any season other than summer, it would be less crowded. That said, if you want no crowds at all, I suspect Isthmus at sunrise would be your best bet. I can just imagine how breathtaking it would be at sunrise in the winter or late spring while there’s snow on the peaks as the sun lights them up. That’s a strong enough reason for me to come back, and truth be told I’d do them both again in a heartbeat. How incredible! I’ll be in NZ starting in Auckland and heading down for 5-6 weeks alone, SO EXCITED! Did you have any luck with rental car relocation? That’s my plan for cheap/free transport. Thanks for the itinerary! I just rented one but that’s a good idea! The relocations are only south to north, as most tourists start in Auckland and finish in Chch, leaving a glut of cars. There is also a time limit to get the cars from A to B, meaning this is not really a suitable option for touring the country, more for those needing to get somewhere quickly and are happy to drive long distances to save a bit of money on flying. Thanks for the info! Nice post. This was really helpful post, thanks! Your effort really great how possible about what you did, your picture speak your effort. Thank you! All the pics are splendid!!!! You always inspires me to travel or do regular things on my own!!!! Thanks for sharing such inspiring blogs.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/most-beautiful-places-in-new-zealand/,10 Iconic Views in New Zealand You Can’t Miss,New Zealand,"The following post is by Liz Carlson: New Zealand is truly a country that can take a lifetime to explore. From the lush fern-covered rainforests to world-class beaches, to towering mountain ranges. A visit to New Zealand will give you an overwhelming selection of activities, all of them worthy of your time. But unless you’re planning to spend decades exploring this special country, you’ll have to be deliberate in what you see and what you do. While every area is deserving of your time, here are the 10 iconic views in New Zealand you truly can’t miss! Located at the far north of New Zealand at the tip top of the North Island, Cape Reinga is known as the point where the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean meet. A short walk to the picturesque lighthouse puts you nose to nose with the “leaping off” place. Māori legends have it that the spirits of the dead travel to Cape Reinga on their path to the afterlife, where the leap off the land and climb up the roots of the 800-year-old Pōhutukawa tree where they enter the underworld and return to the homeland. Enjoy the stunning coastline or head to the surprisingly massive sand dunes for a bit of sand dune surfing. Northland at the top of New Zealand is home to some of the best views and is still relatively unexplored by international visitors. The coastal towns west of Auckland boast some of the most unique beaches in the country. This black sand beach can be quickly accessed from Auckland, making it a popular weekend getaway for city dwellers. Despite its popularity, the isolation and ruggedness make it feel like you’re far away from the real world. The Coromandel Peninsula extends east of Auckland and offers the best combination of dense vegetation alongside rocky coastal roads. Pack your hiking boots and your sandals for this special area. The mountainous peninsula lets visitors explore some of the best beaches in New Zealand as well as some epic mountain hikes through thick rainforest covered peaks. After a long hike, reward yourself with a good soak at Hahei Beach where, if you time it right at low tide, you can dig your own thermal hot pool and soak your weary bones. Traversing to the western side of the North Island will put you at the bottom of Mt. Taranaki, which is actually an active stratovolcano in the Egmont National Park. A huge, perfect conical volcano, this area is fun year-round with skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. If you’re experienced and fit and the weather is fine in summer, it’s a great peak to tackle – or get your ass kicked. Once you’ve had your fill of adventure in the mountains, spend some time exploring one of New Zealand’s up and coming trendy towns, New Plymouth. The Tongariro National Park is a must-see for any Lord of the Ring fan (i.e. everyone in the universe, I’m assuming). Home to one of New Zealand’s best day walks, the Tongariro Crossing, this national park will keep you busy for days. The Tongariro Alpine Crossing is a doozy of a day hike and is the top of the bucketlist for many. Traversing a lunar landscape of toxic lakes, steaming vents and active volcanoes, it truly feels like you’re on mars. For those with a real sense of adventure, hike to the top of Mt. Ruapehu, an active volcano and the highest point in the North Island. If you make it to the top, you’ll actually be able to feel the warm rocks of the volcano top. The Abel Tasman is an adventure seeker’s dream! Known for its golden beaches and year-round good weather, it’s no wonder it’s a dream location for most visitors. The Abel Tasman is the only Great “Walk” that can also be kayaked. For those who prefer to see the sea, kayak your way along beautiful coastlines, exploring the bays and coves, maybe even kayaking your way to one of the handful of DOC huts for the night. If you’re lucky, you might even get a glimpse of the neighborhood stingrays and dolphins or even orca! For those who want to walk a bit, get a taxi to any point and walk yourself back. The area is the perfect mix of adventure and relaxation. This gem of an area often gets overlooked for travelers on a time limit but it’s worth the stop as you make your way down the South Island. This area is a good introduction to the stunning mountain ranges you’ll find in the South Island. Relax by Lake Rotoiti where you can catch a water taxi or stay overnight in a hut that you hike to. For those looking for a bit more adventure, a 2-3 day walk into Angelus Hut will give you the best snapshot of this magical area but best come prepared. For those looking for a place that is truly rugged and untouched, look no further than the West Coast. This sparsely populated and remote area is the famous home of the Franz Josef and Fox Glaciers but that’s not all there is to see in this vastly expansive area. Most alpine hikes will perch you on mountains that offer views of both the Southern Alps and the Tasman Sea. Even if you’re not an adventure seeker, this area is a must see. The drive alone down the rugged and densely vegetated coastline will surely be one of the most memorable parts of your trip! Perhaps the most iconic view in New Zealand is one of the ever impressive Aoraki/Mt Cook, New Zealand’s tallest mountain. Regarded as the home of alpinism in New Zealand, this area is steeped in climbing history. Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to tackle Mt. Everest, grew his mountain legs in the Mt. Cook mountains. Although the weather can be fickle, this area is worth holding out for. When you finally get a glimpse of this famous mountain, you’ll want to stay forever! Whether you go for an easy stroll down the Hooker Valley track or tackle some of the bigger peaks, there are plenty of great views to be had here. No iconic New Zealand list is complete without a mention of Milford Sound. Located in Fiordland National Park, this area should be on every traveler’s list. Vertical cliffs, rushing waterfalls, cheeky keas, and peaceful sounds are all part of the package in Milford. Whether you explore by foot, helicopter, boat or kayak, it’s impossible to have bad views. Even in the pouring rain (which is a frequent occurrence), Milford Sound never ceases to be amazing and comes alive with hundreds of temporary waterfalls cascading down its cliffs. This magical place is well worth a detour from your South Island road trip Trust me, you won’t regret spending any time here!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/off-the-beaten-path-new-zealand/,10 Spots to Get off the Beaten Path in New Zealand,New Zealand,"The following post is by Liz Carlson: Without a doubt over the past two years New Zealand has quickly become one of those “it”destinations. Shots of its incredible hikes, natural wonders and epic landscapes galore plaster our news feeds and apps 24/7. Made famous by the Lord of the Rings and social media, this little nation at the edge of the world has seen a tourism boom so fast it’ll leave your head spinning. But it leaves us to wonder, are there still places to get off the beaten path? Absolutely. I’ve been living down in the land of the long white cloud for the past five years, and I have a lot of fave spots and haunts in New Zealand. Like, a lot. And If you’ve followed on my blog for while, you’ll have heard me mention it once or five times. Because in a country filled with scenic extremes, how can I only have one? Seriously, it’s just not possible. Some are well-known and well-loved, while others you’ve never heard of. But I have to admit, there’s something special about the more untouched locations. I mean, I’ll have a vino in a crowded wine bar any day, but an afternoon in the mountains with nothing but the wind and a kea for company is the best. Keas are native New Zealand mountain parrots, and they are SO NAUGHTY. A question I’m often asked is what places in New Zealand should we visit outside the main areas? And to be honest, it’s a tough one! Because there are just so many, and frankly, some of them are local secrets where I would be murdered if I blogged about them. Sorry! But luckily there’s a happy medium. From high glacial lakes to isolated beaches to secluded bubbling springs to geological formations that you can’t quite believe are real, Kiwiland is brimming with the extraordinary and often still untouched. So, here’s ten of my favourite off-the-beaten-track locations to visit, if you want to escape the world for little while. Okay, I’m not going to lie, the hike up here is an absolute bitch. Located in the Siberia Valley, a remote corner within Mt Aspiring National Park on the west coast side and less visited than its neighbor in west Wanaka, Lake Crucible certainly meets my ‘off the beaten track’ criteria. The best way to visit Lake Crucible is by the Siberia Experience, a local tourism activity (that is still super underrated guys), where you fly into the Siberia hut, drop your overnight bags, then hike up to the lake as a day trip, return and overnight in the hut, then hike a few hours out the next day and get picked up by a jetboat to zoom your way back to Makarora. Otherwise you can do it all hiking but you’ll have two days of a very long boring walk in and out. Best to do in summer, with lots of icebergs in early summer. You’ll arrive in a field in a little yellow plane, and spend the next few hours walking in the shadow of Mt Awful and Mt Dreadful wishing you were on a beach, preferably with a cocktail. I think there’s about 10 river crossings, most of which are mellow but freezing. It’s not a hike for beginners – you need river crossing and route finding experience and to be pretty fit. But seriously, all that negativity comes to a screaming halt when you summit that final moraine and this truly outstanding lake comes into view. I mean, it has icebergs. I can’t even. What more could you want from a humble alpine pond? I first came across this beach when I was road-tripping from the North Island down to Wanaka to live on the South Island. It seemed magical then, and it’s still magical now! Part of the Coromandel Peninsula, New Chums is a secluded white stretch of sand that you have to hike to get to. And like most walks in NZ ‘hike’ is an understatement. This beach is not easy to get to! I spent the entire time trying not to break an ankle as I scrambled over slippery seaweed covered boulders that stank to high heaven. Luckily, my perseverance paid off and I emerged out onto its pristine, deserted shores. Winning! This one combines two of my favourite things – birds and rocks (cue, eye roll – yes I’m aware I’m a nerd). Located in the Hawke’s Bay region of New Zealand, most people visit here for the Art Deco scene, or the wine. Though, you should rethink your priorities though because bird and rocks is where it’s at! Set on 13 hectares of private land including several spectacular geological cliff formations, this Department of Conservation managed colony is the largest mainland gannet population in the world. Visit via a gentle walking track, or take a safari beach tour-by-tractor. Definitely do the latter. Why walk when you can tractor? Ok, so these springs aren’t quite so off-the-beaten-track as the other locations. Golden Bay has always been a classic summer kiwi holiday spot, but hasn’t become part of the more recent tourist boom. But I’m adding it in anyway because the Te Waikoropupū Springs are often overlooked at least by foreign tourists. And, well – they shouldn’t be. The largest freshwater spring in the Southern Hemisphere, the ‘Pupu Springs’ are also the clearest in the world, bested only by the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica. Boom! They discharge 14,000 litres of water per second. Thats 40 bathtubs by the way. Per second! An easy, breezy stroll – you’ll arrive in your childhood dream of a fairytale glen complete with lily pads, frogs and every shade of green there ever was. Ladies, you’re welcome. But remember you can’t touch the water and you DEFINITELY can’t swim in them (anymore). Sacred to local Māori, the Pupu Springs are considered taonga (treasure) and wāhi tapu, a place held in high cultural and spiritual regard, so hands off. This one’s all about the wine which makes it a real favorite of mine (ok, an extra special fave, considering this is already a list of favorites). Only an hour north of Christchurch, the Waipara Valley wine region is often bypassed in favour of the more prominent Central Otago, famous for its Pinot Noirs. And while it’s no secret I love the autumnal hues of my adopted home turf, Waipara is really something special. It produces internationally award-winning Pinot Noir, Riesling and Chardonnay and, guys, it has TRUFFLES. Seriously. You can go truffle foraging! It’s a magical dry valley with some of the friendliest locals you’ll meet, a great diverse landscape with the sea right nearby, and its own boutique hub of wineries and foodie spots waiting to be discovered. It’s also home to to a ton of fossils, including the world’s oldest penguin fossil and a 10 km oyster bed. Put this one on your list, pronto! Before I moved to Wanaka, I’d never heard of Curio Bay, or The Catlins, where its located. Chances are, you won’t have either. And also I’m going to be in trouble for sharing this one, sorry! One of the country’s best, ‘best kept’ secrets, tucked away at the bottom of the South Island, Curio Bay is wild and desolate, but at the same time full of life. Wildlife that is. Which is just the way I like it! You’ll see a petrified forest, seals, native birds (love me some birds) and if you’re lucky – dolphins and Yellow-Eyed Penguins. Check out the waterfalls, the local surf school and the historic lighthouses. Oh, and you’ll likely have the place to yourself. Ticks all the boxes. The Dimholt Road and the Paths of the Dead (nerd alert!), I mean the Putangirua Pinnacles, are a series of spooky pillar formations in the Wairarapa region just two hours from Wellington. Most tourists come for the wine, but I say come for the wine with a side of geology. And obvs, I’m a little biased because it was the setting for some major Lord of The Rings scenes. But Despite the Tolkien fanfare, it’s still mostly passed over due to its isolation and the fact you have to hike to get there. A couple hours drive from Wellington, this corner of the North Island is still very local in feel and very much off the beaten tourist trail. But unlike Crucible and New Chums, this one is a fairly straightforward 4 hour round trip and not too challenging. So getcha fantasy on people! Middle Earth awaits! Ok, so this one’s not technically off the beaten track. Buuuuut it definitely fits the brief for hidden in plain sight. I mean, I’ve only just heard of it myself! Situated in and around the central city is the most incredible Street Art trail. Like, incredible. Dunedin has always been sort of a grungy, university art town in the South Island, but recently it’s really been up and coming with a growing foodie scene, some of the best coffee in New Zealand, and the most kickass street art scene around. With some of the most prominent street artists in the world commissioned including Belgium’s ROA, this epic cultural trail takes Dunedin to a whole other level. I did a tour with Victoria of Street Kiwi, and you should probs do the same. You’ll get all the back-stories and see all the artwork – including pieces you just wouldn’t find alone. It’s a win/win I say. When I say Jackson Bay is remote, I mean it’s end-of-the-line remote. I think there’s like less than 30 people that actually live here. Which is why it’s awesome, obviously! On the West Coast of the South Island just past Haast, Jackson Bay is surrounded by rainforest, and is one of only places in New Zealand regularly used as a wild nursery for the rare Hector’s dolphin. Because you have to drive well off the main highway to get here, it’s often overlooked by road-trippers. Oh and you pretty much have to camp. With incredible views of the Southern Alps, it’s secluded and calm and the best place to hide from the world. If you’re looking to hide, that is! Flag the the Bay of Islands, cancel Mangonui and Whangarei and go to the Kauri Coast instead. Ok, ok, don’t bypass them altogether but you MUST (yes, I’m shouting ‘must’) visit the west coast of Northland too. Wild and remote, this place is as close to untouched New Zealand as your gonna get. Think towering Kauri plantations – including the oldest living tree in New Zealand and Māori god of the forest, Tāne Mahuta – dramatic deserted beaches and cute holiday towns. Visit the Waipoua Forest with a local Māori guide, and check out the Trounson Kauri Park for a chance to see the Kiwi, New Zealand’s rare nocturnal national bird in the wild. Guys, you can see a Kiwi IN THE WILD. Enough said. About the Author: Liz Carlson is the founder of Young Adventuress, a solo female travel blog.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/waiheke-island-activities/,Offbeat Travel: Hiking Your Own Trail on Waiheke Island,New Zealand,"Day 181 Today marks six months since I left home to live a life of travel.  I am not sure where the time went, but it has become more and more clear to me that I hope this never ends.  There have been tremendous ups and downs, all through Asia and Australia; all have been beautiful, and all have been transformative. Today sees me in New Zealand with none other than my lovely mother!  Though it is my first time here, she came to Middle Earth (before it was so-dubbed) just over 30 years ago.  It’s interesting to hear about what has changed since now and then. Eager to explore something a little different, we hopped on the ferry from Auckland over to Waiheke Island – a place that more than a few people told me we just had to check out when we got out here. We followed their advice, and we’re very glad that we did: Auckland is a beautiful city, but it’s not very off-the-beaten path, and that’s really my modus operandi.  My mother’s is hiking. By visiting Waiheke, we managed to hit both. We selected the Northern Walk, encompassing Matiatia Historic Reserve, Owhanake Bay, and Oneroa beach.  This allowed us to see as much of the island as possible without having to stray too far from the ferry stop. There are other trails including the Southern Walk, which is perfect for bird and wildlife watching; the Hekerua Palm Beach & Rocky Bay trail, ideal for seeing different beaches on the island, and the Wakanewha Walk, which offers sightings at the island’s biggest beach, and only takes an hour to complete.   I’m fairly certain I’ve never seen water quite this color.  It seemed to change as we made our way down the walking trail, most likely due to depth (I’m a sharp one, yes.  Got that all figured out). What’s more, I’ve seldom gone on a hike without ever seeing another person on the trail.  I felt we had hit the off-beat jackpot given that we never did over the duration of our two-hour hike. The day culminated with just a taste of wine at one of the gorgeous vineyards on the island.  We had earned it, after all. It was the perfect way to spend my six-month travelversary, and I feel lucky to spend this milestone in the company of family.  I feel even luckier that I have been able to impress her with my ability to drive on the opposite side of the road.  I’m sure you can agree, where family is involved, you really really want to show them a good time, especially when you don’t get to see them that often. So far, we’re doing well. Do it yourself: Breathtaking images! I hope to make it to NZ on my travels 🙂 Thank you! You should go! Oh wow! This is just fabulous. I too, as a solo traveler, spent 5 days on Waiheke just about a month before your visit. I chose the southern walk and was just as  impressed that the trail was so clearly sign posted and I didn’t see another human for a good 2 hrs.Southern walk leaves Matiatia Bay right from the ferry and through the bush up the headlands. Amazing views of Auckland (- just love SkyTower that can be seen from all parts of north island) On top of the lookout point was the best scrap wood structure with the swings!  Then trail curves around and down to Church Bay.  Then walking around the pastures and through more fern bush, I emerged at a road where some local kiwis gave me a lift back to Oneroa ( and a bag of fresh fruit from their garden).  It was one of the best days of my NZ travels. That island is amazing.  I will definetly be going back at some point.  Thank you for sharing your photos, I now can see ‘the path not taken’ as they say.Best to you, CC Chris,Thanks for your thoughtful comment! That’s pretty cool that you got a ride and some fruit from locals.  Kiwis have turned out to be extremely nice.  Falling more in love with this place every day. Made it up to Bay of Islands as well, but I don’t think it’s as off-beat.  Still, breathtaking. If you are ever back in NZ, head check out the Otago Railway Trail for something off the beaten path. (About 1hr from Queenstown on a bus). Its an old railway line converted into a bicycle track. You ride for 4 days across the South Island from Clyde to Middlemarch and stop at some very old school traditional kiwi towns. Easy ride through beautiful Otago countryside – dedicated track so no cars How long did this route take you? An afternoon Heading to NZ this weekend and have a couple days to kill in Auckland before heading south – wanted to find a good, safe solo walking track on waiheke (I love wine but not enough to drink it all day) and this looks perfect! Thanks so much for posting! yay have fun! Which winery did you stop at? We are going to be visiting Waiheke at the beginning of April and want to experience a hike followed by one winery for food (for non drinkers) and of course some wine for the rest of us. 🙂 I honestly have no idea which one it was, but you’ll pass by several and you can pick and choose! Hey girl! Just came across your blog, love it! Waiheke Island is one of my favorite places! Loved your article! The wineries on Waiheke Island were amazing! Best of luck in your travels!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/franz-josef-glacier/,On Cracking Glaciers and Snow-Covered Mountaintops,New Zealand,"Day 190 I have a confession to make: I let my mom plan our entire New Zealand trip because, as a friend of mine from home once put it so eloquently, when it comes to travel I am “unbelievably lazy.” You know how I just kind of happen to wander and base my next move on whatever travelers in my current locale tell me to see?  That usually works out pretty well, and that’s how my contribution to the trip, Waiheke Island, happened to come about.  Other than that, though?  Yeah, I didn’t plan a thing.  It turns out that I put my faith in the right hands, though, because my mom did a fantastic job by picking Franz Josef Glacier for us to visit during our time on the south island.  Though she had seen glaciers from her geophysicist days, I had never in my life seen one before.  I am a Californian after all, we don’t really have them in my home state.  You guys, I didn’t know what I had been missing: There are two main glaciers in the area: Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers.  One has a few options for getting up close and personal with them – hike right on up (as we did in this case), hike directly on the glacier, or fly over it. We also chose to fly over it, so that we could see this: And this… And a little more of this: For about 40 minutes via helicopter, we circled the glacier and various surrounding mountain tops, seeing the glacier from a different point of view. In total, we spent 3 days getting up close with the glaciers, enjoying the intense blues and beautiful surroundings. Turns out that this time, planning wins. In the spirit of full disclosure: We were treated to the helicopter tour by Fox & Franz Josef Heliservices who did not request that I write a favourable review or comment on the blueness of New Zealand in general. All opinions are my own.  Stunning pics!! New Zealand is definitely up there on my list of places to see. Thanks! Wow. That is just stunning! NZ is my next stop. I’m coming over to visit my sister in Auckland before doing a work visa in Sydney. I’m going to add this trip to my itinerary – even though I’m petrified of flying! Glad to hear it! Let me know how it goes 🙂 It went pretty damn well!! Stunning views. I went with the same company and they were fab. I love how they prepared your group photo while still on the glacier! Thanks for inspiring me to do this! That’s absolutely awesome! Glad to hear that you went with them and enjoyed the experience. I love hearing when someone takes my advice and tries the same thing and ends up loving it. Makes this whole blogging thing worthwhile 🙂 Was definitely a good call! Whoa! Incredible shots! I love glaciers – there’s something that’s soo powerful and majestic about them. Thanks! I agree, they’re quite something to see I saw my glaciers in Alaska, so in NZ, we hiked the Milford Track from Lake Te Anau to Milford Sound on the South Island. 4 nights on the trail and only 35 miles — but there was a mountain involved. It was definitely one of my best trip planning moments—especially because the trip was really to Perth, Australia.  http://www.boomeresque.com/the-finest-walk-in-the-world-the-milford-track-south-island-new-zealand/ Haha, trip was really to Perth? What’s the story there? Your mom did an incredible job planning this trip, WoW it looks so impressive.Stunning photos. I so want to visit New Zealand, maybe next year. Thanks! I agree, she did great. These are beautiful photos!  I went to the Fox Glacier a few years ago, and now I’m wishing I would’ve sprung for the helicopter ride.  The aerial view gives you such a different perspective on the glacier. It does! But I can understand where you’re coming from – activities in NZ are realllly expensive. I know I should be looking at the glaciers, but I was looking at your cute sunglasses! Exploring the Fox and Franz Josef glaciers is an incredible experience in itself. But to actually walk on top of these mighty rivers of ice, to get that immersive sensation, that really is special! I also did this helicopter flight and glacier landing when visiting Fox and Franz Josef and I was truly blown away by the staggering size and beauty of these glaciers.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/new-zealand-is-blue/,"New Zealand is Blue, and I Mean that in the Best Possible Way",New Zealand,"I had always thought of New Zealand as somewhere intensely green, populated with hobbits, and golden-haired, soft-featured, pointy-eared elves with devastatingly attractive accents. I went with very little of an idea of what to expect, and really, no plans, as is common with me. So it’s no surprise I had no idea what shades of intense blue I’d encounter in New Zealand.  I had known I’d be spending a lot of time on water (’tis an island nation, after all), but I could have never imagined the varying shades of blue I’d see, many for the first time in my life, all in the span of just a few minutes while moving along a hiking path, or bumping along the waves on a boat. I saw so much beauty, and was so moved: And let’s be frank, I came to New Zealand more than a little blue in the wake of a mistake.  I was happy to finally be moving forward and back on my travel path, but there are always those nagging feelings of regret and of course, the hits to your pride and confidence that come about as a result of your world being shaken. I left feeling encouraged, excited, and inspired.  Thanks, New Zealand, for bringing back my travel mojo.  Special thanks to my mother as well, for being there through my transition from past to present. Nice pics, my fave is the one with the pebbles 🙂 Thanks 🙂 I wondered how the rock thing started.  The whole beach was covered! Wow! Stunning photos. New Zealand is my next destination, and this post has got me even more excited than I was already! You’re going to love it!! Waiheke is just a ferry ride away from Auckland. You can easily do it as a day trip.  Have fun! so gorgeous Beautiful!! Every picture I’ve seen out of New Zealand makes me want to visit even more and more.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/bay-of-islands/,Islands of Blue Dolphins,New Zealand,"Day 182 I remember the Island of the Blue Dolphins from when I was a child.  It was about a young girl who was stranded on San Nicholas island off the coast of California for 18 years (true story).  She forms a close bond with the animals on the island, and builds herself a house of wale bones. I traveled to San Nicholas during my university years in Santa Barbara, and imagined what life must have been like for her.  The island was gorgeous, framed by deep blue water and the rich marine life of the California coast.  Yesterday, the same thoughts came flooding back as I watched dolphins jump out of the waves in the Bay of Islands in New Zealand – a place I may somehow love even more. Yesterday, it was the same girl standing on the edge of a ship, always at the front, for love of the spray of the waves and the dancing movement they impart on the vessel, as the one who gazed upon the island in wonderment during her younger years.  Seven years later, she found herself face to face, once again with bottle nose dolphins, thinking just what she’d say when she wrote this blog. Only to realize that the photos really speak for themselves: Only this wasn’t just one island, it was an entire bay full of islands, surrounded by water that was a color unlike any I had ever seen. Really! My absolute favorite came at the end of the trip – the hole in the rock. Schools of shining blue fish cascaded through the waves near the mouth of the hole, as powerful waves came crashing through, creating layer upon layer of blues that went from a dark sapphire color to a glowing light blue. New Zealand, thus far, has been truly breathtaking. This looks great! I think I repel dolphins. Whenever I’ve been to places renowned for great spotting opportunities, they’re nowhere to be seen! I’m due to head to NZ soon, so maybe my luck will change… Honestly, this doesn’t seem like a bad place to get stranded :). I don’t think I would mind spending a few days alone there …Images are great, by the way! Kristin your photos reminded me of my last holiday in Kaikoura where I had the opportunity to swim with dolphins. They’re amazing creatures and I’m glad they bring back childhood memories of the California coast for you 🙂 Hi ! We recently did a write up on Hot Water Beach, didn’t see any dolphins there though! You’ve got some great pics here, truly magnificent. Your post makes us want to go back and take some proper pics, this time of these friendly guys : ) Definitely on our to do list for NZ.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-perfect-peru-itinerary/,The Perfect Peru Itinerary,Peru,"When I started planning out my Peru trip I Googled ‘Peru itinerary’ and found that I had a lot of narrowing down to do. I had no idea back then how diverse Peru is. I felt like the options were so very good and so incredibly different even though Peru is just one country. A trip there can take you through a variety of experiences, cultures, and especially climates. Within the span of one week I had gone from the mountains of Cusco to the jungles of the Amazon and then to the sand dunes of Huacachina, finishing in the capital of Lima. At no point over the past six years of my traveling have I experienced so much variety in such a short time and within the same country. So with that in mind, here’s an itinerary template with different options beginning in Lima: Chances are you’ll be flying into or out of Lima. The city doesn’t have the best reputation in terms of safety, but each time I passed through I ended up liking it more and more. I suggest staying in Baranca, a hipster neighborhood, or Miraflores, which is a seaside neighborhood with lovely Airbnbs. Check out the catacombs in the city and visit Palomino island to see the sea lions, finishing with a lovely sunset along the promenade in Miraflores. Located about five hours south of Lima by bus, this desert oasis is perfect for an overnight. Hop in a dune buggy in the late afternoon and enjoy the ride! You can either sled or sand down the dunes and finish with a lovely sunset. Bonus points if you wake up and climb the dune for sunrise. This is a tiny town without much to do other than enjoying the dunes, though it is a good jumping off point if you’d like to fly over the Nazca lines. To get there, take a bus from Lima to Ica and then a taxi to Huacachina. Read the full Huacachina guide here. You absolutely can’t go to Peru without visiting Cusco. This is the jumping off point for Machu Picchu, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world, which was a big motivating factor for you to go to Peru in the first place, amiright? The town itself is lovely with Spanish colonial architecture mixed with Incan structures. You’re also close to the Sacred Valley, the beautiful salt mines, and of course, the Inca Trail. Alternatively, you’re also close to the Salkantay and Lares trails. Be sure to acclimate in town for a few days before attempting anything too strenuous, as you’ll be pretty high up. There are some nice ruins to check out like Sacsayhuamán, markets with alpaca sweaters, lovely little coffee shops and even a few vegan restaurants. Read the full Cusco guide here. Rainbow Mountain really is rainbow-y in person! For me, this was a highlight of my Peru trip. You’ll be jumping off from Cusco and driving for three hours, taking off very early in the morning. This trail tops out at over 5000 m, so do this once you’re acclimated. Ideally, schedule it for after the Inca Trail or another trek in the area. It’s the perfect day trip to finish off your Cusco experience. Read more about how to do Rainbow Mountain the right way here. Also known as the White City, Arequipa is a colonial city framed by three volcanoes. For those who love history and architecture, the Plaza de Armas and the 17th-century neoclassical Basilica Cathedral and museum could easily take up a day on their own. This is Peru’s second most populous city and while I haven’t visited myself, I’ve heard only good things. Though I did not personally visit Lake Titicaca, it’s on the list because it’s one of the more common stops on most Peru itineraries. I’ve heard mixed reviews to be honest. Some people say that it’s quite touristy and others say that it is quite spiritual. My guess is that if you’re really looking hard for a spiritual experience, you can find it there. The lake is huge, after all. From here you can head south into Bolivia over the water. This is something I would like to try in the future. You can read more about Lake Titicaca on this blog. Though the whole country truly is beautiful, the Cordillera Blanca mountain range might be the crown jewel of Peru. It’s not nearly as popular as Cusco and Machu Picchu of course, but there are several hikes, and mountain tops, and incredible lagoons in shades of blue that are hard to believe even when you’re staring at them with your own eyes, that all make a visit worth it. I did the Laguna 69 and Santa Cruz hikes there and both were fantastic. I can’t wait to go back and do Huayhuash! Access via Huaraz from a stop in Lima. The bus ride takes 9-10 hours, which you can either do overnight or during the day. Over 60% of Peru is covered by the Amazon Rainforest, so you really can’t visit Peru and feel like you’ve seen it unless you get a taste of this jungle. For me, it was a journey I’d dreamed about ever since I was a child. During my five days staying out in an off the grid ecolodge in the jungle, I saw nine sloths, pink river dolphins, went swimming in the alkaline water which honestly felt like a day spa, and got to canoe all in and around the mangroves. If crossing in from Columbia or Ecuador, one could traverse through the Amazon to get into Peru as well. Iquitos is the perfect jumping off point for this adventure, which you will need to either boat or fly into, as no roads lead into it. You can read a lot more details about how to visit the Amazon here.  The easiest way to get around Peru is either by flying with one of the country’s regional airlines, or by taking buses. The buses in South America generally can be pretty nice with fully-reclining seats, depending on the company. Cruz del Sur is widely regarded as the best company in terms of service and the quality of the buses, though it is slightly more expensive than the rest. This is the method that I used to get from Lima to Huaraz and back. For the rest of the time, I either flew or had private transport as part of the BMTM Adventures tour. If you’re not on a tour, I recommend the methods listed above. There is also a company called Peru Hop which services backpackers with slightly nicer buses, and they make it a bit easier if your Spanish is lacking. However if you can speak even a little bit, I recommend going the independent route as it is much cheaper. You can read more about how to get around, what the accommodation and food is like, and how to stay connected in my Peru guide. Though this is by no means an exhaustive list of all of the places in Peru, it can get you started on planning the ideal itinerary. I didn’t know before going how incredibly diverse this country would turn out to be, and how interested I would be in returning again and again. Peru, I’ll be back and that’s a guarantee. Thank you for having perfect taste in travel destinations and doing so much research for us!! <3 I LOVE Peru! It’s such an amazing country – and now reading this post I’ve been reminded that I need to get back there and see so much more. I can’t wait to go back and see more too! Great article. However. Machu Picchu is not one of the seven wonders of the “ANCIENT” WORLD. Pretty sure it is a wonder of the world! Heya…awesome blog!!!!Would like to know more about the city. Lima? Which city? I’m planning a trip to Lima and Cusco for February and this was great info. I’d love to know more about off the grid adventure, the Amazon and more. Thank you! Hi there, I am planning to visit Peru next summer with my family and am starting the planning process now. We are a family of five (2 adults three teenagers 18, 16,13). We plan to do the INCA Trail and would like to what other highlights you think we should definitely see. Is two weeks too much?? The things on this list! No 2 weeks might even feel short! Hi Kristin, This is a lovely blog. Hugely helpful. We are a group of 8 looking to visit Peru in June 2020 for about 10-12 days. Have made a draft plan: 14/06/2020	Toronto – Lima15/06/2020	Lima16/06/2020	Lima-Huacachina17/06/2020	Huacachina – Lima – Cuzco18/06/2020	Cuzco19/06/2020	Machu Pichu20/06/2020	Machu Pichu21/06/2020	Rainbow Mountains & Red Valley22/06/2020	Cuzco – Lima – Huaraz23/06/2020	Huaraz – Cordillera Blanca24/06/2020	Huaraz – Lima25/06/2020	Lima – Toronto Do you think this is doable?  Also while we visit Machu Pichu, do you suggest we stay somewhere close by so that we can visit the Rainbow mountains the next day? Thanks. I’m not totally sure that you can go from Cuzco to Huaraz in one day, and also consider that the Cordillera Blanca is a large park with multiple options, all high altitude hiking. I’d consider cutting Huacachina and spending more time in Huaraz if you want to hike. You can base in Cuzco for Machu Picchu and the rainbow mountain if you find that easier. This is a lot of transit time so be ready for that! Thanks Kristin for your advice. We have changed the plan a bit. We will put up at Cuzco and cover Machu Pichu, Rainbow mountains, Red Valley and Laguna Humantay. 15/06/2020	Lima16/06/2020	Huacachina17/06/2020	Huacachina – Lima – Cuzco19/06/2020	Laguna Humantay20/06/2020	Machu Pichu21/06/2020	Machu Pichu22/06/2020	Rainbow Mountains & Red Valley23/06/2020	Cuzco – Lima Thanks again. I’m still not totally sure you can make it from Huacachina to Cusco in one day but if you found a way then go for it!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-hikes-in-peru/,The 13 Best Hikes in Peru,Peru,"When I thought of hiking in South America, my mind previously went straight to Patagonia’s glaciers and dramatic mountains. Then I visited Peru and that all changed. With it’s dramatic landscape and various regions and options for trekking, I came to realize that Peru might just be the hiking capital of South America. There are more hikes in Peru than I can even count, but incorporating my experiences and those of other bloggers who love hiking and the outdoors, these are some of the best hikes in Peru, spanning several different regions, levels of difficulty, and lengths: *Keep in mind, length can usually be altered, and difficulty is subjective. Acclimatizing is essential for all of these hikes and difficulty is assessed based on proper acclimatization and good fitness.  Though this hike is nothing short of incredible, it’s also Peru’s most popular hike and it does require permits. Here are a few essential things to remember:   “Another awesome trek that finishes at Machu Picchu is the Salkantay Trek. Though it’s not as popular as the Inca trail, it is a nice alternative if you can’t get Inca Trail permits, it’s getting more and more popular, the lower price compared to the famous Inca Trail being the main factor. We also chose this trail because it is longer, more challenging, and it can be booked last minute. After 4 days trekking through the Andes, we reached Machu Picchu on the 5th day. We’d trekked 70km in total and went through different scenery every day, from snowy mountain passes to hot and humid jungles. We took a guided tour, but the trek can be also done independently in 3 or 4 days and doesn’t require a permit. The trail itself is easy to find and well-trodden but the high altitude is an important factor to consider. It is a moderate trek through amazing landscapes with a phenomenal ending.  Most important tips for Salkantay Trek: – Maya of Travel With The Smile “The Ausangate trek near Cusco is one of our favourite treks in Peru. The scenery on the hike is incredible; colourful mountain lakes, hanging glaciers, the Rainbow mountain, green pastures with hundreds of alpacas, waterfalls, and the beautiful night sky. Ausangate is still quite off the beaten track hike compared to the more famous Inca Trail or Salkantay, except the Rainbow Mountain part which nowadays can be visited as a day trip from Cusco. The total distance is 46km, and it takes between 5 and 6 days to compete the hike. We can rate Ausangate as a moderate/difficult hike, the main difficulty is the altitude, as the whole trail is above 4000m, with two passes over 5000m, so acclimatization here is essential. We’d suggest to spend a couple of days in Cusco and maybe do another hike to get used to the altitude before starting Ausangate. We hiked Salkantay and Choquequirao beforehand. Weather can be another challenging thing on the hike it can change drastically from warm and sunny day to cold, overcast and rainy/snowy depending on the season. Best time to hike Ausangate is October – November and April when it’s relatively warm and dry. The hike can be done on your own, it’s not compulsory to have a guide, the trail is quite clear and easy to follow though we’d suggest to get a map and have a GPS backup just in case. We did the hike independently and the whole trip cost us about US$30 per person including food, transport and even some gear rentals. It’s easy to get to Tinque, the starting point of the hike, by bus from Cusco, the trip takes about 2 hours.” – Campbell and Alya from Stingy Nomads “The Huayhuash trek is located in northern Peru’s Huascarán National Park and is 180 km (112 ml) long. It’s most commonly done as a 10 day trek, but can be done from as short as 5 days to as long as 14 days. The trek is a circuit around the Huayhuash mountain range and involves crossing over 8 mountain passes. One of the peaks in the Huayhuash range is Siula Grande, featured in the movie “Touching the Void”. If you’ve seen the movie, you know how spectacular this area is. We passed numerous turquoise alpine lakes and forbidding snow-capped peaks. One for the bucket list for sure. The Huayhuash Trek is considered to be more difficult than its more popular counterpart – the Santa Cruz – since most of the walking is done at over 4000m and some of the passes are at 5000m. Doing this independently is possible, but I recommend going with a tour company (the company I went with was called The Huascaran Adventure). Due to the length and altitude involved – altitude sickness and getting caught in bad weather is a real risk. Even with donkeys carrying most of our gear, it was still one of the hardest treks we’ve done. All of our group members experienced some form of altitude sickness. Hiring guide, and getting rental equipment can be arranged from Huaraz, the nearest town where you should spend a few days acclimatizing.” – Jil of Jack and Jill Travel the World “A hike in Peru’s Colca Canyon is a great experience and should be on your Peru bucket list! The beautiful colonial town of Arequipa is the perfect base, and while there is the opportunity to do a day trip, most people explore the canyon on a two or three-day tour, giving you enough time to hike in the canyon rather than just seeing it from above. There are several tour companies offering the trip for a fair price, and in my opinion, the two-day trip is by far the best option. The hike was approx. 16 km on the first day, and 6 km on the second day. I’d describe it as medium-difficult due to the high elevation and the steep climb.  From Arequipa, it takes around 2-3 hours to reach the Colca Canyon, and you’ll be able to stop at some viewpoints, enjoying the incredible views and if you’re lucky, you’ll even spot some of the huge Andean condors. Finally, the hike into the canyon begins and you will spend your first few hours climbing down the steep and rocky trail into the canyon. While this part is quite exhausting, and you need to be careful due to the slippery rocks, the landscape in the canyon is rewarding. At the bottom, there are some local restaurants for lunch and you’ll walk further through small and local villages, crossing rivers and rocks while making your way through the canyon. There are several lodges and accommodation facilities at the bottom of the canyon, where you will spend your evening and your night. If you’re hiking in the Colca Canyon as part of a 2-day tour, you’ll have a very early wake-up call around 4-5am, to make your way up the canyon again before sunrise to avoid the heat. The hike up is very exhausting, since it’s extremely steep and depending on your level of fitness, it will take you 2-4 hours to reach the top. Afterwards, breakfast is waiting for you and most tour agencies include a few stops at a viewpoint and hot springs on the way back to Arequipa. In case you decided to go for a 3-day tour, you will spend two nights in the canyon, giving you more time to relax and to enjoy the landscape.” – Patrick from German Backpacker “Choquequirao is a 5-day trek that starts outside of Cusco and takes you to the ancient Inca ruins of Choquequirao, hidden deep in the Apurimac Valley. These ruins are often described as the “little sister of Machu Picchu”, although many archeologists suspect that the total size of Choquequirao is actually significantly larger than the ruins of Machu Picchu. However, at present day, over 70% of Choquequirao has not yet been excavated. The trail to and from Choquequirao spans over 60 kms and the hike to the ruins is considered to be technical and challenging. Due to the daily altitude changes of up to 1,000-1,500, days are long and strenuous, but luckily the views along the way make up for the fitness challenge. The ruins themselves are impressive and well preserved. They may not be as well known as Machu Picchu, but they certainly are worth a visit. While it is possible to undertake the hike to Choquequirao on your own, we highly recommend doing it with a responsible tour provider, like Apus Peru. The local guides and porters from Apus Peru made our experience on the trek that much more enjoyable, taking our focus away from carrying supplies and worrying about cooking meals and allowed us to fully immerse ourselves in the scenery and enjoy the experience.” – Oksana & Max from Drink Tea Travel  “Most people who visit Peru typically hike the Colca Canyon and venture to do the Inca Trail, so the majority of travelers don’t know where Marcahuasi is. To be fair, not even many locals do. Marcahuasi, located at 4000 meters above sea level, is a hybrid between a natural site (with rock formations resembling face shapes of both humans and animals) and an archaeological site. It can be reached via a strenuous walk from San Pedro de Casta, a tiny village located around 100 km from Lima and sitting at 3000 meters above sea level. The trip to San Pedro de Casta is in and of itself an adventure: Factor in around 5 hours to cover the short distance, and a mixture of a cab ride to reach the bus/colectivo stop to catch the bus to Chosica from where buses leave to San Pedro de Casta. The trip usually lasts about 3 hours along the side of a mountain and with incredible cliffs that make the view and the overall trip literally breathtaking. Though buses leave every day from Chosica to San Pedro, the same can’t be said for the buses back. They are supposed to leave every day at 2:00 pm, but in fact they leave just about whenever. This means that those who plan to hike Marcahuasi should count it as a 2 to 3 day trip as a minimum and consider spending the night in San Pedro de Casta, unless they have their own cars. Once in San Pedro de Casta, visitors have to register themselves in the tourism office, located in the main square. It is impossible to miss it: the village receives such few visitors (no more than one or two per week) that they are immediately identified and welcomed by the locals. The woman at the tourism office typically walks visitors to the only hotel, a very modest “hospedaje municipal” which has private rooms with or without bathrooms (but no hot water) for no more than $6 USD per person. As it gets very cold at night, make sure to carry enough warm clothes and a sleeping bag too. The hotel provides blankets.  The actual hike can be done independently. It leaves from the village and follows a well marked trail. It takes between 6 and 8 hours to complete the trail. It is best to plan to leave right after sunrise, as it typically starts raining around 1:00 pm. There are no shops along the way, so make sure to carry plenty of water and snacks for the hike. The hike itself (around 12 km round trip) is rather strenuous due to the high altitude. It’s possible to get horses in San Pedro de Casta. On the way up, the views of the mountains are spectacular. Marcahuasi itself is a beautiful site, where silence rules – making the place rather eerie.” – Claudia of My Adventures Across the World “This little-known Inca Trail hike between Chinchero and Urquillos is short, steep and stunning. Taking about 4 hours, the 8 km route passes through an impressive variety of landscapes and although it is downhill nearly all the way, don’t be fooled into thinking it will be easy. The relentless gradient is punishing on this moderately graded hike, but the scenery is more than worth the effort. You don’t need a guide but if you want to really understand the environment you’re walking through, we do recommend it. We hired one through our accommodation near Urubamba, and were glad we did. The trail begins in the Andean village of Chinchero, just 30 km north east of Cusco. Famous for its traditional weaving culture, Chinchero is also known as the birthplace of the rainbow! Just outside the village, the path traverses magnificent Incan agricultural terraces, which are still in use today. It feels rather like walking back through history, and we had it all to ourselves! Flanked by waterfalls and functioning Incan irrigation channels, the trail winds its way down into the Sacred Valley, passing through misty valleys, dramatic gorges and peaceful eucalyptus forests. Lone farmers tend to small pockets of cultivated land, and on our hike we often stopped for a friendly exchange of waves and nods. About halfway down the trail there’s an opportunity to scramble down to view some waterfalls. The path however is incredibly steep, and coming back up is a bit of a challenge. Having a head for heights is obligatory. Back on the main trail, the gorge is now at its most dramatic, with plunging mountainsides, distant views of snow-capped Andean peaks, and eagles soaring high overhead as you continue down to the sleepy hamlet of Urquillos and the end of the trail. The hike makes a perfect day trip from Cusco, and can be combined with a visit to the weaving collectives in Chinchero, or even a trip to Pisac.” – Heather of Conversant Traveller “The Trek Gran Vilaya, located in Cordillera Central, is one of my favorite treks in Peru – I have done a lot in that country! Because it combines great landscapes, history, and adventure, it is usually called the Inca Trail of the North (but it costs half price). The ruins here are the main sights of the Chapapoyas, warriors who controlled this area from AD500 until their defeat by the Incan Empire in the 15th century. The Trek Gran Vilaya (4 days and 3 nights) is a mystical trek through the jungle, beautiful valleys, lost citadels (some of them still to be discovered), great panoramas, and welcoming local people. The journey starts in the colonial city of Chachapoyas where you can book the trek with a local company. When we did this trek in 2015 it was not well known yet so there were only 2-3 companies offering it, all located in Plaza de Armas. The funny thing is that all these companies were working with the same guide so regardless of who we booked with, Roger would be the guide. During the 4 days we walked an average of 6-7 hours per day, sometimes with steep inclines over 1400 m and descending 1000 m. We had the opportunity to visit some great Chachapoya sites like the watching warriors sarcophagi in Karaija, or the citadels of Pirquilla and Lanche, the latest uncovered from the jungle only 3 years ago. The last day was spent visiting Kuelap, Chachapoya’s main citadel and center of their power.” – Elisa of World in Paris  Huayna Picchu is the mountain that you see behind Machu Picchu in most photos, though most people who visit have no idea that you can actually climb this one as well! It requires a separate, rather expensive $50 permit, however it gives you an insane overview over Machu Picchu, pictured above. The hike is steep, up relentless stairs, however it’s only about an hour or two to the top and is easy to tack onto the end of the Inca Trail if you’ve still got the energy. Book the permit well in advance as this one sells out! Spanning many areas of the country over several mountain ranges, those are our favorite hikes in Peru. Ranging from just a few hours to over a week, these hikes each have their own unique beauty and reasons for doing them. Peru, you sure are beautiful! I envy all those people who can do those gorgeous hikes! I would really have to train more to be able to attempt even the moderately easy ones. I’m looking forward to my trip to Peru next week, but I only have hikes planned around the Colca Canyon 🙂 Hi BMTM Team!What a great list you have compiled and it is also so neat how you brought together fellow travel bloggers from all over to contribute. In the end everyone has their specific focus and interest within traveling and are part of one community often with similar goals. The cooperation is great. Clearly when you chose Peru as your first tour, you did your research (like always) and found a true gem. Thing that is almost scary is after reading this blog for a while, there is an urgency to start traveling more because you need time to explore the nearly infinite choices you have around this beautiful planet we live in (both the people (at least most of them!) and nature). One question for you, Kristin. When you go back to Peru, what place would you consider next that you have never been to?  I think it is nice that there are still less known places which are pretty much as nice as the one “popular spot”. And the ones where they are still excavating is really cool because I am into archaeological stuff. Noooo this means I’m gonna have to spend like 2 months in Peru if I don’t want to leave any of these hikes out! Luckily it’s an affordable country XD Marcahuasi altitude 4000 within one day from Lima is mission impossible. Pretty cool that you put this out there for folks.  I did most of those in 2001, and 2005/6.  I’m curious about the Pirquilla/ Lanche being “uncovered” three years from your posting.  I saw them in 2005 and 2006.  And it might be cool for folks that you reach to know about Gocta, which back when I saw it didn’t even have a trail leading to it.  Anyway, nice job on the tour treks advice!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/santa-cruz-trek/,10 Things to Know about the Santa Cruz Trek in Peru Without a Guide,Peru,"Back in October while scrolling through Instagram, I landed on a photo of the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in Peru and was instantly hooked. The lake looked so blue, and the mountains so dramatically-shaped and snow-capped. It looked like Peru’s version of Patagonia. When I researched it more, given my time constraints, the 4-day Santa Cruz trek out of Huaraz looked like the perfect way to see the best of it. When I first started planning my Santa Cruz trekking experience I knew that I wanted to do it on my own. As fun as it can be hanging out with a group, there’s something wonderful about packing up your own bag and going at your own speed through the mountains. You get to make all of your own decisions and it’s possible to get a lot more solitude on an otherwise very popular trail. I found plenty of blogs and websites online before I started the hike myself, but most of them left out incredibly important information or even made irresponsible suggestions. After having a gorgeous and issue-free hike on the Santa Cruz trek myself, these are all of the things I learned about having the best possible experience out there:  If you’re still weighing the options, these are the pros and cons of doing the trek with a group versus independently: But in case you didn’t – surprise! The highest point of the trail is at 4750 meters (about 15,583 feet!), and most of the trail, particularly the hard parts, takes place over 4000 meters. If you’re considering doing this trek independently, this probably isn’t your first rodeo, but still, don’t take the altitude lightly. Give yourself plenty of time to acclimate in Huaraz before you go, do preparatory treks like the Laguna 69 first to see how you do, prepare to be out there for an extra day if need be, and don’t go if you don’t feel well. Some people advise taking medication for the altitude. I have personally never done this, even while hiking the Annapurna circuit in Nepal and Rainbow Mountain outside of Cusco, both of which are higher. Everyone has to decide this for themselves, but I personally want my body to be able to communicate with me, and the side effects are dehydration and sensitivity to sunlight, both of which are incredibly unhelpful at altitude! To be completely honest, I had no problems whatsoever with the altitude. I took 3 days/4 nights in Huaraz to acclimate, hiked Laguna 69 the day before, and drank plenty of water all along the trail. While I know that everyone is different and a lot of people struggle on this trail, the biggest reason is not giving themselves enough time to acclimate. I wrote this list as I packed so that I couldn’t possibly leave anything out of this blog post. Here’s everything I brought: I decided to err on the side of caution and bring enough food for four nights in case I had issues on the trail with altitude and needed to take it slower. This made my pack a bit heavier but I think it’s worth it to be prepared for a worst-case scenario when you’re trekking independently. If shopping in Huaraz, I recommend the Novaplaza for one-stop shopping, although if you’re a kind soul who wants to support the small guys too, buy your candy bars and dried fruits at the smaller markets: I brought my own gear with the exception of the cooking equipment and tent. I do wish I’d had my own tent. You never really know if you got a leaky one until it’s too late, which unfortunately for me, meant drying out my tent every afternoon: I always just bring one set of clothes for hiking in, and one for sleeping in, with enough undies and extra socks. Keep the weight down!   My story of getting there was interesting, and will also prove informative: After quickly packing up and leaving my hostel the first morning of my planned trek, I realized that every blog I’d read, and my map, advised getting a collectivo in Huaraz (combi taxi) but failed to mention where that happened. I walked around town in the dark, bound for the center, figuring that must be the right track. A couple of locals I asked saw an opportunity and suggested I take an expensive taxi, claiming that the last collectivo left at 4am. This is false. A kind soul overheard and walked up next to me and quietly said, ‘three more blocks.’ Thankfully, just as the clock hit 5:30 I saw a collection of collectivos and asked at the first one, ‘Yungay?’ The driver briskly nodded a quarter of a centimeter and started rolling forward. I jumped in and marked down the spot where I found him – it’s here you’d probably like to know. It costs 5 soles, and not an extra 3 for your bag like the guy tried with me. (I gave him a quick, ‘bruh, nah,’ and he dropped it). For the next hour and a half we regularly pulled over to pick up and drop off passengers. I made it to Yungay close to 7am and was immediately greeted by an enthusiastic driver who beamed, ‘Vaqueria?’ and escorted me to his van. He knew why I was there. This ride should cost 20 soles and he will stop at the park entrance for you to buy your 60 sole-ticket. Go for the 3-day one, they only check your ticket once at the beginning. The drive was the most terrifyingly beautiful of my life. The pass was snowed in, and I was pretty sure that beat up old van didn’t have winter tires, if they even had tread. Two sharp curves had snow so deep he got stuck, backed up on a blind curve with no railing and a bunch of crosses (others who didn’t make it on that curve) and made it on the third try. I tried not to pee my pants. To get back out, you’ll hike to Cashapampa where a collectivo picks up right at the end of the trail, bound for Caraz. This should cost 10 soles and chances are good you’ll be in a sedan packed with 8 people – no joke. The drive from Caraz to Huaraz should cost 5-6.50 soles. For the most part, the trail is obvious although it does branch in some parts and you need to know when to be looking for a fork in the trail and what to do if you get to the higher elevations and the trail is covered in snow. It is helpful to have a waterproof topographical map. Anything else will just disintegrate. I bought mine at Quechuandes and thought it was great to get a sense of the elevation gain and loss and to know when to anticipate the forks in the trail. However I did not follow the exact route they suggested. I highly suggest downloading the route on the maps.me app as well. Not only will it help you out when you have deviated from the trail, it has all of the other campsites listed on it that the tour groups do not camp at. This was incredibly useful for me to avoid having to ever share my campground with anyone else. It was awesome. This is my suggested route: If you’re a fast hiker and experienced with backpacking, feeling good, and you make it to Alpamayo Base Camp on day two, it’s possible to combine days three and four and finish the trek in 3 days. I would still go into it planning on 4-5 days just in case. If I had it to do over again I’d still begin in Vaqueria. Difficulty is hard to measure, because it’s subjective, however I feel this hike would be moderately easy at sea level, and moderate at altitude with weight. That said, multiple accounts I read online rated it as moderate to difficult. The trail is nowhere near the steepest I’ve experienced. If you’ve hiked in Patagonia, it’s much less steep than Fitz Roy and overall, easier than Torres del Paine, however both of those are low-elevation hikes, and altitude is a major factor. If you’re properly acclimated and you hike often, this should be fine for you. If not, it will be challenging. I’m a photography buff, which means a lot more weight on my back, but I can’t imagine going without taking tons of photos and video! It would pain me. So if you’re like me, I suggest the following: Nearly 3000 words later, that’s everything I learned while solo and independently hiking the Santa Cruz trek in the Cordillera Blanca mountains in Peru’s Huascaran National Park. I’d been told it was one of the most beautiful trails in the world and, though it has some really tough competition in my book, it was one of the nicest trails I’ve done. I highly recommend it both for the challenge of hiking at altitude and for the gorgeous views and laguna after stunning laguna. I learned about so many more lakes and trails while I was there, so watch this space, because I’ll be going back! Happy hiking! I hope this helps you to plan an epic Santa Cruz adventure. Hey Kristin: You clearly have put so much work into this post and it shows. So detailed and complete. This whole thing sounds very involved and some smart dealing with transportation so thanks for the details.I think this trek is so cool for the reasons you stated plus:1. How often can you experience snow near the equator, in May no less!!!??? (okay it is 9 degrees S, but close enough!)2. While the weather affected views and it was muddy, I think it was really neat to see you cross the rain/snow line. It was also cool how it was raining where you are at one point and look up and literally see where the snow begins! These abrupt changes are fascinating (including when you go past the tree line). In addition, I love how you mention the “Leave No Trace” principle and program, so respectful! It is so important that everyone do this. I encourage everyone to watch the video here, she adds a great personal touch on it!  Thanks goodness that snowy drive on the edge went okay! You are brave! I wasn’t even thinking about how close we were to the equator. Makes sense that at sea level around Lima it’s a sandy desert!  Leave no trace is SUPER important to me. I see a lot of people washing dishes directly in rivers or leaving behind TP and I think they just don’t realize it’s a no-no.  If you’re REALLY going for leave no trace you drink the grey water too, so since I don’t do that I’ll step off my high horse now. No worries Kristin! If everyone does a little to keep the environment clean it would make a world of difference and you already do a lot! You are a good role model in this and so glad it is important to you. BTW to dispose of your grey water if you have a strainer you definitely don’t have to drink it to follow Leave No Trace (and even if you don’t have a strainer there are some options, although you could if you wanted to if there is no soap in it)!  🙂  Maybe one day you can do a post focusing specifically on environmental stewardship when traveling…limiting your carbon footprint if you haven’t already done so (or have it in your books)! I love all your DIY hiking guides!! This sounds amazing, beautiful, every superlative in the book. I agree 100% I would never want to do a hike like this with a tour group if the possibility exists to do it independently. Imagine having to share that beauty and peace with dozens of other people. Thank you so much for this and the Laguna 69 guide and literally everything you’ve written about Peru; Peru has gone way up my destinations list! Yay glad you liked what you read! I tend to really like hiking independently too. However on the Inca Trail I have to admit having a luxurious tent that was set up for me and having all the cooking done for me too was awesome. Oh man, it looked really wet up there at Punta Union – I would have been miserable trudging up with a heavy pack like yours.  Your guide is spot on and brings back such great memories of being there. I considered hiking solo but chickened out and joined a group instead because I’ve never camped solo (always with a friend who knew what he/she was doing). It wasn’t as tough as I expected and I wished I did it independently after all. After reading your guide I’m convinced I need to get my shit together and just go on a camping and hiking trip solo soon.  Random question: what daypack were you using for your Laguna 69 hike? Next time you go with a friend, be the one who sets up the tent and the stove and let them correct you if you get something wrong so that you’ll feel empowered enough to do it solo. I had to learn from someone else too, which was a beautiful thing! For Laguna 69 I had a waterproof Kathmandu backpack a friend gifted me 🙂 Thanks for the tip 🙂 And shall check out Kathmandu… What a great post! I don’t see myself ever tackling a hike like this – well.. maybe I shouldn’t say never but I don’t see it happening anytime soon – but I still enjoy reading about it 🙂 Thanks for all the information, it’s so useful! I’m going to Peru in september and would love to do the Santa Cruz trek independently. The thing is.. I’m not that experienced when it comes to solo camping/trekking. What would you suggest? If you’ve backpacked before several times and completely know what you’re doing, and you feel totally comfortable going it alone, then it’s something to consider. However the tours really aren’t that expensive and they take care of everything for you. It’s hard for me to tell you it’s a good or bad idea but I think you should at least have trekked and camped several times and know how to navigate before attempting it solo. Solo trekking has a lot more dangers associated with it for sure, and you want to be safe and happy! Hey Kristin, i’ve just got back from this hike. Thank you for the this article. I could see how much effort was spent on. Your tips and advices were precious and made my hike 10 times better.  God bless you. Yay that makes me so happy! Hi Kristin, I’m thinking about doing this hike solo so this article is very informative and I’m happy i’ve read it. But i’m new with backpacking so a little scared to get lost. I’ve downloaded the app maps.me and downloaded peru but can’t seem to find the trail nor find campsites in this region. Am i doing something wrong or missing something? Also, where did you get your peruvian sol? I was able to find the entire route but had to zoom in to see the campsites. It took me a little time before I found it too. Input the pass and work backwards from there. I obtain Sol through the ATMs.  If you’re feeling unsure the tours are not expensive at all, and it might be a good idea to join one! thank you!very inspiring AND useful!i’ll start the trek tomorrow.. andy Sweet have fun! Hi Kristin,  I just read online “According to Huascaran National Park’s latest regulations, some trekking circuits, the Santa Cruz trek route in particular, are no longer open to independent travelers and can be done only through a tour operator or travel agency accredited by Huascaran National Park.”  After further research I’ve found similar references in web forums from up to 8 years ago. Though this info might be entirely made up by those involved in guiding business in Huascaran. I’ve reached out to some contacts listed on official national park website but haven’t heard back from anyone yet.  Wondering if you encountered anyone saying you can’t go on your own. You mentioned in your post that bought the park ticket at the entry so assuming they would probably mentioned something if there was such a regulation. Which year did you go there? Thanks! Hm, where did you read that? Was it on an official park website? This is totally new info to me. Nobody at the park HQ tried to discourage me from going solo nor did the rangers I met along the way. This was in May of 2018, not even a year ago. That’s good know. Thanks for sharing.  Hi KristinWe are doing this hike mid August after doing Salkantay Trek. We are experienced hikers and we’re going to do it in 2 days 1 night. We were going to stay closer to the start and leave earlier. Do you think this is possible? How many k’s did you do each day? That’s what is always left out when I’m reading things.  I did enjoy your read, very helpful and I feel even more comfortable with the shorter hike.Di I’ve gotta advise you against that. It’s a 50km trek but remember you’re at super high altitude so it’s much tougher and it’s steep in parts. If you manage it in 2 days great but at least allow yourself the possibility of longer. I’m a pretty fit and experienced hiker too and the shortest I could’ve done would be 2d/3n. You’d probably have to skip the glacier lake and never stop for photos. Give it more time and enjoy it! Hi Kristin, This august i’m planning to do the hike. Still doubting on doing it alone or not.Do you have an indication on the price of the gear and wear to buy/rent it. (tent, trekking poles, sleepingmat, cooking gear)Do you know if guided tours include this?Last question: where was the best place to book your tour?Thanks in advance, your guide is great btw! regards,Maarten Hi Maarten, you could ask at Trekandes, otherwise I would just ask many places and go with the lowest quote. Since I didn’t take a tour I didn’t really get the info on that, but they are more or less the same. They would provide the gear if you were to go with a guided tour, so if you really need to rent everything, it honestly might be cheaper to do a tour. Hi Kristin!!!!  Congratulations!! Great Website!  I am planning to do the Santa Cruz trek and I wonder if you know if nowadays a guide is mandatory to do the trek (there is a lot of contradicting information).  In some forums they say that they won´t sale you a ticket in Huaraz unless you are going with a guide, but that they will sell you the ticket at the park entrance. I am a little worry to get to the park entrance with my backpack and not be allowed to get into the park without a guide. Do you have any information? If a guide is mandatory I rather go trekking somewhere else. Thanks! I didn’t even know that you could buy a ticket in Huaraz and nobody told me I had to have a guide. Have you been to Quechandes? That’s where I got my . map and I liked the woman there for suggestions. She didn’t even try to upsell me on a tour. Hi there  Do you know if there is WiFi or reception along the trek There is no reception and no buildings or lodges for WiFi. It’s all camping.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hiking-laguna-69/,Laguna 69 in Peru: An Easy Hiking Guide,Peru,"Picture this: You round a bend after a few hours of grueling hiking in thin air and suddenly the fatigue melts away, replaced with exuberance, because you’re gazing at a dazzling blue lake, bluer than you’ve ever seen before. But that’s not all, there’s a small waterfall trickling down into it from a massive glacier, creating one of the most magnificent panoramas in Peru, if not all of planet Earth. Laguna 69 is impressive to say the least. It’s easy to understand why it’s right at the top of the list for most people visiting Huaraz in Peru. It can be an incredible experience, but it’s not to be taken lightly. Logistics and especially the altitude can present significant challenges if you’re not prepared. The following will help you have a more enjoyable experience hiking to Laguna 69: First off, Laguna 69 got its name because it’s one of several hundred lakes in the area and they didn’t come up with anything better. I absolutely had to know and I figured you did, too. Moving on… Though it’s hard to rate a hike’s difficulty or intensity since such things are subjective, I would personally rate the hike as moderate, though if not at altitude, it would be easy for someone who hikes regularly. The trail is gradual and there are no super steep parts, though you will gain 758 meters over 6 kilometers (≈ 2490 feet over 3.7 miles). I always say the best way to prepare for any particular sport is by doing that exact sport. In order to prep for the Laguna 69 hike, do another hike in the area beforehand that is lower in elevation. The Laguna Wilcacocha is a popular one because it’s easy to get to and tops out under 4000 m. Though not spectacular, it’s a pleasant hike that helps you get ready for the main event. Laguna 69 rests at 4600 m (just over 15,000 feet) in elevation. To put this into perspective, Denver’s Mile High Stadium is only at 1600 m and Everest base camp is just slightly above 5300. If you’ve hiked at altitude before, then you will know that what might have been easy at sea level can be infinitely more difficult when the air is thin. It’s no fun hiking with a pounding headache while struggling to breathe. What’s more, altitude sickness can be quite serious and threatening. The only way to combat it is by properly acclimating first — that’s ‘acclimatizing’ for the non-North Americans out there ?– and that just requires time. Generally fitness levels don’t matter, and how you might have fared in the altitude previously doesn’t have much bearing on how it will be for you this time. I would advise leaving at least two days in Huaraz, at 3052 m, to get used to the altitude before attempting Laguna 69. Some people advise taking medication for the altitude. I have personally never done this, even while hiking the Annapurna circuit in Nepal and Rainbow Mountain outside of Cusco, both of which are higher. Everyone has to decide this for themselves, but I personally want my body to be able to communicate with me, and the side effects are dehydration and sensitivity to sunlight, both of which are incredibly unhelpful at altitude! Drink coca leaf tea, avoid alcohol and caffeine, and give your body the time it needs. I’m a big fan of doing things the independent way when it makes sense to, but for Laguna 69 it just doesn’t. It is easy enough to get a collectivo, or combi taxi, from Huaraz to the start of the trail via Yungay, However getting back can be problematic. There are rarely collectivos heading back in the afternoon, and if you have to negotiate your way onto a tour bus anyway, you might as well just take one from the beginning. The only reason to take the tour is for the transport. Sadly you won’t have a guide stopping and explaining things. He doesn’t serve much of a purpose other than making sure the people at the end of the pack get back to the bus in time. The point is really just to make sure that you’ll be able to get back home at the end of it. Everyone in town is selling the same exact tour to Laguna 69. There is no reason to pay more than 35 soles for it. I bought mine through my guest house for 40, however I found out later that Quechuandes sells it for 35. I recommend them for all of your trekking needs – they were super helpful when I asked for advice on trekking Santa Cruz independently (but more on that in the next post). The bus will pick you up at your accommodation between 5 and 5:30 in the morning. The drive to the start of the trail takes about three hours, and will include a breakfast stop. Meals are available for 15 soles each. They looked pretty good, but I brought some leftover pizza from the night before so I passed. They allow three hours up, one hour at the Laguna, and two hours back down. You will get back to your accommodation at around 6 PM, give or take 30 minutes. If you’d like to avoid a tour, it’s possible to book a car in town that will bring you to the start of the trail and will wait until you are finished. I heard the going rate is around 180 soles, which is perfect if you have a big enough group for it to make sense. Your accommodation would probably be happy to book this for you. None of the above includes entrance to Huascaran National Park, which costs 30 soles. *If you plan on hiking Santa Cruz after, the ticketing prices have changed and it is no longer more economical to get a 21-day ticket, which doesn’t even exist anymore. Buy 1 day for Laguna 69 for 30 soles and the 3-day for Santa Cruz for 60, even if you plan on being on the trail for four days. I’ll explain more in the Santa Cruz post. Watch the video of the trek here: As mentioned in the previous section, I brought along food for the trail. Your only opportunity to buy refreshments will be at the breakfast stop, so it’s imperative that you bring along snacks for the trail. There’s plenty of water running along most of the trail, however there is also plenty of livestock, so it would be wise to sterilize it. I use a SteriPEN for this, though you could also use chemical tablets. I also brought along hiking poles. I find that they are very helpful. I didn’t notice many other people with them but they sure help me! Be sure to bring waterproof layers as well. You never know what kind of weather you might encounter. Though it was a clear and sunny day when I went in early May, the very next day it was snowing in the same spot! Finally, bring a way to protect your face and skin from the sun. Another unfortunate drawback of hiking in altitude is the thin air providing very little barrier from the sun. I also insure myself with a travel insurance that covers adventurous activities like hiking, because you simply never know! It’s always better to be prepared for the worst while allowing for the best. And Laguna 69 sure is the best, or at least amongst the very best in Peru’s Cordillera Blanca range. I hope this helped you to plan out your Laguna 69 adventure with ease. I used this hike as an acclimation hike for the Santa Cruz trek, a 4-day trail that I set out on solo and independently the following day. Funny thing, Laguna 69 to me is kind of a catchy name and it is certainly easier to pronounce :). Thanks for describing and also providing a nice video of the experience hiking at such altitude (and the  bull imitation, worked at a measurement site in a cow pasture for two years, he seemed to miss having company! 🙂 ). It was one of my biggest questions when I started following you (the elevation, not the bull 🙂 ) and I really have an appreciation and can tell from the video how exhausting it can be. It reminds me of a time I wanted to run in crisp, mountain air thinking I was in great shape and all (and lived at sea level at the time) and after 1 mile sprint thought I was going to collapse! Speaking of Denver and Colorado, one of my favorite places was Pike’s Peak (went when it wasn’t crowded which can be a challenge!) with the speak climb/rise.  We were driven up (it was a little nerve wracking, there were no railings along the edge in spots and the road was narrow, and of course the driver was going too fast) and hung out at the top for about an hour and you could feel the difference even acclimated to 1 mile elevation.  I liked that location because you could see the change in climates and the change from having any trees to nothing but rocks was so sharp! It is a 13.5 mile (21.7 km) hike with a ~7400 foot (2250+ meter) rise so a big challenge if you want to try it. It is in the back of my mind to do one day because the views as you go up this steep rise are breathtaking, but I will have to follow your recommendations of building up to it with smaller rises first.BTW, Kristin, I did not think it was possible, but your pictures are amazing and the best yet in terms of quality! You also seem to have the artistic knack for getting the angels and colors just right (it helps Peru is gorgeous too!). Thanks for the kind words and the hiking recommendation! Wow, the lake looks beautiful! I don’t think I would be able to tackle this hike since I’m not yet a seasoned hiker, but one can dream & train & dream some more 🙂 Hi  there,  Could you please tell me what drone you are using to make this beautiful videos? That was a mavic pro 🙂 Hey Kristin, Love your blog, I’m planning my trip to Peru and I’ve been reading everything you wrote about it : useful and very well written !Quick question for you : if one wants to start the Santa-Cruz trek the day after (as you did, if I’m not wrong) do you think it’s possible to hike the Laguna 69 independently, camp somewhere near the starting point and take a colectivo for Vaqueria the morning after ? It would be nice to avoid coming back and forth from Huaraz twice. Matteo Hmm, I’m not sure on the camping. There might be a campsite at the start of laguna 69 if I recall correctly, and I’ve seen photos of people camping right on it, too. It would be ideal to get onward transport to vaqueria but most collectivos aren’t heading that way anymore by the time you’d be finishing up.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/peru-packing-list/,The Perfect Peru Packing List,Peru,"I learned a little something interesting when I set out to pack for my month-long trip to Peru: Depending on which source you’re quoting, Peru has 30 of 32 world climates. If you want to see a nice variety of the country during your travels in Peru, it will be like trying to pack for a trip to the USA including both Hawaii and Alaska, a big city like Los Angeles, and the deserts of the American Southwest, all in the same trip. That certainly makes packing light for Peru a challenge, especially if you do plan to visit the mountains, like Cusco, the Amazon jungle, Lima, and the sand dunes of Huacachina. I was able to fit everything that I needed, including a sleeping bag and other camping gear, into a 75 L backpack, which was under standard airline weight limits though still not ideal. However you could cut down a lot if you don’t plan on bringing your own camping gear like I did. The key is in bringing layers and wardrobe pieces that serve multiple purposes. With that in mind, this is my perfect Peru packing list: The highlands include any of the mountain areas, like Machu Picchu and any of the hikes leading to it such as the Inca Trail, Cusco itself, the Cordillera mountains, Lake Titicaca, and so on. Chances are if you’re visiting Peru you’re heading somewhere high up, and that means it will be cold. Bring the following: If you’re doing some unassisted trekking, you’ll want to bring along additional gear like trekking poles, a tent, sleeping bag, etc. However you can almost always find a reasonably-priced supported trek with gear, guides, and porters, or you can rent gear. The Amazon jungle is hot, humid, and in almost every way, the opposite climate of the mountains and highlands. However, you can reuse the cargo pants and the lightweight shirts from the previous section, and add just a few lightweight extras: In sharp contrast to the climates mentioned above, Lima and Huacachina are dry deserts, which receive very little rain and can get quite hot. I also tend to want to wear non-trekking clothes when I’m in cities. I blend in more and just feel more comfortable. To make that work, I brought a couple of things just for this region: Though Peru not easy to pack for, it’s doable if you bring the multi-purpose items mentioned above. You’ll also have many opportunities to buy cool things like the rainbow poncho pictured above, beanies, sweaters, scarves, and gloves made out of wool and even alpaca once you arrive in Peru. If you possibly can, leave some room for a little sweater adorned in llamas to bring back home with you. Prices will vary depending on the material and whether you buy off of the sidewalk or in a higher-end shop. Generally, you can haggle the price down. I paid $12 for the rainbow poncho in the photo. I hope that helps to make packing for your adventure easier. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments! *Some links in this post are affiliate links, which help support this site at no extra cost whatsoever to you. I only recommend products and services I use myself. Your trust always comes first! Thank you! This will be most useful for when I finally go, which will hopefully be soon! Super useful! Why isn’t Peru talked about more?? Something for everybody, cheap prices, and easy and affordable to fly to from the US? Sounds like a major vacation destination waiting to happen I meet a lot of people from the States in South American in general as compared to other parts of the world. Makes sense though for all of the reasons you just stated! Great tips and at the perfect time! I’m travelling to Peru in two weeks so this list comes in handy 🙂 Fantastic! Thanks so much for your list.  Packing for Peru as we speak. packing has always been a challenge to most women, myself included, travelling to peru seems so easy. thanks for sharing. Thank you for this article. Hubby and I are off to Peru in September and have chosen to take many of the items you mention. I was worried about the cold as I don’t want to take too much so it’s good to hear that you can buy woollen items there. Yeah there are lots of sweaters, especially in Cusco! Is there much of a price difference on wool items in Cusco compared to the U.S.? Yes I think so. Thank you for this article! It is very inspiring! Just one question, would you recommend bringing or renting camping gear (tent, sleeping pad and sleeping bag)? I already own quality ultralight gear but I don’t know if its worth lugging around the whole country when I wont be trekking. I had the same debate. In the end I brought my own sleeping bag and pad but rented a tent and cooking equipment. Even though I set up the tent at the rental place to make sure there were no major issues, you still won’t be able to detect leaks until they happen, which they did. In the moment I vowed never to rent a tent again.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/amazon-peru/,The Best Way to Visit the Amazon in Peru,Peru,"Ever since I was a kid, logging hours upon hours on the Amazon Trail video game (anyone else play that?), I’ve been obsessed with the idea of visiting the Amazon jungle to see it with my own eyes. Now I’ve been to jungles before, but nowhere had been this vast, remote, and unreachable by typical means. First, we flew into Iquitos, Peru, the largest city in the world without any roads leading to it, and took a speed boat for another two hours down the Amazon river to reach our ecolodge. I didn’t just want to be on the outskirts for this experience, I wanted to head deep into the jungle, off the grid, for the ultimate Amazon, Peru experience. The Amazon is the largest tropical jungle in the world spread out over nine countries in South America.The Peruvian Amazon covers more than 60% of the country and is one of the most biologically diverse regions on planet Earth, with Peru as a nation containing the largest number of bird species and the third-largest number of mammalian species in the world. Want to experience it for yourself? These are the things to know:  Considering how much of the country is covered in the Amazon jungle in Peru, how will you know what to choose? There are two distinct regions of the Amazon in Peru: The lowland and the highland jungle. The highland jungle reaches into the foothills of the Andes and offers both warmer and cooler temperatures, plus a great deal of biodiversity. I wanted to be super deep in the jungle rather than along the outskirts and therefore headed to the lowland jungle with my BMTM Adventures group, and I flew into Iquitos first (which I don’t recommend staying in – it’s a city) before taking a boat further into the forest to the Tamshiyacu Tahuayo Regional Conservation Area. We chose this since there is no malaria or Zika in this part of the jungle, and because of the Tahuayo Ecolodge which does conservation in the area, contributes to the local communities with clinics and schools, and respects the environment. Plus, they had the top-rated ecolodge in the area. Bird and monkey sightings in the jungle are common, as are sloths and river dolphins, at least during the season that I was there (April, which is in the rainy season). We got lucky and saw nine sloths in one day, plus went swimming with pink river dolphins! That said, these animals aren’t habituated like the Gorillas in Uganda or the Orangutans in Sumatra. You’re not in a small area like the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater. The lodge we stayed at doesn’t feed the animals, which is great because otherwise I wouldn’t have wanted to stay there, but that does mean that any animal sighting comes down to luck and timing. The animals are shy and would rather not be spotted easily. I say this just to manage expectations. Bring binoculars and get excited when you do see these truly wild animals! Perhaps this point sounds obvious but what I mean is you will be deep, deep in the jungle. There is no electricity, 4G signal, roads, or power lines. This was the point for me – I wanted the full experience and to forget about the outside world. However this also meant that everything in the lodge I stayed in was solar-powered. There wasn’t enough juice for us to have fans or air conditioning running. There was WiFi, but it didn’t really work (I didn’t actually try it but everyone who did reported this to be fact), and there were many mosquitoes. I’d asked for it, I’d gone into their house, but I wasn’t as prepared as I should have been for the amount I encountered. Next time I’m bringing a mosquito jacket onesie so that I can fully enjoy the jungle treks. It doesn’t look pretty but it will give you a chance to be totally in the jungle without worrying about bites if you’re a mosquito magnet like I am. Most lodges come as a package deal that includes your meals, lodging, transport, and activities. Each day, we had 2-3 activities that we could choose from that included searching for poison dart frogs in the jungle, zip-lining in the canopy, learning how to do weaving with women from the local village, bird watching, night hikes, dolphin cruises down the river, cultural visits to the village where we played soccer with the locals, fishing, and more that I’m probably forgetting. I was also really impressed by the food at our lodge, which had fresh veggies every day and a variety of meat and veggie options, plus two cakes on the day that a girl from the trip, Julia, and I shared a birthday! I just had to add this in because I couldn’t believe how soft my hair and skin were after swimming in the tea-colored acidic waters of the river. It lasted for days afterwards! I’m still rubbing my skin feeling a marked difference from the dryness the week before hiking the Inca Trail. Different parts of the river can be white or black, as seen in the photo above where two river offshoots meet, and it all depends on the rains as well. If you’ve been dreaming of seeing the Amazon, do it. I’ve been to jungles all over the world from Africa to Southeast Asia and Central America, but never anything as vast and remote as the Amazon in Peru. In every other case, I could just get into a car and drive in or out, sleeping in a hotel that night that was nowhere near as remote as the Tahuayo Lodge we stayed in. There’s nothing quite this wild or off the grid that I’ve done before, and I really valued each animal we saw because I knew that they were truly, 100% wild and that it was a gift to be seeing them. The experience is so unique, so if you want to do it, dooo it! If you want to repeat my Amazon Experience, book a flight into Iquitos on any of the local airlines including Peruvian, LATAM, and several others, and book with Tahuayo lodge. In addition to the Amazon, my tour group went to Rainbow Mountain, hiked the Inca trail, swam with sea lions near Lima, and sand boarded in Huacachina, plus a bunch of other awesome stuff. We’re likely repeating the trip in April 2019. Click here to read more about my tours and to pre-register for Peru! Okay, first, great post (as always!) and second, I love the sloth. But most importantly, there are mosquito onesies?! Brilliant. Yes and they are here to save the day! This is so fantastic, I’ve been obsessed with the Amazon since I was a kid too, when it was my turn in homeschooling to pick the topic to study and I picked rainforests, and I’ve always wondered the best way to go about actually visiting! Peru sounds like an amazing country with a  little bit of everything; like isn’t this the same country with giant mountains at super high altitudes to climb?? 😀 Right? Exactly! You can do it all in a couple of weeks. I don’t know the Amazon Trails game, but like you I have wanted to visit the Amazon since I was a kid. I think it was a book series written by Isabel Allende that kicked off my longing. This trip looked amazing! Yes it was so cool to finally see it! Please include more details on where to stay, where to book? I will be in Ecuador and Peru from October 29th until November 20th. Please post company names, phone numbers and particularly websites. Please and thank you! Hi, check the bottom section where I mention contacting Tahuayo lodge. You can google them. We organized it all through them. Hello Kristin, and thanks for this post, full of helpful info! Sure, Iquitos is a unique base to visit the Amazon. As for me, I much preferred Tarapoto, it’s not so much taken over by tourism, much more authentic (and considerably cheaper too!). Also, the jungle of Tarapoto is mountainous, when the one around Iquitos is flat. You had me at the Amazon Trail shoutout! Spearing those fish was so hard! 🙂 We were looking for more info on visiting the Amazon in Peru, and this is great. Thanks for the info! Photography in the jungle for animal and plant identification for the win! outside of the Tahuayo Lodge, would you recommend pre-booking amazon jungle treks or finding something in town? Hmm, what town? My only experience is with Tahuayo but I also know Peru to be the kind of place where you can find plenty of tours on offer if you wander around and ask, with the exception of really popular treks at popular times of year, like the Inca Trail. Loved reading your post! I’ve always wanted to go to the Amazon and your post really inspired me to go for it when I visit Peru in June. I’m wondering if you stayed for 3 nights 4 days or the 5 nights 6 days at Tahuayo?Thanks! 5 nights 🙂 Thank you!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/huacachina-peru/,"An Adventure Guide to Huacachina, Peru",Peru,"I first heard that Peru has 30 out of 32 world climates in Cusco right before I started hiking the Inca Trail. I hadn’t explored much yet, but it made sense considering there are several mountain ranges, the Amazon jungle, a nice long stretch of coastline, and the sand dunes of Huacachina all in Peru. Now that I’ve spent a month in Peru I can confirm, this country has more climates and microclimates than almost anywhere else I’ve been. That makes for some diverse travel options, as well as activities, and to be honest, a somewhat complicated packing list. All that aside, Huacachina was a highlight for me, mostly because deserts and dunes are beautiful and mashing down them on a sandboard or dune buggy had me smiling from ear to ear. The following are some of the best things to do plus a general guide to Huacachina: Huacachina is located about 5 hours south of Lima down a desolate stretch of coastline. Unless taking private transport, like we did on my BMTM Adventures tour, or if going with Peru Hop (which I honestly think is overpriced), you’ll need to catch a bus to Ica first. This is possible from both Lima and Cusco. Once in Ica, you’ll need to take a taxi to Huacachina. It’s a close drive and shouldn’t cost more than 10-12 soles. If you have a local SIM, you can also check for cars on Uber. The best time of day to enjoy the dunes is at sunrise and sunset. We arrived in Huacachina around 3pm and were on the dunes by golden hour. Sunrise is also a fantastic time to be out on the dunes. Take a headlamp along and head out to the dunes behind the oasis and watch the sunrise over Ica to illuminate the dunes. As you can see from the photo above, Huacachina is tiny. The town itself is not the draw, it’s the dunes! Just about everyone in town will try to sell you a dune buggy and sandboarding tour. They all go to the same place, so go with whatever price and company feels good to you. The buggy ride is one of the best parts, both because of the thrill of racing down the dunes, and the fact that it means you don’t have to climb the dune in order to sandboard down it. The buggies all run on a one-way track, so even if it seems like your driver is gunning forward full speed, you don’t need to worry about a buggy coming back at you in the other direction. Sandboarding, much like snowboarding, involves getting fitted for boots and strapping a board to your feet. It can be dangerous as the dunes are steep. I was a little surprised as well that we weren’t offered helmets like I had been in Namibia. That said, I find sand to be much softer than snow. If you enjoy snowboarding, then you’ll love sandboarding too. If that’s not your speed, you can also sled down on your stomach, face first. This reminded me a lot of air boarding in the snow. You can use your feet behind you as brakes if you’re going too fast for comfort. Scenic flights over the Nazca Lines, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, are also heavily promoted in Huacachina. Just about anywhere you can book activities will offer flights to the Nazca Lines as well. There are over 70 designs etched into the earth, ranging from simple geometric shapes to more complex animals and and human figures. They were created by the Nazca culture between 500 BC and 500 AD and the largest of them are up to 1200 feet long! Given the sheer size, they are best viewed from the air. From Huacachina, the going rate is around $90 USD and the excursion takes at least 6 hours, four of which are spent driving to and back from Nazca. Bring cash as at the time of this writing, the ATMs don’t always work in Huacachina and some or all of the fee for the flight must be paid in cash. As mentioned previously, Huacachina is tiny. There aren’t a ton of options, but my group and I enjoyed our stay at Hotel El Huacachinero. It’s located right in town and has a nice pool, which is welcome on those hot days out in the desert. For a more economical option, check out Wild Olive Guest House across the street. Both are well-positioned for an early morning dune climb!  Peru, I never would have guessed that I’d be climbing in mountains with snow falling down one day, riding a boat down a river the next, and shaking sand out of my shoes all in the same week. If you have a chance to make it to Huacachina, do it. It’s worth the time in the car or bus for this gorgeous desert experience. Looks like a ton of fun! They actually have this along the Oregon Coast with their huge dunes, but not at this scale and the weather is more cooperative in Peru and Namibia! Peru’s climate is nothing short of amazing. Peru was such a good choice and the video was fun to watch, everyone on the tour was just a great sport, making the most of the experience. I think Patagonia is a good one too for your future tour. BTW, once again, appreciate how you were thinking of helmets with the dunes. Even if in the end it is pretty safe, it is great to be safety conscious!Did you know that southernmost coastal Peru and northernmost Chile (Atacama Desert) are the driest places on Earth (some argue the poles are tied as the driest, but that’s changing)???  Arica, Chile is so dry that the average rainfall is less than 3mm a year (basically they just get fog and drizzle) with neighboring areas getting less than 1mm. They got some decent rainfall some years back during El Nino and it led to panic (and so many things are left uncovered since it is assumed it never rains!). Contrast that to the Amazon side of Peru that receives over 250 cm rain a year!  The only contrast I have experienced that is as drastic over really short distances is Kuaui, Hawaii. If you drive around Kuaui and go up the Mount Waialeale, you can go from the second wettest place on Earth with over 1000 cm of rainfall per year down to 50 cm year on the west side (can experience this within 2 hours of driving, well can only go half way up the mountain…saw arid land and tropical rainforest at the same time from our helicopter)!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hiking-the-inca-trail/,Hiking the Inca Trail in Peru: 15 Things You Need to Know,Peru,"Hiking the trail of the Incas is one of those YOLO experiences (can you forgive me for using that? It just felt so wrong it was right) that you’ve got to experience if you come all the way to Peru. Though there are other trails around Machu Picchu that are beautiful in their own way, the Inca Trail is the pilgrimage route that was built and traversed by the ancient Incas to reach their citadel. This moderately difficult hike is typically done over the course of four days and three nights, through gorgeous valleys and around sharp, sloping mountains. For the best possible experience, there are a few things you need to know about hiking the Inca Trail: Guides have been required on the Inca Trail since 2001. While you can hire a lone guide and carry your own pack, most hikers join an organized group with one of the licensed operators on the trail. It’s a more luxurious experience with delicious meals, large tents, comfy sleeping mats, and a much lighter pack thanks to the team of porters. While I’m normally the independent type when it comes to hiking, having porters to carry the load at that altitude was welcome, as were the descriptions from the guide about the Incan history and each of the ruins. Not all tour companies are created equally, though. Some offer a much more luxurious experience than others, with roomy tents, better food, and nicer gear overall. We went with a higher-end company and had top of the line sleeping mats, toilet tents, which is a luxury when your only other option is a squat toilet used by everyone else on the trail, only 2 people to each 4-person tent, warm water each evening and morning to wash our faces with, comfy pillows, incredible gourmet meals with fresh veggies every day, and even a cake baked right on the trail for a birthday girl in the group. I can safely say I’ve never eaten that well or enjoyed that much comfort on a multi-day trek. I highly recommend Alpaca Expeditions if it’s in your budget. The Inca Trail gets more popular every year, though thankfully they limit the amount of people who can do it, which keeps it pleasant. However this means that permits sell out almost immediately upon going on sale. Each permit is tied to an individual person’s name, and must match your passport exactly. For this reason, permits aren’t transferrable and must be booked quite far in advance. Keep that in mind if you want to hike the Inca Trail! The Sun Gate is one of the best views of Machu Picchu, one of the seven wonders of the world. Those who visit Machu Picchu by bus can still get to the wonder itself at sunrise, but not all the way to the Sun Gate, which is about an hour hike away. In full disclosure it was covered in clouds when I arrived for sunrise, but the creative commons photo above (since I couldn’t take one myself!) shows what it could look like if you got lucky with the weather. You want to know something neat? Peru has 30 out of 32 world climates and 90 different microclimates! It’s one of the most varied countries I’ve ever seen. The Inca Trail had cacti, mossy forests, glacier views, mist, rain, heat, and cold all in one hike, and sometimes all in one day. This made it delightful as we crossed through several different microclimates during the hike, but it also meant that we needed layers and waterproof clothing to make it comfortable. Prepare for cold temperatures and rain but bring sunscreen as well! Hiking the Inca Trail isn’t just about getting to Machu Picchu, though that is the crown jewel. Along the way you’ll see many other impressive ruins that were used for farming, lodging along the trail for the ancient Incas, and measuring moon cycles. Llactapata, ruins you’ll come across on day one, is pictured above. The Inca Trail is still 85% intact from the Incas, and they seemed to be huge fans of stairs! Most of the trail is paved with stone and for the majority of it, you’ll be climbing up and down stairs. Though it’s only a 20-mile trail, the gain upwards to the Dead Woman’s Pass is significant and it’s almost entirely stairs. It’s totally doable if you’re fit and in good health but could be a challenge otherwise. Since we’re on the topic of stairs, hiking boots are helpful for the ol’ ankles. This is the pair that I used, and have also put to the test in Alaska. They’re waterproof and offer excellent support. That said, if you don’t have a pair you’ve already broken in or really don’t want to travel with them, running shoes with tread are OK since it’s a dirt and stone path. Even if you think they’re nerdy, trust me, hiking poles are your friend. Depending on the company you book with, they may offer poles for rent. The Inca Trail isn’t particularly difficult to hike. It’s not technical and it’s not crazy steep. However, it is at altitude. At its highest point, Dead Woman’s pass, it reaches 4215 meters (≈13,800 feet!). If you’ve never hiked at altitude before, then let me forewarn you, it will be MUCH more pleasant if you acclimate in Cusco first for at least two days, maybe more. If you have hiked at altitude before, then you’ll remember that the air is much thinner and each step requires more effort. This is why it takes so long for most people to hike the trail even though on paper it seems short at around 20 miles. Huyana Picchu is the high mountain that you see behind Macchu Picchu and it gives you a unique and, IMHO, awesome perspective looking down on the ancient wonder. Most people who visit Macchu Picchu don’t make it to Huyana Picchu because it requires its own permit and it’s an additional 300 meters straight up, you guessed it, more stairs. If you can be coaxed, even though it might sound insane to sign up for more hiking after 4 days on the Inca Trail, I highly recommend this one as well. Just look at that view! Some hiking will be in the early morning hours, particularly on the final day of the hike into Macchu Picchu. You may also head into camp slightly after dark if you take frequent breaks on the trail or get a late start. It’s also helpful to have a headlamp around camp. The stars on the Inca Trail can be incredible. Don’t forget to look up at night! You’ll have porters who carry your food, tent, cooking equipment, and even 7 kilos of your personal items including your sleeping bag and camp clothes – at least that was the case on my tour. I only kept my sunscreen, bug spray, and camera equipment on my back, as well as the group ‘community poncho’ that you see in so many of these photos – you never know when a photo op will strike that could be made better by a colorful poncho! In all seriousness, keep your day pack light because you’ll feel every ounce at that altitude. If you can get the later train out of Aguas Calientes, where the hike ends, do try to stay all day at Machu Picchu, hike up Huyana Picchu, and visit the most popular parts of it in the afternoon after most of the visitors have left. Then make your way to the train (which strictly leaves on time by the way!), having enjoyed the ruins with fewer people.  I hope those tips help you to have a better experience hiking the Inca Trail. It’s an incredible hike and one of the most beautiful and unique trails I’ve experienced. It was also one of the most comfortable and delicious! Happy hiking. Hi Melanie, it’ll be around the same time – April. You can sign up here! http://eepurl.com/ds8c4L Hi! Is there a tour company you would recommend? I would love to join you in April 2019, but unfortunately that does not work with my schedule. Thanks so very much! Alpaca expeditions 🙂 Thank you! Thank you for all your tips! Does the permit need to be bought separately or is it included when you reserve your group tour? Yes it’s included in my tour 🙂  Great post! I did Inca Trail in 2013 and despite the commercialization of the trek, I actually really enjoyed it. I was lucky to hike with great people which probably was what made it so great. If you’re interested in hiking Inca Trails (or better: parts of the Inca Trail network), I recommend you visit the north of Peru. The Chachapoyas region is full of great hiking trails, old Inca Trail routes, giant waterfalls, ruins and more. Definitely recommend a visit. We live here, so I can speak from experience!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/rainbow-mountain-peru/,"Secrets of Rainbow Mountain, Peru: How to Do it Right",Peru,"Let’s talk about Rainbow Mountain, Peru. This Insta famous mountain with layered shades of red, yellow, and green recently exploded in popularity and I’m going to have to point the finger at Instagram. The social network is how I found out about it too, and I’m so glad that I did. All over Google, I read various headlines urging me not to go to rainbow Mountain, and others just showing overly saturated images of it. So what’s it really like? I took my group there on the first leg of my Peru BMTM Adventures tour (click here to learn how to join on future trips!) and everyone absolutely loved it. That said, it’s a challenging hike due to the altitude and not to be taken lightly. Here are the things to know about the hike and how to enjoy it to the fullest: You’ve probably seen pictures of Rainbow Mountain, part of the Ausangate mountain, also known as Vinicunca and Montaña de Siete Colores, with all kinds of color enhancement. Many of the images are, of course, digitally enhanced. That said, I was amazed by the colors in person, clearly seeing the layers of red, green, and yellow. It’s not just the mountain itself either, the entire surroundings are colorful. You can actually see colorful mountains like this all over the Andes, including in Patagonia, however this is one of the most brilliant, exposed, and accessible. Now for the rock nerds like me: The different coloration is due to mineralogy including chlorite for green,ferric sulphide for the yellow, and oxidized limonite for the red (probably). The photo above is not digitally enhanced, and you can expect to see colors like this when you visit yourself. Rainbow Mountain sits at 5200 meters in elevation, which is over 17,000 feet. To put this into perspective, it’s only slightly lower than Everest Base Camp and the Annapurna Circuit‘s Manang Pass in Nepal. As anyone who has hiked at altitude knows, you can hardly breathe in air that thin. Walking and talking at the same time are basically out of the question. Don’t even get me started on munching rainbow skittles while climbing to Rainbow Mountain. I have tried it, it was not successful. The day hike itself is not particularly difficult. For most of it, it’s a gentle upward slope. However the altitude makes it infinitely harder. Please don’t make this the first thing you do upon arriving in Cusco. Give yourself at least a few days to acclimate. It doesn’t have to do with physical ability or how your body reacted to altitude previously. Each experience in altitude is a new one and it can be dangerous if not respected. The hike in can vary from 9 days to one day. The vast majority of visitors visit for just one day, since the multi-day track is challenging and very high up. However the multi-day Rainbow Mountain hike takes you past snowcapped mountains, glaciers, and is on a quiet circuit with almost no other hikers. This is one I would love to do, so in case you would too, I’m just going to leave it here. To do the day hike from Cusco, you can book with a local tour operator that will pick you up between 3 and 4 AM in town. The drive to the start of the trail takes about three hours and begins around 4000 m. Entrance to the Rainbow Mountain costs 10 soles or it may be included in your transport fee. Unless it’s super high season and you’re concerned about availability, I’d wait to book a horse until you arrive rather than paying ahead of time online for 10x more. Read below for how to do it for cheaper. Upon starting the hike you will see plenty of local Quechua people with their horses. They are also selling coffee for 2 soles each and even allowed me to mix Milo and coffee – I was so excited I just had to share. The going rate, at least at the time of this writing, is 60 soles for a horse all the way from the beginning to the base of the mountain. At that point you will have to dismount and climb the rest yourself. When I went in April there were enough horses, though I imagine in the busier months of June and July you’ll need to make a decision right when you arrive about whether you want a horse or not. However when I was hiking, people were constantly offering the horses all along the way. They know that people want to attempt it on their own in the beginning and eventually relent and give up. Though it was a seductive offer, and they taunted me often with it, I declined and hiked the whole way up to the top by foot. However I had just finished the Inca Trail and I was already fully acclimatized. It was still very difficult for me and I took it slow. If you want a horse don’t be shy about it, just get one and enjoy your day. What I didn’t know before heading to rainbow Mountain is how breathtakingly beautiful not just the mountain, but the entire hike would be. There are llamas and alpacas all along the trail, you got a gorgeous view of the Ausangante Glacier, and it’s not just Rainbow Mountain that is colorful. All of the mountains are various shades of reds and greens. Yes, this hike is popular. In a lot of ways, it is quite touristy with people at the top dressed up with bedazzled llamas asking if you want to take pictures. But there are plenty of things in this world that are touristy for a good reason, and Rainbow Mountain is one of them. I thought it was incredible and I can’t wait to do it again, so I don’t mind that I had to share it with a few other people. You’re at a pretty high altitude, as I’ve mentioned excessively already, which means it can be very cold. I even had a little bit of snow at the top and hail as I came down. However they were the small hail balls which was exciting for me because it reminded me of Dippin’ Dots. Free Dippin’ Dots falling from the sky!? Heck yeah. Bring gloves, bring a waterproof jacket, and bring layers. Absolutely don’t forget to bring sunscreen, as you can get fried at altitudes like that. A lot of people don’t go all the way to the very top of the mountain. I understand it’s very difficult, but they’re missing the best part! If you have altitude sickness symptoms, descend as quickly as you can. It’s nothing to mess around with. But if not, try to go all the way to the top. You get a 360° view not just a rainbow Mountain, but of the nearby glacier and a gorgeous valley in the other direction. I think most people didn’t realize what they were missing by not going all the way up. So should you do Rainbow Mountain? Yes, it is touristy, but that doesn’t make it any less amazing. As long as you’re prepared for the altitude, dressed warmly, and willing to take a horse if you need to, it’s totally worth checking off the bucket list. After all, how many mountains in the world are dressed as a rainbow? Thanks for this great advice on all the options of experiencing and reaching Rainbow Mountain safely and properly. While Instagram and social media contributed to the huge surge in visitors the real culprit appears to be the changing climate? Would you agree?  This post reminded me of a National Geographic article (my memory fails, it could be another source, even an environmental journal) revealing this hidden secret a couple of years ago (2015-2016-ish) as a result of the retreating glacier and less snow-cover uncovering this. I hope to explore this one day and will not let ego impede my judgment of needing assistance (e.g., a horse). I am glad on the positive side, that the touring is helping the local economy that was so depressed.I feel this might be an opportunity for tourists to see such a huge impact of climate change (or just the impact we have on our world!) and there are models of touring that protect the environment out there. I know some people who are doing a “glacier farewell tour” where they are going all over the world to see the retreating glaciers before they are all gone or severely reduced (not all are disappearing so soon, but ones like in Peru, Mt. Kilimanjaro, Alaska).  I tell people that retreating glaciers in themselves could be part of the ebb and flow of such things in Earth’s history; it is the speed of the retreat which is breathtaking, unique, and worrisome. There are some that are temporarily growing like in New Zealand, to be fair and balanced, but these are unusual (some from added snow as temperature rises toward freezing since can hold more moisture, more snow). Glaciers can sometimes provide a clear-cut story though of how the recent warming is having a physical, visible impact.I think if people can simply show some respect for where they are traveling that it is great for people to want to appreciate the world they live in and explore all the beauty as possible! This is our home and we should enjoy it while keeping it in order. I will get off my soap box now (I could certainly do more myself than I have)!   BTW your tours look so awesome! Agreed it’s only the retreating glacier that has exposed this rock. I hate to say, everyone speaks of how there used to be abundance when they were younger, all over the world, with fish, animals, etc. The overwhelming info I’m getting is weather is changing and there is less and less out there. So many people from different corners of the globe all agreeing on one thing, now that’s interesting. awesome blog! thanks for sharing… Thanks for this great advice on all the options of experiencing and reaching Rainbow Mountain safely and properly. This is a fabulous article about Rainbow Mountain and value information for all of u. Thanks! I am Peruvian and I can’t wait to do this hike. hi, can you give any advice about the 8-day-hike? can you do it on your own or has it to be a guided tour? you wsnns come with in 3weeks?🤗 thanks, andy I haven’t done it so I don’t know, but I understand it can be pretty tough so you might be happy to have mules carrying your gear, if they offer that. Is it better to take a tour that will bring you  there? Or it’s not hard to hike there by yourself? If to take a tour which one is better depending on a better price?:)Thank you I’d just take a tour probably. It’s the easiest way to get there and I’d just go with the cheapest. They all bring you to the same place. Hi Kristine, Thank you very much for all your information that very  important for us to know before climbing this mountain.I really appreciate your time and great information that you share with us. I am 59 years old woman and consider pretty active do gym/ hike total 4 times a week.My dream is to clim this mountain with my 20 years old daughter.She doesn’t do lots of sport due to her school schedules but walks almost everyday to campus in Berkeley from her apartment.We are planning to climbs on the last day -5th day in Cuzco. Is May good time to go not too cold?Please give your suggestion whether or not I should do it due to my age.I understand there is tour guide that provide oxygen tank. I will definitively ride a horse..,by the way if I decide to climb it. Do you have Instagram?  Looking forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you,Srie CoustarWest Los Angeles Ita really not age that matters with hiking at altitude, it’s acclimatizing which it sounds like you’re doing. I’ve been on trails with people in their 70s passing me up! It’s just an individual thing. Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and drink lots of water and that’ll all help. So how long in total did it take you from bottom to top and back?  And if you are super fast, what’s the average persons time do you think?Cheers A few hours since we wanted to spend a good chunk of time at the top. It’s very hard to be super fast at that altitude but maybe if you take a horse a couple of hours would work. However keep in mind it takes hours to get there and back from Cusco, it’s really a full day trip. For anyone planning this trek, I would really recommend at least an overnight trek to the Rainbow Mountain. Taking an extra day allows you to break up the driving, leave later, and have the mountain all to yourself, before trekkers making a day trip arrive. The stars are also incredible That does sound like a good idea! Thank you all for sharing your tips, and advice  it looks and sounds amazing . We are visiting for 3 weeks later this year and can’t wait. Reaching rainbow mountain summit will be incredible    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cusco-peru/,"The Best Things to Do in and Around Cusco, Peru",Peru,"Do you ever get that feeling when you arrive in a place and without knowing it yet or having any tangible reason, you just like it? That’s how Cusco, Peru, felt with its orange buildings, brisk air, and mountainous surroundings. Cusco, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the perfect jumping off point for some incredible hikes, adventurous activities, and of course, Machu Picchu. Though this Wonder of the World is what draws most people to Cusco, there’s so much more do in and around the city. Cusco was the capital of the Incan empire in the 13th century, serving as the literal center of power, with four roads leading from Cusco to the four quarters of the empire. Today, Cusco displays a mix of Incan and Spanish architecture and history, as well as serving as the perfect starting point for several day trips and multi-day treks. Choose your own adventure below: Cusco is considered the historical capital of Peru, thanks in large part to Incan sites of major significance like Sacsayhuamán. Like Machu Picchu, Sacsayhuamán was a citadel of major significance to the Incas. The most mind-blowing aspect of seeing it up close is the sheer size of the stones, most weighing several tonnes, and marveling at how they fit together perfectly without mortar. How did they carve these stones so perfectly? How much man power did it take to move just one? We can only speculate. This is a great introduction to Incan culture and to Cusco. It’s easy to get to, perched right above the city. Take a taxi up to the top, or walk, and walk back down the stairways and alleyways back into Cusco. It’s the perfect afternoon-to-evening activity while you acclimate to the altitude. Watch the full video with all of the things to do here:  The Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Peru is a central point where you’ll find plenty of restaurants, touts selling massages for 20 soles, ATMs, street vendors selling photos with bedazzled alpacas, and in the evenings, dance troupes. I loved walking through it at night just after the sun went down and all the buildings on the hillsides lit up. It looked like a frame of little stars all around the cathedral and colonial arcades. On your day trip out from Cusco to Moray or the Sacred Valley, you’ll pass a mirador (viewpoint) overlooking the Sacred Valley that’s perfect for paragliders. The views are nothing short of incredible. Though I only stopped at the mirador to take a photo, as many vans bound for the Moray or Salinas de Maras will, it would have been pretty cool to paraglide! You can book it here. If you want even more adrenaline, you can bungee jump nearby as well. The circular Moray is another fascinating Incan ruin and a nice contrast to Sacsayhuamán. Instead of serving as a citadel, Moray was an agricultural ‘laboratory’ with several terraces of varying temperatures, presumably for more effective farming. You can take a guided day tour of the Moray and the salt mines of Maras mentioned below for $24, picking up and dropping off in Cusco. You’ll see them advertised on just about every shop window in town, or you can book with a trusted company here.  Just a 20-minute ride away from Moray, the salt mines of Maras are quite a sight. I recall while planning out my Peru trip itinerary months ago, and declaring them a must-do for my BMTM Adventures tour after seeing a photo on Instagram. They were just too perfect for words. They did not disappoint in person. There are thousands of pools of salt all along a hillside that opens up into the Sacred Valley, again left behind by the Incas, and still very much in use today. Workers manually scrape out the salt on the pond surfaces and are hard at work as the tours of the mines take place. It’s amazing to see an Incan creation that’s still in use for its original purpose. For a more adventurous experience in Cusco, you can experience the Sacred Valley by seeing it from above, carried by your hands and feet. I’m not going to sugarcoat it, the via ferrata, which is a clipped-in rock climb on cables and wire rungs on the rock face, can be intense. It’s vertical, takes upper body strength, and in parts, a bit of courage too. That said, our whole group of 15 made it up, and though it was the first time most of them had done anything like it, the overwhelming response was that it was an amazing sense of accomplishment. The best part is you get to zipline all the way back down after. You can also book the sky lodges at the top for lunch, or even an overnight. It’s pricey, and I’d hate to have to wake up in the middle of the night to need to clip in and climb to use the bathroom, but it would absolutely be a unique experience! Book it here. The Rainbow Mountain, Vinicunca, or Montaña de Siete Colores, has recently exploded in popularity after becoming insta-famous a few years ago. Mineral deposits on the famous mountain itself, and most of the surroundings, have made it an incredible explosion of colors in all directions. I wondered if it would look as cool in person as it does in photos, and it does! For the benefit of anyone reading this, I did not enhance the colors here. It really looked like that. It’s worth a day trip, however I urge you to do this towards the end of your Cusco experience once you’re already acclimated. The hike starts out over 4000 meters and ends at 5200 meters (over 17,000 feet) above sea level. I couldn’t do any more than slowly walk up, even though it was only a gradual incline for most of it. I felt the altitude the entire way, and this was after hiking the Inca trail in the preceding days. It’s a 3-hour drive each way from Cusco, and most people join a tour to get there which you can book for cheap in town. It’s also possible to hire a horse for 60 soles to bring you most of the way up, which half of my group did and I would recommend if you’re worried about the altitude. But do try to get all the way to the top, it’s an amazing view! Here are a few more essentials to know. This gorgeous lake is what you’ll see on day one of the Salkantay trek, should you decide to do it, or it can be done as a day trip from Cusco. The drive from town takes about 3 hours, and most trips pickup around 3am. The climb is steep in parts, but the end reward of Humantay peak is a worthy reward. The hike is 7km (4 miles) in length, but most of it takes place over 4200 meters. Acclimate for this one, too! You can book it here. I left the best for last here, because we all know that everyone heading to Cusco, Peru has one thing on their minds: Machu Picchu. It’s incredible in person, and very much worth the effort to get there. I highly recommend hiking the Inca Trail in, as there are many other gorgeous ruins along the way. It’s also an amazing feeling to hike in the way that the Incas did, on a trail that was built by them and is still 85% intact in its original form. However if that’s not your thing, you can also take a day trip from Cusco, or spend the night in Aguas Calientes, the town at the base, and take a bus up for sunrise. Alternatively, check out the Lares or Salkantay treks if you can’t get permits for the Inca Trail. Those are the best things to do in Cusco, Peru. I hope this guide helped you to narrow down some of the coolest activities, and gives you a wide range of adventures to choose from. Cusco was my introduction to Peru and I can’t say enough good things about it. It was so fantastic, I’m already planning my next group trip there.

Any purchase you make helps to support this site at no extra cost to you. Happy travels! Great share! Excellent article! Cusco has a lot of incredible destinations to explore! I loved the plaza de armas of this city because of its architecture and cultural feeling! Only having lunch or drinking something in a balcony there was an amazing experience! I would like to return soon to visit the rainbow mountain.  Hey there! I’ll be going to Cusco soon with a friend and, as it’s her birthday shortly before, I was wondering whether you have any tip for a gift in form of an activity around Cusco? Pick one from this list! I know this may be a silly question, but I’mHiking Macchu Picchu in May with my daughter.  The tour company recommends trekking pants on their gear list and they are not my favorite thing to wear.  Is it doable to just wear my leggings that I run in or do you recommend getting the trekking pants? I always just wear leggings! Mine dry quickly and I’m like you – if I bring trekking pants I just won’t wear them. Hi Kristin! Amazing advices and inspiring trip!Did you feel altitude sickness only during the trip to Rainbow mountains or also during the days in Cuzco?I’m planning a trip to Perù and I would like to avoid altitude problems, which are your advices?Thanks I did feel the altitude at Rainbow Mountain, just in terms of the thin air and it being more difficult to hike for me than it normally would be. The best thing you can do is acclimate. You need time in Cusco before you attempt rainbow mountain, and you’ve got to level up gradually.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tahiti-best-things-to-do/,Tahiti’s Best Things to Do,French Polynesia," “Kristin! You come eat,” beckoned Karl, intent on having me join the Sunday feast his family spent all day preparing.  A little shy, I willed myself to eat whatever was placed before me and walked downstairs. Though I’d steeled myself, in the end I was wowed. he table was full of purple taro, and what would become my favorite French Polynesian dish – poisson cru de coco – raw cured tuna cubes in lemony coconut juice. Thus began two weeks of being welcomed everywhere I went in French Polynesia as though I was already a friend. Even better, it was the impetus of two weeks of never having anything less than a stellar, fresh-as-they-come meal line-pulled right out of the glittering blue Pacific.  I laughed a bit to myself. Even after all these years of solo travel, I had some trepidation about coming to a place I knew nothing about. It was all unfounded. French Polynesia quickly shot up to my top five favorite countries of all time. But not because of Tahiti.   Tahiti is the first stop when you come to French Polynesia. Many tourists stay there, or head to Bora Bora for overwater bungalows. I think they’re missing out. It’s not that Tahiti, with its lush jungles and abundant waterfalls, did anything in particular wrong, it’s just that FP has so much more, so much better on offer.  To me, Tahiti is a pass-through. But it is worth spending a few days, or maybe just one, to see the jungly interior. If you do, these are some of the best things to do in Tahiti:  Whether you’re coming in by plane or cruise ship, you’re going to pass through the capital, Papeete. At the market you can find local fruits, veggies, vanilla, and can see people playing music. Eating there is cheaper than in other parts of the city, and it can be a good place to buy souvenirs. You’re also pretty close to the pearl markets. It’s open every day: Mon: 5 AM – 6 PM, Tues-Sat: 4 AM – 6 PM, Sun: 3 AM – 9 AM. From there, you’ll make your way south past Fa’a’ā and down to the next stop. This one’s a quick stop off of the main road, about half a kilometer down a dirt road, to some old Polynesian ruins. Most of the statues are replicas, but much of the grounds is authentic. The best way to get a good sense of it is to go with a guide because there are not many signs, but if you’re just popping by on your way around the island, it will give you a bit of history. I have no doubt this place used to be cool. It looked absolutely beautiful in photos, which is what motivated me to visit. It’s pretty easy to access, is well-marked, and is just off the road. It’s also free to visit, which is a plus. However it’s totally blocked off! I believe, due to falling rock, you can no longer walk up to the grottos and instead have to view them from behind a fence. That kind of ruins it for me, although there was a guy there who kept offering to let me take pictures of him and his tattoos, which I politely declined. From there the next major stop is the Water Gardens, which are also free. You can walk through the palm forest, check out the lotuses, and there are even some waterfalls along the trails, which range from 1-2.5 km long. Bring bug spray! That advice goes for all of Tahiti.  Teahupo’o is one of the world’s most famous surf breaks – the one you’ve seen on dorm walls (or was that just me going to school in California?), and in surf videos. It’s known as the most dangerous break in the world due to the unique combination of size, power, and speed, not to mention it breaks on a coral reef. If you’re there at the end of August, you can catch the Tahiti Pro Teahupo’o surf competition. In case you’re not ready to shred that way, you can see from the shore with binoculars, or take a water taxi over from the town by the same name. We just flew the drone over to get a closer look, which felt like cheating but also like winning. From there you’ll need to backtrack a bit back to where the island narrows and feeds back into the larger circle. Heading north you’ll pass by a couple of roadside waterfalls. They are not that amazing, I would suggest you keep going or make it a very quick stop. You can’t miss them.  When you pull off for this waterfall, you’ll notice that there are three others in the same area, all of which are big and beautiful. At the time of this writing, only one is open due to rockfall at the other two trails.  Like most of this list, they are free to visit and not much of a deviation from the route, so it’s worth pulling off to see if they’re open when you visit. They look best after rainfall. This is where Tahiti really shines. The uninhabited interior of Tahiti is full of waterfalls, the famous Lac Vaihiria, impossibly green jungle, and jade-colored water. Most people book a 4 x 4 tour to see this part of Tahiti, as it’s not possible to get very far unless you have a 4 x 4 vehicle. While you can book those at the airport, they are all stick shift. With our one day layover, my friend and I rented a cheap car that we could both drive as non-stick shift drivers, and we really felt like the beauty of Tahiti was in the center, not the roadside attractions. Next time, I plan to spend all of my time in this valley. The best way to make sure that you see everything is probably to book a 4×4 tour (here’s a list of the best-rated ones on Tahiti). However if you can drive a stick, and are feeling adventurous, to me it would be tons of fun to do this independently. This is supposed to be one of the most famous and beautiful waterfalls in Tahiti, inclusive of a somewhat long but nice hike to get there. Nowadays, you’re required to obtain a permit before hiking to this waterfall. You can get it at city hall in Papeete, but there’s a catch, as it’s only open on weekdays until 5 PM. So if you’re only there over a weekend, unfortunately you won’t be able to go to this waterfall, as word on the street is there is a gate preventing you from continuing. This is what kept me from visiting Fautaua. This is the third highest peak on Tahiti at 2066 meters tall and though it’s a tough, slippery hike, the reward is stunning. There are sharp drop offs and breathtaking views all along the way.  The trail begins at Le Belvedere restaurant, a fantastic spot for views, and continues upward for 5.5 miles. Since low-hanging clouds often compromise visibility, more time, two days, is often necessary to complete the hike. There are apparently huts along the way, but this is one might be best organized with a local guide, unless you’re feeling particularly adventurous. French Polynesia experiences several migrations throughout the year. In the months of August through October, humpback whales migrate through and Tahiti and neighboring Mo’orea – two of the best spots to swim with them. You can read more here. There are also many stingrays and sharks in the area. Both are friendly and amazing to swim with. You can also see turtles and all kinds of colorful fish on both diving and snorkeling tours, almost all of which take place in nearby Mo’orea. Tahiti’s neighbor is stunning and also easy to access via ferry from Papeete. This is where more of the snorkeling and diving excursions take place. While it can be done as a day excursion, do yourself a favor and spend some time on Mo’orea as well. Let’s be honest, Tahiti is not known for its beaches. However as you drive on the southeastern part of the island there will be several places where you can pull off and explore some black sand beaches. There’s also a public beach at Mehana Park, which you will pass before the grotto coming down from Papeete. While Bora Bora made overwater bungalows famous, Tahiti has plenty that you can stay in as well. The following resorts have overwater bungalows with gorgeous views: InterContinental Tahiti Resort and Spa Tahiti Pearl Beach Resort If you want a more local, cheaper, pension experience referenced in the opening of this article, you can meet Karl and stay at Fare Nukumai.  At the end of my time in Tahiti, all I can say is I’m glad we had a drone during our day long island road trip. I learned a lot though, mostly that having a 4 x 4 is the best way to see the really cool stuff on Tahiti, and to avoid the buses full of octogenarians – nothing against them but I just prefer less crowded sightseeing – on your adventure. Whether that means taking a tour or self driving, I think the real adventure lies in the center. All that said, there are so many islands in French Polynesia, you’re doing yourself a disservice if you don’t explore them. If you’re like me, the farthest and more most rural ones are going to be your favorites. I can’t wait to go back and explore more of French Polynesia, the friendliness and natural beauty are hard to beat.     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/fakarava-french-polynesia-guide/,"Fakarava: What to Do, See, and Eat!",French Polynesia,"Imagine long stretches of snow-hued sand framed by turquoise blue water on one side, and the deep sapphire of the Pacific on the other. When standing in the middle, one can easily see both sides in this long, slim island. Palm trees lean lazily over the blue while black-tipped reef sharks weave through the water, given away by their conspicuous dorsal fins in the ankle-deep water.  There’s hardly anyone else on the beach, yet it’s one of the most pristine in the world. I feel like I’ve stumbled upon a secret paradise – one of many in French Polynesia.  Locals throw out the shaka and say “Ia Ora na” (pronounced yo-rah-nah) as I cycle by on my beach cruiser. As I’ve come to understand and love about French Polynesia, friendliness is built into the cultural fabric.  I make a quiet promise to myself to improve my high school French. I love it that much here, along with the sea breeze, walls of sharks, afternoon rains and mosquito bites. I understand why the 800 or so residents live here. It’s instant relaxation.  During my time there I explored, dived, biked, and ate to my heart’s content. This is everything you need to know about visiting Fakarava in French Polynesia:  Fakarava is located in the Tuamotu Archipelago, close to the largest atoll in French Polynesia, Rangiroa. As of this writing, Air Tahiti flies to Fakarava from Tahiti every day of the week, except once in a while they skip Tuesdays (the most) and/or Thursdays. You can also reach Fakarava from Rangiroa on Tuesdays (sometimes), Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  As is the case with most Air Tahiti flights, budget around $250 each way if flying from Tahiti. It’s also possible to fly onward to the Marquesas from Fakarava, which I find quite exciting. You can book your flights here.  Most pensions offer transport to and from as part of their rates, since there are no taxis or buses in Fakarava. You’ll see when you land – it’s a small, one-room airport! If you’ve heard of Fakarava, chances are good you already know it’s famous for SCUBA diving, which I’ll cover in the next section, but there’s a lot more to it than that! Here are a few more of my favorites: Plage du PK9: This is the best beach I’ve ever been to, and I’ve been to a lot! The sand is white, I didn’t see one piece of trash, and there’s hardly anyone else there. You’ll find PK9 on the north side of the island, past the airport to the west.  I biked the 9km there and back from my guesthouse in Rotoava town (“PK9” essentially means 9km from Rotoava!). After the airport, the road turns into dirt, but it’s flat and easy enough to bike if you can avoid the big rocks and potholes. Your reward is paradise. Bring your snorkel mask! A word of caution – PK9 is 1km before the end of the north side of the island. The current is very strong at the pass, so swimming is not advised. Save it for SCUBA diving!  Pink Sand Beach (Les Sables Roses): While there are several pink sand beaches in Fakarava, this little sandbar is the most famous and perhaps the most striking. It’s best accessed from the south part of the island. You can organize a trip through your guesthouse.  Lagoon Tours: Not a diver? Not a problem. Lagoon tours can take you to some of the best snorkeling spots in the area. Some pensions include this in their rate, others charge extra for it. As with most excursions in Fakarava, you can organize this through your pension (guesthouse). Some pensions include this in their rate, others charge extra for it. Ride a Bike: I loved this part of Fakarava! You can just hop on a bike and see where the adventure takes you. Locals will say hello as you pass by, you’ll see gorgeous beaches and signs for pearls, and every now and then, a snack bar. Pull over whenever you feel compelled. It’s flat and easy, and impossible to get lost. I loved it!  Stargaze: It’s so safe in Fakarava, it’s easy to just hop on a bike and explore at night, but bring a light with you so that cars can see you. The street lights end once you’re out of town. On a clear night, you can clearly see the Milky Way. Even though I had clouds, it was a beautiful sight. I can honestly say this was some of the best SCUBA diving I have ever done. If you love the big stuff, you’re going to love diving in Fakarava. Most dive shops organize single dives or if it’s a far trek, like a day trip to the Tumakohua (south) Pass from Rotoava, it’ll be a day trip to the tune of about $200, including lunch. It’s more expensive than most diving I’ve done, but it was worth it every time.  Tumakohua (South) Pass: The walls of sharks at this southern pass are what makes it famous. Plan on black and white-tipped reef sharks, upwards of one to two hundred at once. The best way to dive the Tumakohua Pass is to stay down south. I learned this the hard way when some bad weather came in and made it impossible for me to dive it. It was disappointing, but only reinforced what I already knew, I would be coming back to Fakarava. Based on what I heard from others who dived it, the amount of sharks was unbelievable.  Garuae (North) Pass: I dived this one twice. Keep in mind this is a drift dive and the current is very strong. The more experience you have, the better. Expect to see plenty of sharks here, too.  In addition, you’ll see a wide variety of schools of fish. The abundance was mind blowing. I also regularly saw manta rays, having the most prolonged and close encounter I’ve ever had with one. On our slowest day we even saw a freaking humpback whale during the dive. I think that says it all. If you do decide to stay on the north side of the island and want to dive both passes, give yourself more time than I did. Excursions can get canceled if there are not enough people or especially if the weather is not good, which is what happened in my situation. Two out of four days that I had in Fakarava were pretty windy and rainy. This is uncommon in September but it happened to me, so give it more time if you can. Dive Operators: Additionally, if you stay near the Tumakohua Pass, many of the accommodation providers down there also provide dive packages. More on that in the next section.  Fakarava is not like Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Rangiroa when it comes to accommodation. To me, that makes it perfect, because I love little pensions and prefer my islands more raw and rustic. I like the type of tourist it attracts and the laid back vibe it promotes. Keep this in mind when considering Fakarava. Nothing’s too fancy.  With that in mind, the first question you want to ask yourself is, North or South Fakarava?  Fakarava is split into two main areas. The largest town, which is really just a cluster of a few buildings and a shop, is Rotoava. It’s well-situated for PK9 and the Garuae pass. The southern part of the island is about 1.5 hours away by boat. If you have the time, split your days between the two! Pensions on Fakarava:  Check out TripAdvisor for more options.  French Polynesian cuisine is seafood-based, and if you’re already familiar with it, you’ll know that sashimi, poisson cru (cured, raw fish usually in coconut milk or sweet and sour vinegar), and grilled tuna are usually on offer. Since Fakarava is a coral atoll that can only produce fish and coconuts, don’t plan on a lot of fresh veggies.  That said, there’s a store near Relais Marama with a pretty good selection of frozen veggies and pasta, so we split our time between Snack Elda, the best for fresh seafood, and cooking in the communal kitchen. Many pensions on this list will also provide meals as part of their room rate. I tend to prefer that when in French Polynesia anyways, mostly because I’m very lazy when it comes to figuring out food.  You’ll find a pizza shop, boulangerie (bakery), and a few other ‘snack’ places as well (snack means small eatery). The locals on the island agreed, Snack Elda is where it’s at.  If you’re lucky enough to visit Fakarava, I hope you’ll love it as much as I did. The friendliness, pristine waters, incredible diving, and laid back nature made me love it so. I know I’ll be back next year. I have more sharks to see!     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-best-time-to-visit-tahiti/,The Best Time to Visit Tahiti,French Polynesia,"Tahiti in the South Pacific is an island with a reputation for incredible waterfalls, beautiful beaches, delicious seafood, and those famous overwater bungalows. It’s a short distance away from Moorea, famous for stingrays and shark sightings, and of course, Bora Bora, the honeymoon spot of dreams.  Tahiti doesn’t have typical seasons that most of us are used to. With temperatures consistently reaching around the mid-80’s as highs and dropping to around 70 as lows all year long, “seasons” in Tahiti must be created categorically based on humidity and rainfall. Here’s everything you need to know about Tahiti’s weather, crowds, and prices so that you can plan the best trip:  Weather & Precipitation: November transitions into the heart of wet season in December and January. Average rainfall increases from 6.4 inches in November to a yearly monthly maximum of 12.4-12.5 inches in December and January, making up the rainiest part of the year. Because of all this rainfall, these months are significantly more humid than the rest of the year, with December being the most humid time of year. Pricing: Because of the wet weather, these months are the least crowded with tourists. If you’re willing to tolerate the rain and humidity, the prices this time of year will be worth it, as flights can be as low as half of the peak season prices. Many hotels, too, are significantly cheaper per night during the rainy season. Booking Ease: Booking a trip for these months is significantly easier than for other times of year. Accommodations are rarely sold out, even at the last minute, whereas accommodations for peak season can sell out even a year ahead of time.  While writing this post, I did a mock booking search to compare prices, and I found that it is both cheaper and easier to book a January trip to Tahiti — even though that’s only three months from now — than it is to book a July or even October trip there, nine to twelve months from now. A nice hotel in Tahiti in January would’ve cost me about $150 per night, but for next October, the same hotel was completely sold out.  Major Attractions & Availability: Because the temperatures are still warm, no activities or attractions will be impossible. You certainly won’t be holed up inside under blankets and sweaters! However, the frequent rain might make it more difficult to partake in certain activities like surfing or hiking. Just be sure to, first, keep an eye on the forecast and, second, plan an itinerary which is flexible so that it can be rearranged at the last minute due to weather changes.  Weather & Precipitation: While still part of the rainy season, these months receive, on average, about thirty to fifty percent less precipitation than December-January (peak of rainy season), with monthly averages dropping from 9.2 inches of rain in February to just 5.5 inches by April. Little by little, the humidity also decreases this time of year. Still plan for rain, but know that it won’t be at its worst.  Pricing: Prices will start to climb as you get nearer to peak season, but even in April, flights are still several hundred dollars cheaper than they will be at the heart of the dry season. Hotels and accommodations, too, will increase in cost, but only by about twenty-five percent between January and April.  Booking Ease: Booking flights and accommodations is fairly easy in these months, as nothing will be sold out quite yet. Still work in extra time, though, as you get closer and closer to the start of May.  Major Attractions & Availability: Drier weather means outdoor activities like hiking and water activities are more feasible and more enjoyable. Rain is always a possibility, though, so be prepared to adjust your itinerary accordingly if showers suddenly appear, as they likely will. A cool event on the islands to start off this time of year is the Pacific International Documentary Film Festival, also known as FIFO (a French acronym which stands for Festival International du Film documentaire Océanien), which takes place in early February. Weather & Precipitation: May marks the start of Tahiti’s dry season, with the month of May dropping to just over 3.5 inches of rain per month, with June and July seeing an average of only about 2.4 inches. The humidity continues to decrease, making way for more and more clear, dry days. Pricing: Gorgeous weather means that prices rise. By the middle of July, costs will be at their highest. Even if you book far in advance, rates for hotel rooms, flights, and more will automatically be higher than at other times of year.  If you must visit the islands at this time of year, just keep an eye out for flash sales and try to book your trip for when prices are at their lowest, whether that be in the middle of the week, the end of the month, or closer to the shoulder months.  Booking Ease: Not only does peak season guarantee big prices, it also guarantees big crowds. Tahiti sees some of its highest numbers of tourists on the islands during these months, especially because it is official summer vacation time for much of the world. Accommodations will fill up rapidly as the season approaches, so book well in advance. You really can’t be too safe in terms of planning ahead.  Major Attractions & Availability: Because May, June, and July have such wonderful weather, any and all activities should be fair game! Again, though, keep the crowds in mind, and if you’re planning on booking any kind of guided tours or excursions around the islands, do your research and plan ahead. Also note that the Heiva, a month-long Polynesian cultural and traditional event on the islands, takes place each July in Tahiti. The festival is made up of music, dance shows, sports competitions, and other festivities, which would be wonderful to experience but could also lead to more crowds. Additionally, hundreds of marine animals, like sharks and rays, come to the islands to feed in July!  Weather & Precipitation: The months of August and September receive even less rain than the two months preceding them, averaging at just around 1.8-1.9 inches of rainfall per month. October is still relatively dry rising up to only 3.5 inches. This makes up the tail end of the islands’ dry season. Obviously, as the year cycles through on its way back to the rainy season, the rain begins increasing as the weeks go by late in this period, but even at the end of October, neither rain nor humidity should be too much of an issue. Pricing: Pricing will still be very high during these months, as they are technically part of Tahiti’s peak season. The longer in the season you wait to visit, the lower prices will likely be. Perhaps mid-September and later, after much of the world has gone back to school and work, will bring manageable prices, but the only way to know for sure is to keep tabs on flights and hotels so that you’ll know when the rates drop. Booking Ease: It goes without saying that the more into September and October you go, the easier booking will be, yet it still holds true that booking is not easy, even towards the end of the dry season. While it largely depends on what and where you’re booking, October can still be completely blacked out for dates at certain hotels, and flight prices might not be dropping as quickly as you’d like them to. Watch airlines and accommodations to be the first to know if prices drop or availability opens up.  Major Attractions & Availability:  Since these months are still encompassed in the dry season, the islands’ attractions remain readily available thanks to the nice weather. Take advantage of the clear skies while you can and soak up all of the gorgeous island sunshine! Also keep in mind that the International Graffiti Art Festival ONO’U takes place in Tahiti this time of year, which might be worth checking out! Meanwhile, the large population of humpback whales stays near the islands during this whole three month period, all the way through the end of October, so this season brings tons of opportunities to experience them! Regardless of when you choose to visit Tahiti, know that the delicious food, culture, and beauty of the islands is there year-round. More powerful waterfalls and smaller crowds could mean low season is the best time for you, while if you prefer milder weather and don’t mind crowds, June – September could be the best time. The good news is, you can’t really go wrong!  *NOTE: All rainfall data from the United States National Climatic Data Center, compiled by U.S. News Travel. No related posts.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-philippines-alternatives/,"El Nido, Philippines is Overtouristed, Here are 8 Amazing Alternatives",Philippines,"In April of 2018, the island of Boracay in the Philippines was closed down by the government due to the ravaging effects of overtourism. The tourism industry was so detrimental to the island, in fact, that the president of the Philippines referred to it as a “cesspool.” Boracay simply could not support the weight of the insane numbers of tourists and would require six months of complete rehabilitation.  The tourism boom in the Philippines didn’t just affect Boracay, though. Recently, El Nido has begun to undergo the same cycle. Partly because of tourism shifting from Boracay to the next best thing, and partly because of the same tourism growth that Boracay was subject to in the first place, tourism in El Nido has nearly tripled over the last five years. This has resulted in some serious environmental repercussions. Now, El Nido might be facing the same fate as Boracay: governmental closure. Even if such an extreme move can be avoided, some parts are still closed off to swimmers, according to CNN.  Luckily, the Philippines are made up of more than 7,000 islands, countless pristine beaches, and friendly people practically everywhere you go. El Nido needs some space to breathe, so here are 8 amazing alternative destinations to visit in the Philippines:  One can happily spend anywhere from a few days to a month on Siargao Island, the surf capital of the Philippines. Most visitors to the island hang out in General Luna, but smaller and quieter Pacifico is a great option, too. Start by seeing the bright teal Sugba Lagoon, or take an island-hopping trip to Naked, Daku, and Guyam Island. Cruise around on a rented motorbike, check out the Magpupungko Rock Pools, and visit Sohoton Cove.  Be sure to take a surf lesson before you leave, and rest assured that many of the surf areas don’t see huge crowds, so you won’t have to keep up with all the best surfers on the island. Volunteer with the Siargao Environmental Awareness (SEA) Movement if you want to spend a small chunk of your time on the island helping keep it pristine!  Aquamarine water, friendly locals, and few tourists: these are three good reasons to visit Romblon Island.  Romblon is known for its sandbars and numerous small satellite islands, but it’s perhaps most famous for a bright white sandbar called Bon Bon Beach. Its neighbor, gorgeous Tiamban Beach, offers calm waters and an uncrowded stretch of white sand. Snorkel either on Logbon Island or on Cobrador Island, the latter of which is home to a sea turtle sanctuary. Then, jump into the ocean off the diving board at Marakay Marakay off Cobrador.  See the cool caves and rock structures of Tinagong Dagat, or get off the beaten path and explore Libtong Falls & Inuquit Falls. Stay on one of the smaller islands off Romblon Island, like Alad Island, for a peaceful getaway!  Referred to by locals as “Isla del Fuego,” (island of fire) because of the mystical fireflies that light up the sky when the stars come out, Siquijor Island is a great alternative to El Nido.  The island has everything you could want in the Philippines: waterfalls, corals, caves, and white sand beaches. San Juan is a hub of activity thanks to abundant restaurants and resorts, and nearby Paliton Beach is popular for its line of coconut trees, white sand, and snorkeling.  Now for the waterfalls: Lagaan Falls is less extravagant than many other waterfalls, but also less crowded. (Plus, it has a rope swing and a natural slide!) Cambugahay Falls is worth a visit, as well, because of its unique three-tiered structure. Next, go see the fascinating “century-old” balete tree, which really does look like it’s enchanted. Finally, drive around on a motorbike to see the mangrove trees, go cliff jumping at Salagdoong Beach, and check out the sea turtles (and hundreds of species of fish) at Apo Island. All in all, you can’t go wrong with Siquijor.   Camiguin is ultra-friendly and almost completely un-touristed, making it the perfect destination for a relaxing beach vacation. Not only is the area home to gorgeous beaches like the sandbar at White Island, but also countless other cool spots to explore. For example, there are more volcanoes on Camiguin per square km than on any other island on Earth, and hiking Mt. Vulcan is a great way to explore one. Go hunting for waterfalls like Binangawan, Katibawasan, or Tuwasan Falls, or for springs like Ardent Hot Springs and Santo Nino Cold Spring. Then, head to Mantigue Island Nature Park, where you can look for monkeys and cruise around in a glass-bottom boat. For water activities, two of the island’s snorkeling spots are unlike anything you’ve ever seen: the Giant Clam Sanctuary; and the Sunken Cemetery, a cemetery which slipped into the water due to a powerful earthquake in the 1870s and is now marked by a cross that looks like it is floating above the water. Bantayan Island, just north of Cebu, remains largely unknown to tourists. The island’s biggest draws are its warm aquamarine waters and powdery white beaches. Two of the best are Kota Beach and Paradise Beach.  Other things to explore include Ogtong Cave and Obo-ob Mangrove Eco Park, a mangrove forest which can be explored on foot along its bamboo walkway or even by kayak. Visit the historic Saints Peter and Paul Church, which dates back to the 16th century but was rebuilt in the mid 1800s. Explore the island on a bike, and if you’re feeling especially ambitious, you can even go skydiving! Bantayan would make for a great mix of adventure and relaxation.  The island (and region) of Bohol makes for a unique trip thanks to two things: tarsiers and Chocolate Hills.  Let me explain: tarsiers are small primates that look like a distant relative of the lemur, and they exist on only a few islands around the world. Bohol is one of those places. The Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary in Bohol (Corella) is worth a visit, as these wide-eyed little guys are both adorable and fascinating. The Chocolate Hills are hundreds of grassy hills rising sporadically out of the flat landscape of Bohol; they turn brown in the dry season and look just like mounds of chocolate scattered all over. Stretching on for miles, they make for a breathtaking view. Other things to do in Bohol include kayaking down one of the rivers — Abatan is usually uncrowded — and diving as the vibrant and diverse coral reefs nearby are breathtaking.   Caramoan, a quiet spot on the Caramoan Peninsula within Bicol, is still largely untouristed and therefore makes a more authentic Philippines visit than El Nido. Interestingly, the sleepy town was made known by the TV show Survivor, as several seasons of the show were filmed here and in nearby Goa.  The area boasts plenty of powdery beaches, caves, and even those limestone cliffs for which El Nido is famous. Caramoan also makes a great home base for some island-hopping: a cluster of more than ten islands sits just off the north shore of the peninsula, with a few more to the east, as well. Some of the most notable are Matukad, Lahos, and Bagieng. In terms of geographical makeup, Caramoan is very similar to El Nido, so it would make a perfect substitute.  After conversations with several friends who have done it, I’m now convinced I must experience the Tao expedition. Beginning in El Nido and ending in Coron (or vice versa, but prefer this way), the expedition largely avoids the crowds in both places by exploring the islands in between. Most of them are uninhabited and just have Tao camps set up. Passengers sail between each stop and camp and eat freshly caught seafood all along the way. It sounds like paradise, and still gives you a chance to check out Coron afterwards.  While this list is just 8 out of thousands, these options in the Philippines will give you a beautiful sense of the country, and without the crazy crowds of El Nido.  What are some of your favorite spots in the Philippines? All of these alternatives look stunning, but the Tao expedition is the one that drew me in the most! I live in Vancouver and know a lot of people from the Philippines. The photos they show me are just stunning! I am dying to try it. Everyone loves it! Looking to travel in June. Yes the wet season.Are there better/ worse places to go during this time. After quiet time, basic everythingThanksMichael I haven’t been there at that time of year but I generally feel that Southeast Asia is more lush, cheaper, and less touristy at that time of year. You might want to look into specific activities you’re interested in to make sure they happen in June and alter your itinerary accordingly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/swimming-with-whale-sharks/,Where in the World to Swim with Whale Sharks,Philippines,"Swimming with whale sharks is one of the most exciting and awe-inspiring aquatic experiences. Apart from swimming with humpback whales, shark swimming is my favorite ocean activity, in part due to how huge they are.  Not only are whale sharks the largest sharks in the ocean, they’re second only to some whale species when it comes to ocean animal size, and are the largest ‘fish in the sea’. These spotted and striped fellas can be as long as a school bus — 40 feet long or more – that’s up to three times as big as a great white! Gasp! Sharks? Aren’t those dangerous? Thankfully whale sharks are gentle giants: they have tiny teeth, and they don’t really use them anyway. Whale sharks are filter feeders, so they use their five-foot-wide mouths to eat mostly plankton. Since they are so massive, they live in practically no danger of being hunted by predators, so they have life spans similar to and exceeding those of humans, ranging from 70 to even 130 years! While whale sharks are found mostly in tropical seas, as they choose to live in warm waters, they can be seen all over the world and on five of the seven continents. Since they migrate, the best time to see them varies from place to place. Here are the best places around the globe to swim with whale sharks: Mexico is home to several different whale shark habitats. Off the coast of Cancun is Isla Mujeres, a popular spot for divers and snorkelers. From May to September, the whale sharks migrate south past the island, and the annual Whale Shark Festival takes place there every July.  Another option, the nearby Isla Holbox, is 40 miles northwest of Cancun and sees the same migration as Isla Mujeres. Holbox is actually home to one of the largest whale shark populations in the world. Meanwhile, the tiny Isla Contoy is a Mexican national park which regulates eco-tourism including diving with whale sharks. Whale sharks can be found around the Baja California region as well. La Paz, on the south and eastern coast of the Baja peninsula, sees whale sharks from November to May. In all of these locations, booking an excursion is easy!  The Gladden Spit and Silk Cayes Marine Reserve protects the central part of Belize’s Barrier Reef off the southern coast. From March to June, whale sharks gather in the waters of the reserve to feed. Swimming with the sharks is fairly easy, as several local tour companies run excursions with them. Prices seem to be higher here than in Mexico (at around $200) as some of them are SCUBA diving excursions, not just snorkeling trips.  Booking isn’t quite as straightforward, either: there are plenty of companies with tour listings online, but many do not display their prices or offer online booking. Also important to know is that dive operators can only work within the restrictions of the reserve, so it is best to book a spot on a trip well in advance, which might require picking up the phone and inquiring that way, or showing up in person if you have a bit more time to work with.  The tiny Isla del Caño, ten miles southwest of mainland Costa Rica, is a protected biological reserve with crystal clear waters. The island is rumored to be Costa Rica’s best spot for snorkeling, as swimmers can see turtles, rays, and other species of shark, too.  The whale sharks are believed to most likely visit the area June to September and November to January; however, this destination is certainly more “off the grid” than many others, so booking an excursion online to see the whale sharks here is somewhat difficult. Like many options on this list, it’s best to visit and organize in person.  The island of Utila, off the northern coast of Honduras, is one of the most famous whale shark viewing spots, as the sharks swim near to the shore all year long, not just for a few months. The island is also home to the Whale Shark and Oceanic Research Center, which studies the population and movement patterns of the sharks.  Roatan Island is another great spot to see the whale sharks, particularly between the months of May and September. The diving there is exceptional because the island’s proximity to the world’s second largest barrier reef results in diverse marine life. Since the islands are well-known for diving, booking a guide to see the whale sharks should be no trouble at all. A diving trip alone typically falls between $150 and $200. Coiba National Park is a protected marine reserve off the southwestern mainland coast of Panama. Here, whale sharks can be seen close to land from January to April. Tours to swim with the whale sharks run from Puerto Mutis, El Banco, or most commonly, the fishing village of Santa Catalina. Most diving trips seem to range around $150, while snorkeling trips are much cheaper at about $30, and many of these excursions are available for easy booking online. While the whale shark season is brief, the months of June through October bring orcas and humpbacks, so Coiba is a great destination for seeing marine life no matter when you visit.  Off the northwestern coast of Madagascar, the island of Nosy Be is home to large numbers of young whale sharks which come to feed in September through December. Countless other species besides whale sharks have made Nosy Be home, contributing to the island’s reputation for amazing diving.  Booking an excursion in Nosy Be is easy online, as underwater activities are the island’s greatest tourist pull. While Nosy Be is the most expensive destination in Madagascar, it still pales in comparison to many other places around the world: rates tend to hover around $75 for a one-day diving trip.   Mafia Island, off the east coast of Tanzania, offers an optimal whale shark spotting season from September/October to February/March, a little longer than Madagascar. The island sees a large population of whale sharks, which is unusual for how near the island is to the African continent.  While there are seasons of optimal viewing, like Utila, Mafia sees sharks all year long, making it an important destination for marine biological research. Booking a swim with the whale sharks costs about $60 to $100 and is possible online or in person.  Mozambique offers great opportunities to see and swim with whale sharks in Tofo, 300 miles northeast of the capital city of Maputo. Huge numbers of plankton guarantee one of the largest whale shark populations anywhere in the world. November through February is the best time to go, as waters are both clear and warm enough for great shark spotting. The whale sharks float close to the surface here, so even snorkelers should be able to see them without going too far below the surface.  Most of the dive tour companies do not offer online booking, unfortunately, but the sticker prices make up for it: a snorkeling trip to see whale sharks, manta rays, devil rays, dolphins, and turtles costs less than $60. In my case, after a SCUBA dive, my guide spotted some whale sharks and let me jump in, so it’s possible to see them on dive trips as well. There are just four dive companies in Tofo, all of which are easy to reach on foot from wherever you might be staying. A surge of plankton brings groups of whale sharks to the upper Red Sea region each May to July. The sharks appear mainly in the very north of the Red Sea (adjacent to Egypt), having migrated from the central Red Sea region (e.g., Sudan and Saudi Arabia), originating in large clusters in the southern part (near Djibouti). In Egypt, some popular spots are the city of Sharm El-Sheikh, which has clear waters perfect for diving, and the town of Marsa Alam, popular for its coral reefs. Several dive tours in each place are easily available for booking online, and most diving and snorkeling excursions cost around $50 to $100. Since Djibouti is situated on the southern part of the Red Sea, it is even closer to the Indian Ocean and therefore the ocean’s strong currents bring in all kinds of marine animals. Here you’ll find at least 200 marine species native to the country, and thanks to that biodiversity, whale sharks love to hang out along the Djibouti coast. They’re most visible from November to February, and the best places to see them are the Bay of Ghoubbet, an inlet which stretches nearly halfway into the country from the Indian Ocean, and the Island of the Devil, which is surrounded by plankton which attract the sharks.  Prices for day-long excursions hover around $100 for snorkeling and $150 for diving, and most tour companies do their booking online.   South Ari Atoll in the Maldives is a Marine Protected Area which sees whale sharks year round, rotating from one side of the island to the other depending on the season. Tours are available to swim with the sharks at all times of the year, so booking an excursion should be easy.  Prices usually center around $100 for a day-long diving trip. The Maldives Whale Shark Research Programme has even created an app which allows you to track whale shark sightings to better plan your trip! I had a fantastic experience with a whale shark here, swimming with the same one for over 45 minutes (without feeding). Compared to my super brief Mozambique experience, this one was quite magical, though there were tons of other tourists in the water with me.  While the most popular location for swimming with whale sharks in the Philippines is Oslob in Cebu, the practices for swimming with the sharks there are often questionable and can be harmful to the sharks themselves. Whale sharks don’t naturally gather there, so the ways in which tour guides use food to lure them to groups of tourists is highly unethical. Not to worry, there are other options that are more ethical! Donsol Bay, at the southern tip of island of Luzon, is a much better option thanks to the way locals protect the whale sharks. Donsol Bay has a “no diving – snorkeling only” rule, as the sharks are well visible to snorkelers and there is no need to further disturb the aquatic ecosystem. While the whale sharks do not hang out in the Philippines here year-round, they do spend a good half of the year here, from December to May. Tours are best booked in person.  The island of Ko Tao is the perfect spot for cheap but beautiful diving in the Gulf of Thailand, another destination where whale sharks hang out year-round. The island usually sees younger, smaller whale sharks which are often curious and playful with divers, as well as rays and turtles.  Here, seeing the whale sharks typically requires actual diving, not just snorkeling. However, a day-long diving trip only costs around $50 to $60! These are usually best booked in person.  Part of the Coral Coast of Western Australia, Ningaloo Reef is the world’s largest fringing coral reef. Ningaloo is home to more than 300 species of sea animals and sees large numbers of whale sharks from early spring to late fall. Here, they hang out just below the surface of the clear waters, so diving isn’t even necessary to see them.  Australia might be one of the most expensive destinations to swim with whale sharks, though: many tours have a sticker price of about $300 (here’s an option for $275, or even $196). Luckily, the tours are highly-rated and include transport, snacks, and professional photos.  Though rare, whale sharks can show up just about anywhere, like Hawaii, French Polynesia, and more.  If you do get the privilege to swim with them, please don’t touch, or chase, and just admire. There are few experiences as profound and beautiful as swimming with such a large, gentle creature.  *Some links in this post are affiliate links that support this site at no extra cost to you. If you do book a tour, consider booking through one of these links. Many thanks! Such amazing creatures!! I went to Belize last year in hopes of swimming with them but the season ended up starting a bit late and they weren’t there yet! Hoping to see them in Mozambique this fall! Thanks for the comprehensive post 🙂 I love Mozambique. Have the best time!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/solo-travel-safety/,Someone Tried to Break Into My Hotel Room When I Was Traveling Solo,Philippines,"Yep, it happened. Last month in the Philippines, as I was dozing off in a little bungalow on a beach that you can only boat to, I felt the walls and ceiling of my room shake. At first I passed it off as an animal, until I saw someone shine a light into my room and try to open the door from the low balcony. I panicked, and the only thing I thought to do, was shine a light right back at them to let them know that someone was inside. Thankfully it worked and they disappeared, and when I heard the owner walking through 20 minutes later, I opened the door to let her know. She looked shocked. “I… I have no words,” she stammered. In the 10 years that the villas have been there, predicated on an agreement with the locals who live there, there had never been any threat to the set of bungalows before. It seemed implausible and yet, it happened. I was shaken up for a couple of days. I wondered: Should I leave? Should I let it go? In the end I stayed, but I learned a few things from the experience that are at the top of my mind now. These are the mistakes I made and what I could have done differently: While I am not victim shaming myself, I acknowledge that I’ve gotten a bit lazy. It’s always when I get ambivalent and break my own rules that I have issues, like walking alone at night in Nepal and getting robbed in Berlin. Both sucked, and neither one is entirely my fault, but both could’ve been avoided. Though I could not have avoided this situation, there is more I could’ve done to make myself safer. When I was interviewing solo female travelers for my 31 Tips for Solo Female Travel Safely and Conquering Mountains, a couple of women mentioned carrying a doorjamb and a personal alarm. Although there were no police around on that beach, had I made a lot of noise, perhaps the owners or other villagers could’ve caught the wannabe thief. Since I have no way of letting anyone know while it was happening, I was just stuck stewing until I heard the owner walking by some time later. Although this was a sliding glass door, a doorjamb would protect you in most situations. With a doorjamb up against the door, it can’t be opened. *Note that I don’t recommend mace or pepper spray since most airlines will not permit you to carry it on board or even put it in checked luggage. In some places, like the EU, it’s also considered a concealed weapon.  If I had needed to bolt, I could’ve run out the other door with a flashlight and my shoes nearby. But that’s not how I set it up. I tend to sleep unclothed, so that would have delayed me or would’ve forced me to run outside naked in a pretty conservative country. Two choices I don’t love. Thankfully my phone was nearby enough that I could use it as a flashlight, but that was about it. I’ve started practicing self-defense after this situation. I already knew a few things but I think it’s important to take it even a step further. I don’t believe that the person trying to come in wanted anything to do with me, but having the skills is helpful no matter where you are in the world, and in the worst case scenario, it’s good to know a thing or two. This is not to say that I did everything wrong. I did a lot right, too. The best thing I did was to lock the door instead of assuming that I could sleep with the door open or be relaxed enough to leave things unlocked. I always lock my doors no matter what, even if people tell me they never have an issue or that it’s not necessary. After an initial period of being a bit scared, I also didn’t let it harden me to the beautiful place I was at and make me fearful and mistrustful of the people on Tablas. There are bad eggs everywhere, and desperation drives people to do things they would probably rather not. Following that, a reader reached out to tell me that she had been following my footsteps on Tablas and had accidentally lost her bag with her money and camera in it, and that it was actually returned to her in its entirety! It almost feels that everything is canceled out and in harmony again with that amazing gesture. In the end I haven’t decided to stop trusting when I travel. I don’t want to constantly live in fear – that’s not in alignment with my view of the world or how I want to feel. I’d rather assume that everyone is good and doing their best. It didn’t scare me out of traveling solo, because that could’ve happened no matter what, and has happened to me several times at home in California, anyway (it’s the place I’ve had the most home break-ins – 3 – and the most theft). However it did make me aware of the ways in which I have gotten lazy. I am responsible for my own safety when I travel. Especially when in such remote places, I have to remember that it’s still not time to totally let my guard down. VERY good reminder post!  I especially like the door jamb, and it’s a better idea than moving a chair in front of the door.  What do you suggest for sliding glass doors? Hey Scott. If you don’t mind my thought on it as a fellow reader. You could purchase an adjustable security bar or dowel that blocks opening it in its tracks. They are usually, even when adjusted down to minimum length, around 2 feet long but check it out and see if you could find one that can fit in your luggage or is worth the trouble. They added security to my childhood home. If you have a choice of a floor then go for at least 2 stories high as Kristin suggests, at least that might help with sliding back patio doors. Happy travels! Kristin –  Glad you’re ok! And love your perspective on this! I was just talking yesterday about how, looking back, I’ve done some risky stuff I’d never recommend lol. But you learn from it and keep moving on. This is a great reminder to anyone who may have gotten a little too complacent, thank you <3 I think we all do! There’s a lot I can’t go out and tell people to repeat but then again, you can’t be too fearful or you miss out on so much. My granfather used to travel a lot as a constuction worker. I would sometimes visit my grandparents, and, if he was coming home from a job, watch him unpack. He would always pull this wedge of wood out of his toiletry kit. I asked him about it when I was 9 or so and he got very serious and said, if I ever traveled to always carry one of them. When I took my first solo trip abroad, he reminded me of this and got me some plastic door stops from the dollar store. I always carry them and put them in when I get into a room. I always lock doors and close bolts.I’m glad it didn’t sour your time there, but I am also happy that you had locked the door. I can’t tell you how many people forget that. I believe that most people are good, or, at the very least, don’t want to harm others. When traveling, whether alone, with others, male or female, you have to watch out. Grandpa knows best! Thank you SO much for posting this! I traveled for over a year alone (with tons of inspo from your blog) and a year after coming home did my first solo trip again to Costa Rica. I had been so lucky on my long term trip mostly through Asia that I also “got lazy” and took an offer for a ride home on a motorbike on NYE (something that happened in Ubud all the time no problem). But I got real trusting of people and let my guard down a bit. Long story short – the man sped away with me on the back of the bike, took me down a dirt road where I genuinely thought I would die. He ended up speeding away probably due to the screaming and fight I was putting up and I was relatively unharmed. I shared this story on a thread or two for this exact purpose – not to make others scared to travel alone but as a friendly check in. Got mixed responses, a good amount telling people I was an idiot for putting myself in the situation.  We take for granted when we travel alone and nothing bad happens, that you almost forget that bad things CAN happen. This was the reason I told my story, so it’s incredible to see you sharing yours also on a bigger stage.  THANK YOU for being real. As a travel blogger it’s your literal bread and butter to promote beautiful experiences – so I truly appreciate you checking people in and being authentic. One of the reasons I followed you before my big trip and will continue to do so as solo travel is a little bit more far and few in between. I’m so sorry people shamed you for that incident. People on the internet can be so cruel without thinking about how they are also messy, clumsy human beings sometimes too. Glad that you were OK and you know what? I got on a motorbike in Bali, too. Didn’t even think about it. I might have taken that same trust to Costa Rica too. Glad we’re both OK! Kristin I am so glad you are okay. I just ordered a personal alarm. Thanks for sharing and watching out for us…your fellow travel sisters.xoxo So glad that this helped you! Glad you safe 🙏🏽    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/palawans-best-things-to-do-an-awesome-itinerary/,Palawan’s Best Things To Do: An Awesome Itinerary,Philippines,"Palawan in the Philippines is a vacation unto itself. Full of island hopping adventures, dramatic cliffs, hidden lagoons, underwater rivers, and white sand beaches, you have to put in a concerted effort not to find more things to do on Palawan than you have time for. The following itinerary has some of the best things to do on Palawan beginning from what is usually the starting point for most visitors – Puerto Princesa: Possibly your first stop in Palawan, thanks to the convenient airport, Puerto Princesa has two major things to do that make it worth stopping in for a day or two. I stayed at Blue Palawan beach resort and thought it was decent. The restaurant was pretty good and the room was nice, too. They also offer free airport transport. It’s not the best place I’ve ever stayed, but neither is Puerto Princesa, to be honest! Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park: Though not exactly in Puerto Princesa, the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and contains the second longest underground river in the world. It is touristy and it takes quite a while to get there from Puerto Princesa, but when else are you going to get the chance to see such a thing? Honda Bay: Since I only had a day in Puerto Princesa, I chose to island hop in Honda Bay, which is about a 30-minute tricycle ride north of the city. There are plenty of options to do this as an organized tour, but I really wanted to do it independently, which worked out cheaper, too. You can read more about the islands, see what they look like, and learn how to do a Honda Bay DIY trip here. Most people head from Puerto Princesa to El Nido. I have full directions on how to do that using a bus, van, or flight here. You can also stop in Port Barton on the way, or go from El Nido if you had been there first. See below for more details: El Nido is arguably Palawan’s most famous stop. When you head there and see the lagoons and limestone cliffs, you’ll understand why. There’s nowhere in the world quite like El Nido. That said, it’s also a tourist favorite, so don’t expect to get it all to yourself. The easiest way to get to El Nido is to fly, either from Puerto Princesa or from Manila. I have more information on how to get there here. I stayed on Corong Corong Beach, which is slightly less touristy than El Nido town. It was a small 4-villa resort called El Nido Overlooking and I thought it was perfect. The Birdhouse was also pretty magical. Most people go island hopping in El Nido. If you don’t island hop at least one day, you’re missing out on most of the magic of El Nido. The island hopping is pretty rigid in its organization, with tours named A-D with the same stops on each. If you take a private tour you can customize things a bit more, though it’s a pretty penny. There are also great places to watch the sunset, do yoga, and check out other beaches and a waterfall. Read more at the links below: Tour A Tour B All of the Things to do in El Nido  When making our way through Palawan, the place I was most excited to visit was Port Barton. From what we had read online, it was meant to be much more secluded and far less developed than most other parts of Palawan, and  I was not disappointed! It has just as much of the beauty and charm of El Nido and Coron, but with far fewer backpackers. Getting to Port Barton is very easy. Most get there from El Nido or Puerto Princesa. The cost for a 3 and a half hour minibus transfer from El Nido was 500PHP per person. Though Port Barton is still very much up and coming, it has developed a lot in the last 12 months. They finally got 24 hour electricity at the end of 2018, and there are now a lot more homestays there than there were before. We stayed at Eashanti’s Place and I would definitely recommend it. However, if you are into partying and drinking late into the night, then the number one backpacker hostel for cheap drinks is CocoRico Hostel Bar and Restaurant. They have free rum and coke for an hour every day and are blasting music late into the night. For me, I much preferred strolling along the beach and dining in the many peaceful restaurants with seating literally right on the beach. There is so much to do there, with the most popular activity being the day long island hopping tour which takes you to some awesome snorkelling spots and to incredible beaches. One stop even offers the chance to swim with sea turtles, which we weren’t able to do anywhere else in Palawan. Some other activities to consider doing when in Port Barton include:● Visiting White Beach● Enjoying the sunset from Port Barton’s main beach● Hiking to Pamuayan Falls● Taking a boat ride and trek to Bigaho Falls – Bradley of Dream Big, Travel Far  If playing castaway on a private island in the Philippines is on your bucket list, look no further than Taytay, a small island that’s just off the coast of northeast Palawan. Away from the crowds of El Nido, this Island provides quiet, solitude and a back-to-nature approach to island life in the Philippines. Taytay was once the capital of Palawan during the Spanish colonial occupation, and although there’s not much to do in the town itself, it’s a useful jumping off point for island exploration, and there are reportedly some nice waterfall treks just to the north. You can take a shuttle from Puerto Princesa to Taytay, which takes about four hours. If you want a private transfer the resort can help you arrange that, but the best value option is to take one of the regular shared shuttles. From Taytay you’ll need to get a private boat from the resort (pre-arrange this) – there are no public ferries as this is a private island. Accessed by private ferry from the port of Taytay, Flower Island Eco Resort is the only building on this small island, and has been constructed out of low-impact materials. Mid-Range beach huts (mostly ventilated using the breeze) front the beach, which if you come during low season you may well have to yourself (or at most to a few other hotel guests). The resort’s main mission is to preserve the island and surrounding nature through tourism. It’s largely self-sufficient and much of the food is grown on the island (or fished by line from the end of the hotel’s pier). To reduce food waste, each day has a different, surprise menu, where you get the best and freshest. We went to visit the Save the Palawan Seas Foundation on a nearby island, which the resort mentioned above supports. The foundation has been campaigning to increase patrols against dynamite fishing (a huge threat to the coral in this part of the world as fish stocks decline due to pollution and local fishermen resort to more and more desperate measures to fetch a decent catch). They also teach villagers methods to grow their own vegetables at home, without pesticides, in order to reduce poverty. Spending an hour or two with the volunteers was a memorable part of our stay here and showed us some of the challenges and opportunities that lie in store for Islanders here. Back on Flower Island, there’s a spa, cocktail bar, kayaks and snorkeling equipment aplenty and so we took to the water to see in an incredible array of color under the surface. The resort also offers tours to a nearby Pearl Farm which provides an interesting insight into how the pearl industry works, and how this delicate process is being threatened by climate change. – Ellie of Soul Travel Blog Though Coron and El Nido are quite similar, they each have their own striking features that set them apart from one another, and both are worth visiting. Island hopping in Coron is quite magical, with islands that have caves, hidden lagoons (like the Twin Lagoon), and even quiet tree houses. “If traveling from El Nido, it’s possible to take a ferry to Coron Town Proper, which takes a couple of hours. You can also fly from El Nido or Manila into the airport, which will require a tricycle, taxi, or van ride of about 30 minutes to your accommodation. You can also take a TAO expedition, described in point 6 below. I stayed at Sanctuaria Treehouses on the more northwestern, quiet side of Busuanga Island, just outside of Coron for two days and closer to Coron Town Proper for two days at Sophia’s Garden Resort and thought splitting time was the best way to do it. It gave me access to some of the farther, less visited islands at the beginning of my trip and proximity to the more popular Coron Island across the bay for the latter half. Like El Nido, you haven’t seen Coron if you haven’t island hopped (mostly because the island of Coron is not on the same island as Coron town, confusingly!). It’s a bit easier to go about organizing your own boat and picking your own stops in Coron than El Nido, which I detailed in this post. You can also find other things to do like hiking and even a saltwater hot spring – one of few in the world. The SCUBA diving is considered the best in the Philippines in Coron thanks to the WWII wrecks and Apo Reef as well. I can vouch. If you’re trying to decide between Coron and El Nido, I go into the benefits and drawbacks of both in this post.  Taking an expedition with TAO Philippines is a great way to experience some of the most beautiful islands of Palawan. TAO Philippines is a locally owned company that runs multi-day island hopping tours through the remote islands of Northern Palawan. They offer both 3 and 5-day tours, which start and end in El Nido or Coron. There is no itinerary or plan for the expedition. The days are spent swimming in turquoise waters, snorkeling through vibrant coral reefs, chilling on secluded beaches, and fishing off the back of the boat. At the end of each day, they supply drinks to enjoy while watching the gorgeous sunset. TAO has 13 base camps on remote islands throughout Palawan and each day the team decides where to sleep that night. Accommodations are in gorgeous bamboo huts overlooking the ocean. Three delicious meals are served each day, which usually involve fresh seafood caught just before it’s served. What I love about TAO is that they are more than a regular tour company, it’s a social enterprise. They use tourism as a tool to build resilient communities throughout Palawan. During the tour, you get many opportunities to interact with the local communities and see the various projects TAO has started on the islands. The cost of the tour is $545 USD but well worth every penny. TAO is one of the most unique tours I’ve ever done and a great example of responsible tourism. If you want to join a TAO Expedition, you can book online through their website or visit their office in El Nido or Coron. Taking a TAO Expedition was the highlight of my time in the Philippines, it’s the perfect tour for those looking for an adventure you can feel good about. – Lora of Explore with Lora Cuyo is often described as Philippines hidden gem and now I can see why. The oldest town in Palawan, Cuyo is full of rich culture which has evolved from both native and Spanish influences. Cuyo is perfect for those looking to relax on the white sandy beaches, take a dip in the crystal clear waters, eat tasty Filipino food, and interact with the locals who believe in a simple, carefree life. Cuyo is the largest island of the Cuyo Archipelago with the biggest population and is situated in between Palawan and Panay. The most common option of transport is by ferry, however, the airline Juan Air also runs flights to Cuyo. We choose the overnight ferry option to save a night on accommodation, which took around 15 hours. Yes, that sounds like a long time, but don’t worry we managed a few hours’ sleep! The ferry is comfortable and they provide snacks, but if you’re a fussy eater like me, I’d suggest you take your own. There’s never a bad time to visit Cuyo, however if you want to miss the rainfall it’s best to visit November until March when the weather tends to be drier and cooler. However, during rainy seasons you’ll only be greeted by short sharp bursts, which brings a period of wanted coolness! If you’re lucky enough to visit Cuyo during August you’ll get your experience the Cuyo Fiesta, full of dance, colour, and music to celebrate. If you’re looking for a sweet place to stay, then you should check out the Anino Kite Resort. Just one mile from the airport this top accommodation on Cuyo offers WiFi, clean rooms and a free breakfast. You can hire a boat for the day and explore the many islands situated around Cuyo to get some amazing photos, and the best part is that you’ll have the place all to yourself, unlike the famous El Nido and Coron (although, there are some clever ways to ditch the crowds in Coron!). For the adrenaline junkies out there, Cuyo is an awesome place to learn kitesurfing. Swimming and relaxing on the beach are great, but watch out for the sea urchins – I’d recommend water shoes! Just 300 meters from the pier, St Augustine’s Church was constructed by the Spanish missionaries in the 17th century, and its architecture is simple yet worth taking a look at. The church remains the most popular place in town to attend mass. Finally, we recommend hiking up Mt Aguado. Enjoy this 4km hike starting from the pier to take in 360 degree views of Cuyo Island, as well as the statues along the way telling the story of Christ. – Louis of The Northern Boy  Many places claim to be ‘off-the-beaten-track’ but Rizal, on Palawan’s south-west coast, really fits the bill. With many uninhabited beach coves lining the coastline, you’ll no doubt find a secluded spot to enjoy the unspoiled white sandy beaches, calm azure waters and some genuine peace and quiet – you’ll likely be the only tourist for miles.   It may not be one of the most famous spots in the Philippines, but the Tabon Caves is one of the most significant. It’s worth visiting to learn more about the important history of this site – and enjoy the stunning natural scenery that comes as a bonus! The easiest way to visit Tabon Caves is by tour from Puerto Princesa. If you shop around, you’ll be able to find one that’s not much more expensive than doing it independently. If you would like to do it yourself, you can get the bus to the small town of Quezon and go across by boat (about 800 pesos for the boat, with up to 6 people). There are only a couple of guesthouses in Quezon (such as Noc’s Pension House), so it’s possible to stay overnight if you want. But unless there are other things you would like to do in the area, it’s probably better to base yourself closer to (or in) Puerto Princesa and do Tabon Caves as a day trip. There are two reasons why Tabon Caves are such an important Palawan site – one about nature and one about man. When it comes to nature, it’s easy to see for yourself. These beautiful caves open up in front of you, offering an easy exploration into caverns filled with interesting rock formations. Around them is a lush green jungle and a stunning coastline with a couple of beaches for swimming and picnics. But it’s the history that makes them so special. It’s here that some of the oldest evidence of humans in Asia have been found. There was a famous discovery of the skeleton of the ‘Tabon Man’, that’s thought to be about 30,000 years old (and turned out to actually be a woman). And another fossilised bone fragment found here is estimated to be up to 50,000 years old! When you stand in these caves or walk through the darkened tunnels, you can almost imagine what it would have been like for early man to shelter here at night and eat the meals that they had hunted in the jungles around them.There are about 30 protected caves here at the Tabon Caves complex but only seven are usually open to the public. They are easily accessible and there’s no climbing involved – there are even stairs in some of the steeper ones. It’s more of a museum than an adventure activity – but the nature has been quite well-preserved. – Michael of Time Travel Turtle  Balabac is a group of islands in the southernmost tip of Palawan. Once an off-beat location, it’s becoming a more popular destination due to its virgin islands and sand bars. To get to Balabac, you need to take a local flight to Puerto Princesa, Palawan. From there, commute to either Rio Tuba or Buliluyan port, where boats can take you to Balabac. To get to the islands, you can arrange for an island hopping tour. Some locals also offer full packages, which include transfer from/to Balabac, accommodation and food. For the accommodation, you can either camp overnight on the islands or stay in modest inns in mainland Balabac island. For the first, it’s best to consult with your boat operator as some islands aren’t ideal for overnight stays due to permission issues or insects. Once you’re here the one thing you can do is relax and island hop. You can visit Onuk Island, a private island with white sand, blue water and where you can freedive to see giant clams and turtles. Onuk Island is the most sought-after islands in Balabac. You can also see Candaraman Island, another great beach that can easily beat popular tropical beaches around the world, and which has an area called “starfish alley” where you can take pictures with literally dozens of starfishes; Camiaran Island, a pinkish-sand beach; Mansalangan sand bar, with its picturesque sand formation; and Punta Sebaring, which has one of the finest, whitest sands in the country. Island hopping can easily be done in 3 days. Balabac is also known for whale sharks sightings and some higher end liveaboard diving opportunities. Another thing that you can enjoy in Balabac is fresh, cheap seafood. Fish, shrimp, and crabs can be bought early in the morning from local fishers or, during island hopping tours, caught and/or cooked by your boat operator. – Tara of Tara Lets Anywhere I hope this itinerary gives you an idea of some of the best things to do in Palawan. It’s a gorgeous province of the Philippines with tons of variety, some very popular spots, and some off the beaten path gems. Hi! I love your posts, so clear and interesting! I am going for the first time to Philippines and i am really excited. However i only have 8 days this time as I am going to do a yoga teaching for a month right after.  my question is: If you are first time travelling to Philippines and have only 8 days should I do 1. Port Barton and el Nido   or   2. Siargao ? I am a lot into exploring and ideally less crowded more paradise like. I dont need any ‘luxury’ and I am going by my self end of Feb. any suggestions? I know El Nido is like ‘THE’ place but i am not sure about how busy and tourity it might feel. In the other side Siargao seems really nice but not sure if the beauty would compare to el Nido. thanks! If you want it to be less touristy and you’re cool with getting on a motorbike to explore then consider Siargao, or if you want even less touristy then take a look at Siquijor or Camiguin!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-10-best-things-to-do-in-coron/,The 10 BEST Things to do in Coron,Philippines,"Coron is a limestone island located in the province of Palawan. It boasts seven lakes, one of which happens to be nationally-acclaimed as the cleanest lake in the Philippines, and is  home to some of the world’s most beautiful white sand beaches and clear blue waters. It’s one of those places that will remind you that paradise really does exist! Coron is especially famous for its World War II wreck diving sites – many of which have put Coron on multiple lists ranking among the top dive spots around the globe. Although a lot of the beauty of Coron lies beneath the surface, there’s no shortage of gorgeous scenery above the surface! The following are the 10 best things to do in Coron: Island hopping is an absolute must do in Palawan. With Coron or El Nido you’ll get your fix and then some, but if you want to get the most out of these gorgeous places you really can’t skip either one. That’s just how it goes in the Philippines given that there are thousands of islands and each one has its own special beauty. Many of the places listed below can be reached via island hopping and if you choose to book privately you can pick which ones you visit. Tours in Coron aren’t as systematic as El Nido but there are some great options and day trips that you can book online or in the town. If you are traveling with a group, it is a huge advantage to see these places through a private tour because you can pick your own itinerary and mix and match the destinations – as well as have better chances of avoiding crowds. This is what I did and even splitting the boat only in half pricewise was still worth it to me. You can read all about island hopping in Coron, including how to book a private boat, here. Diving is an awesome activity for so many reasons – I love that it’s something that you can pick up at pretty much any point in your life and it will undoubtedly show you a new perspective of the world. If you’ve ever caught yourself thinking “I wish I could do that” or “I wish I would have learned that”… you can! There are dive schools and sites all over the Philippines that cater to beginning divers and advanced divers alike, including in Coron. For Coron’s wrecks, however, you’ll need your advanced open water certification, and Nitrox wouldn’t hurt. Coron offers six large, intact WWII shipwreck dives as well as one of the world’s most unique lake diving locations. From underwater mountains in Kayangan Lake to wrecks covered in corals and sponges, there is a lot to see beneath the surface in Coron. I’ve dived all of the above and saw turtles, sharks, tons of fish, and some beautiful, big wrecks. You can learn more about my liveaboard diving experience here. However you can dive from town as well if you’re not ready to commit to a boat. Twin Lagoon gets its name because of the limestone wall dividing the water into two lagoons. Entering the lagoon, expect to be completely blown away by the towering cliffs above, and the fish surrounding their bases below. The wall that separates the lagoon into two “twin” lagoons can be swum through during low tide, or climbed over with a ladder to reach a hidden lagoon on the other side. This is a destination on one of the island hopping tours, but I’m reminding you of it because it is really a place you shouldn’t miss in Coron! You can read my full review + tips for visiting the Twin Lagoon here. Kayangan Lake is one of the most popular and photographed places in Coron – for good reason of course. It is an absolutely gorgeous mix of lush forest scenery and sparkling water that is 70% freshwater and 30% saltwater. Because of the popularity of this place, the key to getting the most enjoyment out of it is to beat the crowds and go early. The hike up is short, but you’re in the Philippines, so yes, it is going to get hot and sweaty… nothing a dip in the lake can’t fix! I visited early in the morning the first time I went and there was nobody around. I went in the afternoon this time around and was blown away by how crowded it was! Alternatively, head to Barracuda Lake in the afternoon. The tour boats have often moved on by then and it’s just as pretty, if not more or less the same thing, IMHO. When it comes to perfectly white sandy beaches, Banul delivers. It’s best to aim for this beach after the tours have left, which is after lunch, so that you can get it all to yourself. The unique rocks on the shore make for a stunning photo op, and I just loved how laid back it was in comparison to the other major beach stops on Coron Island – CYC and Beach 91. This short and sweet hike is a perfect first adventure when arriving in Coron town. It is always nice to see a new place from its highest viewpoint to take it all in, and to help you understand the lay of the land a little. From town, take the 742 steps up to Mt. Tapyas, particularly for sunset. It only takes about 10-15 minutes to get to the summit so if that doesn’t get you your hiking fix, you can walk out the back for a while to explore the trails that pass through the rolling hills. If your legs are feeling the burn from the Mt. Tapyas hike or if you just need to relax after a long day of island hopping, find your way to Maquinit Hot Springs. One of the only few saltwater hot springs in the world, Maquinit is a two-tiered pool built into a mangrove forest filled with natural hot water that is fed by an underground volcano. Maquinit is located about 20-30 minutes outside of Coron town and easily reachable by tricycle or scooter. The best time to visit is in the evening when the sun’s heat is less intense, plus going later in the day is a double win because Maquinit is home to some stunning sunsets. Entry to the springs is 200 PHP and an hour is plenty of time for most people. There’s also an interesting little half day trip that will take you to Mt. Tapyas, the hot springs, and a few other Coron landmarks for only 10 USD if you’d rather not organize transport on your own. Experiencing local food and the traditional ways of consuming it is a great way to invite a culture into your life and your travels. A boodle fight is generally a large meal that uses no silverware and no dishes. Basically, a bounty of food spread along a table that is protected by banana leaves.Rice, fish, veggies, meats, and a variety of other seafood are typical of what you would expect to see in a boodle fight. It’s messy, tasty, and most likely something you wouldn’t attempt at home. You’ll find options for this in El Nido, too. This is another one to add to the list of places in the Philippines that are magical and completely otherworldly. Breathtaking blues, awe-striking greens, endless limestone cliffs – does this even sound real? Plus, Black Island has far fewer visitors than the other islands around Coron. For me that was a huge win, and meant I stayed nearly all day. This is honestly one of the best things to do in Coron. There’s great snorkeling, trees for shade, and best of all, there’s a cave with a lagoon you can swim in! I had it all to myself for almost an hour. Now usually, a boat here from Coron town would be pretty expensive, but if you stay on the other side of Busuanga (the island Coron town is located on) for a couple of days, you can get a boat for MUCH cheaper. That brings me to my next tip: The Sanctuaria Treehouse was a highlight of my Coron experience. I loved how far it was from the hustle and bustle of Coron town. I had a sweeping view over the mangroves, which I went swimming in at dusk, an easy-to-organize boat to Black Island for less than half of what it cost in town, and a laid back, magical experience for a couple of days. I highly recommend spending some time here and island hopping from this vantage point for a different Coron experience than what most people have. I hope this helps you to have a somewhat unique experience when in Coron – especially with the last two tips. I have a lot more to say about how to make island hopping more enjoyable, but that’s a post of its own, which you can read here. Enjoy the soft white sand, warm water, and postcard moments.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/coron-island-hopping/,Coron Island Hopping: How to Ditch the Crowds,Philippines,"If you’ve been seeing dreamy photos of Coron Island over the years – Instagram just sneaking them right into your feed – then like me, this place has probably nestled itself in your mind. That’s why when I went back to the Philippines for a third time, I knew that I would be island hopping around Coron. This was actually not my first time in the area. Back in 2014, I jumped on a liveaboard dive boat and went scuba diving all around the area. But weirdly enough, I have almost no memory of the islands, and I had to fix that! I spent three days island hopping around Coron and got some juicy insider tips to help you have a more enjoyable experience with smaller crowds. Without further ado: The following itineraries are broken down into what is the most logical for each day of your trip. Depending on where you’re leaving from, some places are going to be quite far and therefore more expensive. I have some ways of helping with that too. Let’s start with what’s closest to Coron town: Coron Island. This is one of the most popular destinations for island hopping in Coron and every tour boat in the vicinity will go there. The entrance fee is 200 pesos and trust me when I say that it will be very popular. That said, if you can manage to arrive before 8am, you can more or less get it all to yourself. Just make sure that you organize the tickets the day before for both this one and the next one on the list. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time to explore the area since it’s large and there’s much swimming to do! You can read my full review of the Twin Lagoon here. The other most popular place on this list, this brackish lake is magical in the morning hours, but by 10am it’s packed with people. I’ve seen it in both scenarios, scuba diving in it back in 2014 and this time after it became instafamous. These days, you’re required to wear a life jacket, just like in Twin Lagoon. However at the lake unlike at the lagoon, there will be someone to enforce it. Unless, that is, you get there right when it opens at 7:30am. Were I to do it over again, I would get there early but for some reason on this trip I just really valued sleeping in! What can a girl do? I actually liked Barracuda Lake more than Kayangan Lake because I had it to myself for a while by going in the afternoon after the tour boats had mostly moved on. It’s less popular, so to me it was more beautiful and pretty darn similar. I enjoyed freediving at both of them, and loved the little needlefish that hug the top of the water! I headed to Banul Beach In the afternoon, after the tours that stop there for lunch had already left. It’s a small cove with white sand beaches and though grassy and not perfect for snorkeling, it is absolutely perfect for chilling. Most tours will also go to Beach 91 instead, which I don’t feel is any better than Banul, but it certainly is more crowded! This old WWII wreck is one of few in Coron that you can actually swim to rather than needing dive gear. As an avid diver who has done most of the wrecks in the area, it’s not nearly as impressive as what you can find if you dive, but as snorkeling goes, it’s alright. There are plenty of striped fish around the surface as well. Realistically, if you can’t freedive you won’t be able to see much since the wreck is a good 10 to 12 meters down. However if you’re still interested, my pro tip is to go in the afternoon. I had it for a while all to myself! A favorite snorkeling spot, this is a good one to head up in the morning if you don’t want crowds around. I realize that everything on this list would be best to visit it in the morning, but if I were you I would put the Twin Lagoon first if you organize the boat for 7am, followed by Kayangan and then this one, to best assure you get some solitude. This island and the next three on this list are all a bit farther from Coron and therefore it takes quite a while to get there. You want to head out earlier in the day and instead of combining this with any Coron Island spots, you’ll want to combine it with the next two. This is a very popular place to visit nonetheless, so make it the first place that you stop. It’s a breathtaking white sand beach island with palm trees, but to be honest, I’d seen a lot of those by the time I got to Coron so this is not an island I visited. This is one I wish I had seen because, as I’ve established previously, I am a big-time sandbar enthusiast. This is where the tours usually stop for lunch, so if you get there before or after, you have a better chance of some solitude. Another beautiful white sand beach, Banana Island is all about chilling in the hammocks provided on the far side of the island. If they’re all taken when you arrive, people come and go so it won’t take long to get your turn! My biggest pro tip, and a spot that I haven’t seen on any of the other blogs about Coron, is Black Island. Perhaps that’s why it’s so under the radar, it’s far from town but you could easily spend an entire day just on this island, which I did! To get there from town it’s a minimum of 7600 pesos, which is probably why so few people go. However for me to go from the treehouse I stayed in at the top of the island (more on that later), I only paid 3500 for my boat. Black Island has it all: uncrowded snorkeling, a big white sand beach, and a few other inlets that you can swim to, and a cave that you can swim in! I found this particularly exciting, because I got to go swimming in a beautiful blue lagoon in a cave and there was nobody else around. This was the perfect secluded Coron island hopping experience I’d been dreaming of. This is why the islands I previously mentioned just before this one were not as appealing to me, because I already felt like I got a secluded and beautiful experience at Black Island. I’d highly recommend you split up your stay on Busuanga (the island Coron town is on) between the top side of the island where I was, and Coron town so that you get the best of both worlds. I did all of my island hopping in Coron, and El Nido too for that matter, on private boats. When possible, I would share them with others, which took the cost down significantly. The big benefit of taking your own boat is that you can come and go when you want to, customizing your itinerary as you please. You can also organize the boat to leave much earlier in the day so that you get to experience the popular places without the crowds. If you take a group tour, you’ve got a crowd built in with you and you’ll more or less be going to the same places at the same time as everyone else. That said, the group tours are significantly cheaper, particularly if you’re a solo traveler. The group tours include all of the entrance fees to the islands and a pretty good food spread. The pricing for private boats doesn’t include any of that. Still, if you can afford it, I always prefer the flexibility of a private boat. The costs are as follows: Alternatively you can book the group tours on Klook, the cheapest option I know of both in El Nido and Coron: I had the best experience out of all of my Palawan boat experiences by just going straight to the dock (tell the tricycle driver you want to go to Calamian dock and he’ll know what you mean), and getting a 2700 peso boat and asking him to take us anywhere where there weren’t tourists. This is how I enjoyed Barracuda Lake and snorkeled the wreck without other people around. I love the flexibility and it’s worth it to me to pay for that. If you do book a private boat and you want to go early, you’ll need to organize it the day before. Make sure to do so before 5pm so that you can secure tickets to Kayangan Lake! It may require some coaxing in the morning on your end to get things going, just stay patient and friendly and I’d even preemptively offer a tip to make it happen as early as possible. Be sure to bring snacks and water along with you, unless you’re doing a group tour that involves lunch. Near the dock there are little shops that have cashews and dried mango and that was perfect for me! You’ll also find coconuts and snacks for sale on the islands but they’re meager and it’s best to bring along food from town with you. You’ll also want to bring along snorkeling gear, which you can rent for 150 pesos for a mask and snorkel and 150 for a set of fins. I brought my own mask from home and would suggest you do the same. You can be more sure of the quality and won’t have to pay the equivalent of 3 US dollars every single day that you go island hopping. It can also be a good idea to bring along a dry bag (I use this one) if you want to be able to take photos, especially if kayaking in the lagoons. All of these photos were shot with a GoPro HERO7 Black, and my DJI Mavic 2 Pro. You can read more about my camera gear here. Also be sure to bring along sunscreen, as you’ll have your back to the sun often on this trip. It’s also helpful to bring along your own beach towel. If you’re there in April or May, a rash guard is a great idea due to the small jellyfish. I got annihilated in the Twin Lagoon! As mentioned previously in this article, it’s a great idea to split your stay between two places on different sides of the island. I stayed at Sanctuaria Treehouses for my first two days, organizing the boat to Black Island from there, and then moved to town for my second two days, which brought me closer to Coron Island and the Twin Lagoon. Here’s a full guide to the magical treehouse:  At Sanctuaria you can also kayak through the mangroves or just enjoy the peace and quiet. It’s so nice and secluded, it was just what I needed after hectic El Nido. From there, you can either take a jeepney or ask Sanctuaria to organize a van to bring you to town. It costs 2000 pesos but I was able to split it with three others going my way so it worked out well (and we split a boat later too!) After that I stayed at Sophia’s Garden in Coron town for 2 nights, which is a nice resort but I’m not sure it’s worth the money. If you’d like something more mid range, check out The Funny Lion. That’s where the girls I split the boat with stayed and it seemed they liked it. I hope this post gives you the insider info you need to have an amazing Coron island hopping experience. The shape of the islands and that beautiful blue water were a sight I won’t forget anytime soon. Want to know more about the Philippines? I’ve been all over!

Most of the time I take them myself or ask someone to help me. I wasn’t solo for this trip though and didn’t claim to be anywhere in this post. https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-take-best-travel-selfies/ Thank you so much for all the information! Everything I’ve been searching for in one post. I am going in a couple weeks with my boyfriend so we will be splitting the cost of a private boat to take us to these destinations (ones closer to Coron). I was wondering how many hours you have the boat rental for when you pay the PHP 2700 – If we were to start our rental at 7am as you suggested? It’s pretty much all day. You’ll probably be coming back around 4 or so. Wow love the post Kristin! It’s very informative.  Thanks for sharing your Coron Island trip in one of your blog!  I am a filipino. We’ve een there last 2017 with my daughter and my husband. I enjoyed the Island Hopping tour A that they offer. Lucky for you, you got to try it all out (tours A, B and C). Time was not on our side. Need to be back to our hometown because my husband got to work. But I am hoping that someday we can go back to Coron. Yes and if you do you can pick and choose the places you want to go if you get your own boat 🙂 Hi! I am Orsi, from Hungary. We will go to Coron and El Nido with my husband after Christmas, in the very beginning of January.After reading your blog, we decided trying to get private boats for island hopping. Thanks for the infos.  Due to it will be high season and we’ll have limited time at both places, it would be better if I could book those private tours in advance. But how can I find them?  Do you have any contacts (whatsapp) or sites, or other suggestions how could I do it and with whom?I just really would like to avoid missing them, or something.  #contorollfreaktraveller 🙂  Thanks for your tips in advance:) Best,Orsi Hey Orsi, you can book ahead but it usually costs more online. You can also ask your accommodation to set it up for you, if you already know where you’ll be staying. It may cost more during high season than when I went, as well. You’re blog is so helpful. Thank you for all the tips! I’ll be visiting Coron in Feb 2020! Looking forward to see the place! yay enjoy! Hi, I’ve been inhaling your blogs, thank you. Am also going to Coron in February, followed by a liveaboard, and am wondering how to do money. I will need several hundred USD in PHP for the dive boat, in addition to probably laying out a fair amount of cash for lodging, meals, and trips in Coron. I hear I should not depend on ATMs there. But hauling around a bunch of cash? Suggestions? Thanks! Coron is probably fine in terms of ATMs. I used one there and had no problems. Some of the smaller islands can be really tough because none of the ATMs will take foreign cards but that’s not usually a problem in Coron.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/twin-lagoon-coron-palawan/,Everything to Know about Coron’s Twin Lagoon,Philippines,"As I stared out from that wooden dock at the multi-hued turquoise water in front of me, I could understand why I’d heard so much about the Twin Lagoon in Coron, Palawan. It’s one of the most famous places in the Philippines and when you see it for yourself, you understand why. “Three days it took me to get here,“ said a starry-eyed girl from Morocco as she surveyed the view before us, “It was worth it,” she sighed contentedly. I felt the same way. Despite the crowds and the jellyfish, which I’ll get into later, I was still pleased to play Ariel in this watery kingdom for a few hours. The Twin Lagoon is what it sounds like – a pair of dazzling blue lagoons set amongst a backdrop of vertical, black, jagged karst walls on Coron Island. It’s one of the main things that people hope to see when they visit Coron and naturally, I wanted to see it too. I learned a lot about what to do and what not to do, so here’s the tea: The only way to get to the Twin Lagoon is to take a boat. If you have a look at the menu of island hopping excursions posted all around Coron town, you’ll be able to pick an option that includes this stop. Most group tours run from 1200-1700 pesos depending on the stops. What I recommend and what I did was to take my own boat, shared with a few others from my guesthouse, which ultimately worked out cheaper and gave us more flexibility. I was able to spend as much time as I wanted swimming through the lagoon rather than being beholden to the tour schedule or holding a big group of other people up. Most private tours can be organized through your accommodation for just the boat alone, and usually cost around 3000 pesos. If you want food or snorkeling gear, that’s extra, as is every stop you make while on the boat. However I found that by going directly to the source at the Calamian dock, I was able to pay just 2700 pesos for the boat. This is the cheapest way to do it if you’re willing to put in just a little bit of extra effort. Typically a tricycle ride to get to the port will cost about 25 pesos per passenger, so although the savings isn’t huge, it’s still well worth your effort to go independently. The Twin Lagoon is an extra 200 pesos per person on top of that. When we talk about when to go, there are two things to consider: time of day and time of year. Let’s talk about time of day first. The Twin Lagoon is one of the most popular stops in Coron, and it’s difficult to get it all to yourself. That said, you could try to be the first boat there in the morning by heading out earlier than everyone else. To do this, I would negotiate directly at the port the day before and secure your ticket ahead of time, as the Twin Lagoon and a couple of other stops, like Kayangan Lake, require tickets for entry, or you can ask your accommodation to help you set it all up. If you can get there by 7 AM, you should be able to get it more or less to yourself. When I went around two in the afternoon, it was absolutely full of people. I would have loved to see it without the crowds, however even if you can’t get there early and get it all to yourself, it’s beautiful and you can still enjoy it with others around. Sharing the experience didn’t ruin it for me like it did at Kayangan Lake, which is the other most popular stop in Coron and a much smaller area. Next let’s talk about time of year. For the most part, anytime is good to go but keep in mind that in the months just before the rainy season, which are April and May, there are more jellyfish in the water than usual. I, unfortunately, wasn’t aware of this when planning out my trip to Coron. The Twin Lagoon was full of, seriously, thousands of tiny jellyfish. I don’t actually think that everybody reacts to them, because out of everyone in my group, I was the only one who came out full of blotches. Strangely, I never felt them sting me, either. But I was suffering from suddenly painful and itchy stings that night, almost like a rash. Add that to the giant jellyfish I accidentally got into a tangle with in Romblon and I was literally covered from neck to toes. Would I do it again? Hell yeah! But I would probably bring a rash guard with the benefit of hindsight. One thing that I found a bit frustrating and unfortunate about the major tourist sites in Palawan is the life jacket requirement. Even though there are no waves in the Twin Lagoon and it’s easy to swim through, everyone is required to wear a life jacket, or at least have one in their possession. I’m not used to this, so it inhibits my ability to swim. Truth be told, I swam in partway and then tossed my life jacket onto a rock and then continued onward. I ran into a similar issue with the Big Lagoon in El Nido and observed the rule by bringing in the life jacket but sort of skirted the fine print by fastening it to a buoy and doing most of my swimming without it. Normally I think it’s important to follow the rules but this one has nothing to do with protecting nature and is more about keeping people afloat who, unlike me, aren’t strong swimmers. Thankfully there’s nobody around to enforce the rule anyways. The other thing to keep in mind is that the area is more than the first body of water you come to. You will see a lifeguard station straight ahead which you can swim under to get to the second part of the lagoon. If you continue past the buoys, you can get to a dock which has some awesome photo opportunities and fewer people around as well. I think technically this isn’t the Twin Lagoon anymore, but I highly recommend checking it out. After we finished at the Twin Lagoon, I asked my guide if we could relocate to the dock pictured above, which he said was privately owned and would require another entrance fee. However it seems to me that you could just stop there instead of the normal Twin Lagoon entry area, and get a slightly more secluded experience. It might be worth a try, if you want to show your guide the photo above. Overall, I can see why Twin Lagoon is so popular. It’s lovely to swing through, probably especially when there aren’t jellyfish blooms, and it’s hard to imagine anywhere in the world that looks quite like it. Though I wish I had seen it in the early morning hours without people, I’m still glad I saw it, crowds and all. If you’re island hopping in Coron, definitely stop by and give it at least an hour of your time. Be sure to bring your (waterproof) camera, the pictures are amazing.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-palawan-things-to-do/,"El Nido, Palawan Things to Do",Philippines,"Often referred to as the gem of the Philippines, El Nido’s reputation is thoroughly justified by its alluring scenery. From dramatic rock formations surrounded by sparkling turquoise water to hidden lagoons, incredible beaches, and a local market – El Nido is a summer chaser’s dream! The list of things to do in El Nido is extensive and can even be a little intimidating, so hopefully this guide will help you determine where to focus your time as you explore this epic tropical paradise! One of the most popular things to do in El Nido is island hopping – and for good reason! Because El Nido is comprised of 45 islands and islets, it’s no surprise that a great way to get the most out of your trip is jumping on a boat and exploring all that the sea and land has to offer. Most travelers agree that a trip to El Nido isn’t complete without at least one island hopping experience. Due to the popularity of this activity, it’s become increasingly easier to find and book tours – and the options are very accessible and straightforward. The tours are named alphabetically as A, B, C, and D. Each and every tour will give you the opportunity to explore stunning lagoons, private beaches, vibrant sea life, and the magical essence of El Nido! For detailed information on the cost, destinations, and booking for each individual tour, check out my post all about El Nido island hopping. For an adventurous and independent way to visit stunning beaches and avoid crowds, rent a kayak! Since the beauty of El Nido is in the beaches, renting a kayak is a great opportunity to find some off the beaten path beaches that the tours don’t always visit – all while getting a good workout in. That said, you can hit up 7 Commandos Beach, a Tour A stop, in the evening to get an off-peak experience. You can rent a kayak in El Nido town, but the paddling will be much longer than if you rent a kayak in Corong Corong Beach, about 10 minutes from the town of El Nido. Get there by flagging down a tricycle or hopping on a scooter! There are options for regular kayaks priced at 500 PHP for a full day or 300 PHP for half the day – if you want to splurge, you can even rent a clear kayak to see the amazing water beneath you… and sea life if you’re lucky! You’ll find kayaks for rent all along the beach if you just take a walk. Check out this great guide for an extensive list of beaches that can be accessed independently and how to get to each of them.  El Nido is home to approximately 30 dive sites and you can count on frequent trips to at least 10 of them depending on tides and conditions. Bacuit Bay is a mecca for exquisite sea life and mind blowing natural structural formations. The bay is also protected from the ocean’s strong currents – so scuba diving in El Nido is accessible to divers of all experience levels. If you’re interested in freediving, you can also learn how in El Nido. Check out Freediving Dimension and for a review of my experience learning how to do it in Indonesia, you can read more here. A fun and tasty way to get a glimpse into authentic local culture pretty much anywhere you visit is to walk through the town’s public market. With a daily market (starting at 5:30am), El Nido is no exception! Stop by the public market before starting the day’s adventure for some fresh fruit or veggies, or rehydrate after a long day at the beach with a fresh Filipino coconut. As always, remember that other countries probably have different sanitation standards than your own. To be extra safe, consider opting for fruits or vegetables that are uncut that you can peel or wash with sterilized water to reduce the risk of coming face to face with harmful bacteria. To be honest, though, I almost never follow this rule and after 6 years of traveling, even after eating raw veggies and street food the whole time, I’ve never had food poisoning. Las Cabanas is one of El Nido’s most beautiful and popular beaches. No boat? No problem. Las Cabanas can be reached by a 100-150 peso tricycle from El Nido town, which is a major bonus for those who value the ability to do and see certain places independently. Being a bit more developed than El Nido’s other beaches, Las Cabanas makes for a perfect day trip where visitors can sunbathe, enjoy a swim, sip on a fresh coconut, or try local food and drinks at one of the many intimate beach bars. This is also one of the best places in El Nido to enjoy the sunset over the ocean due to the nearly perfect orientation of the beach. I recommend heading up to The Nesting Table at The Birdhouse (also a nice place to stay) for dinner, which is a hotel, yoga studio, and restaurant with the view pictured above. It’s perfect for sunset. Look for the stairs right after the zipline from the beach. Just a note on entry – when I was there the guard asked if I had reservations, which I didn’t. I asked if I could just go up to take a look and it turned out that most of the restaurant was empty and they were happy to have me. So in case you run into the same problem, try asking if you can go up just to check it out! At 230 meters above sea level, Taraw Peak is the highest point overlooking El Nido town, the bay, and nearby beaches. The hike to the top is apparently super steep and sketchy at times, but it provides panoramic views of Bacuit Bay, amazing landscapes, and limestone paths. This strenuous 2 hour hike is best done at sunrise to avoid the intense heat that builds up the more times you hit snooze. It’s highly recommended to hire a professional guide and wear proper shoes for this one, as it is a challenging and physically exhausting trek – making the one of a kind view from the top even more rewarding. As of 2019, tours are no longer available to hike to the top due to a couple of tourist deaths last year. That said, new reviews are still popping up on Google Maps all the time, so I suspect that if you ask around town, you can still find a local who will take you up there, provided you’re clear on the dangers and want to take the risk. Alternatively, there’s a canopy walk that gives you a nice, though not as epic, view from the top with more ease and safety. It costs 400 pesos per person and a helmet is required. Nacpan Beach is known as one of the most stunning beaches that El Nido has to offer. The quintessential postcard image, Nacpan is not only a beach and sunset lover’s dream but a photographer’s dream, fisherman’s dream, I think you get the point… Nacpan Beach is straight up dreamy! Close your eyes and picture paradise and this beach might just be what you see. There is even a small wave that is surfable some days! Nacpan is one half of the ‘Twin Beaches’ (Calitang being the other), so you can easily enjoy both glorious places in one trip. If you’re comfortable on a scooter, this is easy to combine with the Nagkalit-kalit Waterfalls for a day trip. If not, you can get a tricycle from El Nido town for about 1500 pesos roundtrip. Pricey, but when shared, it’s still cheaper than an island hopping trip. There’s really nothing that compares to the freedom you get by riding the roads of villages, hills, and forests on a motorbike. With all that El Nido has to offer, renting a scooter is really the best way to fit it all in without having to book tours and rides every step of the way. Scootering around is such an adventure in and of itself, plus, the costs of tricycles can add up pretty quickly while a motorbike will only cost you about 500 PHP per day. Just don’t forget your helmet! On the route from El Nido proper to Nacpan you’ll find a quick and beautiful half hour hike to two waterfalls, a big one and a small one. Stops like this are a great example of why El Nido is the perfect place to rent a motorbike – so that you can stop wherever you want to and experience as much as possible. This is also a great opportunity to get a little hiking in if Taraw Peak is a strict no while you’re there. Plus, there is a natural pool to swim in at the bottom of one of the falls! The reviews of the falls are mixed, with some calling it unimpressive, and apparently you have to pay 250 pesos for a ‘guide’. If you’ve enjoyed the waterfalls of Siquijor it might not be worth the trek but if you’re dying for something different and out of the sun, it’s an option. I stayed on the slightly quieter Corong Corong Beach and loved that I could walk down to see the sunset each night. The way that the water receded to show sandbars in the evenings was perfect (though that entirely depends on the moon phases, of course!). I highly recommend staying at El Nido Overlooking and booking your island hopping tours through them while you’re there. It’s a 4-villa resort with beautiful decks, one with a private pool, and some quiet and solitude that you can’t get from most other places in El Nido. Flocks of travelers combined with loads of restaurants and the glittering sea gives El Nido town its charm. Some say it’s overwhelmingly busy but regardless of how you feel about it, El Nido is definitely full of life. Narrow dusty streets welcome dogs and cats alongside plenty of tricycles and scooters. The chaos that seems to take over even the smallest of Southeast Asian towns can be quite hectic and you may find yourself thinking “wasn’t I just here?” every time you turn down a new street. If you’re not sure which way to go and every street prior looked the exact same, Serena Street will feel like a little breath of fresh air. Lined with fine restaurants, high quality local shops, and even decent WiFi here and there, Serena Street is one you’ll finally be able to distinguish from the others. As I said at the beginning of this post, there are TONS of things to do and places to see in El Nido, each providing a different vantage point of the gorgeous horizon, dotted with candy shaped mounds of islands. While the town itself isn’t as idyllic as some of the smaller spots in the Philippines, El Nido makes up for it with its gorgeous beaches and variety. Hey Kristin,Always love reading your blogs when they pop up in my email and then just got the lovely surprise that you linked to our kayaking beach guide! Thanks so much. Cat x For sure!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-tour-b/,El Nido Tour B: Is It Worth It?,Philippines,"If you landed here you must already know about El Nido’s gorgeous islands, forming a fringe of adventures ringing around the town, ripe for day trips. El Nido’s popular island hopping excursions are organized through a popular series of tours that have fixed routes, named A through D. During my time in El Nido, I wanted to experience the more popular side of it, yet attempt to get away from the crowds, if and when possible. El Nido’s Tour B isn’t quite as popular as A or C, which precisely makes it so great. Here’s what to expect if you do Tour B, both as a private or organized island hopping tour: Though parts of this beach have been privatized by a resort, you can still enjoy a small cove of white sand with a free-standing diamond shaped rock. There’s also great snorkeling here, particularly the farther out you go. Just make sure you’re keeping an eye on your distance from the shore and current strength. Typically the lunch stop on this tour, Snake Island is named for the long sandbar that stretches from the island clear across to another. Though these shots are with a drone, you can hike up to the top of Snake Island and get a pretty good vantage point of the crystal clear water. As a sandbar enthusiast, this stop is what made me want to do Tour B. I wasn’t disappointed! Even at high tide, this one is gorgeous. Tour B is known as the ‘cave’ tour since it includes this cave and the next one on the list. It’s not a tight, enclosed caving experience but rather an open, well-lit cave that isn’t particularly big. If you’ve been to Black Island in Coron this one doesn’t boast that awesome swimming hole, but it’s still cool to check out the inside of these limestone cliffs and get a different point of view of El Nido’s islands. There’s also a nice beach on this island worth spending some time enjoying. This is a short stop just to look up into the cavern-like cave formed in the cliffside of one of the islands. The only way to visit it is by boat, though most of the tour boats are too big to venture very far inside. We spent about 5 minutes here – just long enough for a few photos while our guides struggled to hold onto the ropes on the cave’s walls to keep the boat from hitting the rock. I’m unsure if they can anchor and let you swim inside, but it could be worth asking if you book a private tour what the options are. I loved the unique shape of this island, and the fact that when we went in the morning, there wasn’t anybody else there. Most tours end here, but if you do a private tour and go in reverse, it’s possible to head here first and get it all to yourself, as I did. The current was strong when I was there but it does have a reef you can snorkel if you have better conditions. It’s worth noting that overall, this is less of a snorkeling tour and more of a cave/sandbar tour than Tours A and C. These days all tour prices are fixed in El Nido for group tours, with Tour B priced at 1300 pesos per person. There’s also a 200 PHP environmental fee required for doing any island hopping tour in El Nido, which is good for 10 days. If you’ve already paid it for another tour, you’re good to go. I also did Tour B as a private tour after a crowded Tour A the previous day in hopes of having a more secluded experience (more on that later). I paid 5000 PHP, without lunch, for the tour. You may read reviews online or on message boards discussing prices and the possibility of negotiating directly with boat owners. However after asking at about 15 places in town it’s clear to me that prices have doubled from just 2 years ago for private tours, and you won’t be finding them in the 3k or 4k range anymore. The best way to save money is to bring your own lunch, which cuts out 1500 pesos of the tour fee. That’s how I got the private boat for 5k. I booked at my accommodation, El Nido Overlooking, which had the cheapest price out of everywhere I looked. The rooms are great there too with an amazing view! Since everyone seems to make calls to agencies rather than owning their own boats (unless you’re staying at a hotel that has its own), it doesn’t really matter who you book with. I found that Klook actually has lower prices and great reviews, so if I had done a group tour, I would have gone that route. You can book Tour B here. I’m sorry to say that I didn’t have the absolute best experience with guides in El Nido. Since you’re required to have one, it wasn’t as simple as rocking up to the shore and negotiating directly with a boat owner and going where we pleased, like I could do in Romblon. In my review of Tour A, you’ll notice the guide tried to cut out two stops, and despite my best efforts to connect and be friendly, he just didn’t seem like he wanted to be there. I get it, everyone is going through their own stuff, but it was my worst experience with boat guides and captains in the Philippines to date. That said, you never know what you’re going to get since who you book with probably doesn’t own the boats and by the time you’re face to face with the guide, you’re probably 2-3 people removed from who you originally booked with. This presented some issues like what was and wasn’t included, such as snorkeling gear and transport, but overall I would still do the private tour since it gave me much more solitude, and allowed me to have some time at the caves, beaches, and islands to myself. That’s just not possible on a group tour. For me, it boils down to what you can afford. Tour B is less crowded in general, so doing the itinerary in reverse from what the tour boats do could afford you some alone time in an otherwise very touristy El Nido. It just depends on how many people you’re splitting with and if the extra cost is worth it to you! You can also customize the stops a bit more, if you’d like to switch out some things for others from different tours. Most group tours will include lunch and water, though you may want to double check that they will have water for you to refill your bottles with. In theory El Nido is trying to cut down on single use plastic, but not every tour provides water. You’ll also want to bring along snorkeling gear, which you can rent for 150 pesos for a mask and snorkel and 150 for a set of fins. I brought my own mask from home and would suggest you do the same. You can be more sure of the quality and won’t have to pay the equivalent of 3 US dollars every single day that you go island hopping. I didn’t use fins during my El Nido experience and didn’t really feel they were necessary, but I would base your decision on that on how strong of a swimmer you are without them. There are plenty of places in town where you can rent, or most of the tour operators will have gear as well. It can also be a good idea to bring along a dry bag (I use this one) if you want to be able to take photos, especially if kayaking in the lagoons. All of these photos were shot with a GoPro HERO7 Black, and my DJI Mavic 2 Pro. You can read more about my camera gear here. Also be sure to bring along sunscreen, as you’ll have your back to the sun often on this trip. It’s also helpful to bring along your own beach towel. Overall, Tour B was a less crowded, more secluded experience than Tour A, with beaches and islands that were just as amazing, if not more so. That said, I’d still spend another day in El Nido on either Tour A or C, or both, for a chance to do more snorkeling and to see the Big Lagoon. Hello me and my husband are going to el nido in march and we have 3 full days thinking of doing tour A,B&C. One of them being private on the first day as its my 30TH! Which would you recommend doing private? We originally thought A as its most popular but does that mean it will still be really busy going private so not worth it. Thanks x B in the reverse was good as a private tour!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/el-nido-tour-a/,El Nido Tour A: How to Do it Right,Philippines,"El Nido’s cluster of gumdrop-shaped islands, famous for their dramatic limestone cliffs and white sand beaches, truly is as incredible in person as it appears in photos. The best way to enjoy El Nido is to hop around these islands, armed with a mask and snorkel, and sunscreen, of course! Tours in El Nido are organized with set stops and labeled A through D. Tour A is the most popular in El Nido, thanks to the Big and Small Lagoons. Given this, there are some things you should know before diving in (pun intended!). Written in 2019, this is the most up-to-date resource on the Internet for El Nido island hopping Tour A: It used to be that Tour A stopped at both the Big and Small Lagoons. However recent legislation, in an effort to curb the amount of people who visit each day, dictates that visitors may now only visit one or the other in the span of a day. You’ll want to make sure that your tour operator has one of these permits available for you before booking. I got to experience the Big Lagoon and thought it was perfect. I’ve been told that both are amazing, so I suggest going for whichever is available. It’s difficult to get the lagoons to yourself, but the Big Lagoon is big enough that it doesn’t feel crowded, particularly the farther in you go. Everyone I saw at the Big Lagoon rented a kayak for 250 pesos. But I love to swim, so I opted to swim through the Big Lagoon instead and it was the highlight of my whole El Nido experience! If you love to swim as much as I do, bring along a mask and snorkel and go for it. Just be extra careful to avoid stonefish and sea urchins. I advise never standing up past the sandy entrance so only do this if you won’t need regular rests. Keep in mind that you must wear a lifejacket when in the Big Lagoon, whether you’re swimming or kayaking. However there is no current and zero waves, so I clipped the lifejacket to a buoy and had most of my Big Lagoon experience without one. To me it’s a silly rule and I completely detest lifejackets, but do keep in mind that the lagoon truly is big and if you think you’ll get tired, you can bring it along as a sort of kickboard. Hidden Lagoon isn’t so hidden anymore, but this circular, almost completely sealed off pool is only accessible through a tiny hole in the side of the limestone and it’s so cool! I got lucky and had a full few minutes in the lagoon all to myself. There are often queues to get in, but you can always hang out on the beach nearby or near the rock formations a few yards out until it clears up. There’s a lot of snorkeling involved on Tour A, including a spot devoted just to snorkeling. The corals are lovely, and a highlight for me was the school of tiny glittering blue fish swimming around. The benefit of snorkeling in El Nido is the super clear water. Chances are good that your tour will do the snorkeling portion earlier in the day before there’s much wind and current, so it makes for an easy, enjoyable experience. An impressive limestone island with a small white sand beach, this is usually the lunch spot for organized Tour A groups. There is also some snorkeling around here, but be careful not to get swept down the channel between Shimizu and its neighboring island. It’s not a crazy strong current, at least not when I was there, but things can change with the seasons. Unlike Shimizu island, this beach has a bigger, longer stretch of white sand along with palm trees, a little basketball court in the sand, and beach huts. This is where most tours finish up as it’s the closest to El Nido town. You can also access this beach with a kayak later on if you love it enough to come back! Organized tours provide more or less the same spread of rice, grilled fish and chicken, fresh fruit, and salad. It’s a pretty good offering but tends to cost 1500 pesos extra if you’re doing the tour on your own as a private tour. In this case, I’d recommend bringing your own food. The costs for all group tours are fixed now in El Nido with Tour A priced at 1200 pesos per person. I read online previously that the prices would differ depending on quality but this is no longer true. The only place I found the price a bit cheaper was through booking on Klook. The ratings are pretty good, so if I had done a group tour I would probably have done that. Tour A also has a 200 pesos environmental fee per person, which is good for any other tour for 10 days, and an additional 200 for either the Big or Small Lagoon. You’ll also want to bring some extra cash in case you want to buy a coconut or rent a kayak. As for the private tours, you can expect quite a big range. Pretty much everyone in town can sell you one, from tour operators to hotels to even the tricycle drivers. I asked about 15 different places about their pricing and the cheapest ended up being at my hotel, El Nido Overlooking. Their tour is priced at 6000 pesos, which is 1000 lower than anywhere else I checked. Again, since almost everyone just goes through the same agencies and books random boats, I don’t know that quality control varies if you pay more. It’s also possible that the boats will quote a higher price. That happened to me with Tour A but not with Tour B. So I ended up needing to pay 6000, but without food. If you cut out food from the trip, you can save 1500 pesos. It’s highly unlikely that you would spend more than that if you get food on your own, so I’d suggest doing what I did and getting extra food the night before and storing it in your room fridge (El Nido Overlooking has them in their rooms). I brought along the Mexican beans and rice bowl from Taste El Nido and it was perfect. Is it better to do Tour A with a group in order to cut down on costs, or is it better to do a private tour? Year over year, the cost of a private tour in El Nido has been compounding. Even just two years ago, it was about half the price that it is these days. I found a few companies online that had too-low-to-be-true prices, and when I contacted them to verify, they told me that they had actually doubled. So if you’re doing a private tour in El Nido you can expect to be quoted anywhere from 7000 pesos on the low-end to 9000 on the high-end….. almost $175 USD! Is it worth it to do a private tour? This totally depends on how much flexibility and freedom you want to change up certain items in the itinerary (or even try to leave earlier or do some of it in reverse order), AND how many people you’re sharing the boat with. On one hand I liked doing the tours as private tours because it meant no waiting around in the morning, unlike group tours where sometimes you can wait up to two hours, and being able to enjoy each place for as long as I wanted. I was sometimes able to get things to myself this way, like the Hidden Lagoon. The downside is whoever you book this with, whether it is a hotel or agency, chances are good the right hand isn’t really talking to the left. I was pretty disappointed that the guide on my boat tried to cut out two of the stops on my Tour A, rationalizing it by saying that Shimizu Island was the “lunch stop” but since we had brought our own lunch, he could cut that stop off. I also did a private Tour B, which I was able to customize a bit more, but overall my experience with both guides in El Nido was not that positive, especially when compared to Coron and Romblon. Maybe it’s because the guys make a good commission off of the included lunch and were mad we’d gone the cheaper route, or they just figured we didn’t know which stops should be included, but this was a bit frustrating and disappointing, particularly since this is the most expensive island hopping in El Nido that I’m aware of. I only mention this because if you’re on a private tour, it’s a bit easier for a stop to get cut off or missed and you’re probably not getting the best crew and boats, so just make sure that you’re getting what you paid for and asked for. I’m not aware of a possibility of just showing up at the boat docks like one can do in Coron. It seems in El Nido finding a boat that isn’t hired out by someone is harder to do these days, but just because I didn’t manage to do it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. If you do manage to do this, please let me know in the comments below! Overall, I’d still opt to do private tours because that’s just my preference, even when it costs more. However if it’s not in your budget, the group tours take you to all the same places and on a tour as popular as Tour A, you’ll be sharing it with others no matter what anyway. Most group tours will include lunch and water, though you may want to double check that they will have water for you to refill your bottles with. In theory El Nido is trying to cut down on single use plastic, but not every tour provides water. You’ll also want to bring along snorkeling gear, which you can rent for 150 pesos for a mask and snorkel and 150 for a set of fins. I brought my own mask from home and would suggest you do the same. You can be more sure of the quality and won’t have to pay the equivalent of 3 US dollars every single day that you go island hopping. I didn’t use fins during my El Nido experience and didn’t really feel they were necessary, but I would base your decision on that on how strong of a swimmer you are without them. There are plenty of places in town where you can rent, or most of the tour operators will have gear as well. It can also be a good idea to bring along a dry bag (I use this one) if you want to be able to take photos, especially if kayaking in the lagoons. All of these photos were shot with a GoPro HERO7 Black, and my DJI Mavic 2 Pro. You can read more about my camera gear here. Also be sure to bring along sunscreen, as you’ll have your back to the sun often on this trip. It’s also helpful to bring along your own beach towel. Overall, El Nido Tour A gives you a glimpse into some truly beautiful and unique beaches, snorkeling spots, and rock formations that you can’t see anywhere else in the world. It is popular, so plan on sharing it with others. However despite that, the Big Lagoon was still the highlight of my time in El Nido. So bring some extra patience, definitely bring your camera, and enjoy the ride! Thanks for this article. I’ve recently returned from El Nido and all I’m thinking is I wish I had read this before going. 🙂  I tried a private tour in Coron and was so put off by the level of disorganization, I thought a group tour can’t be much worse, so for Tour A in El Nido I booked a group one via my hotel.  It was only once on the guide told us we would not be going to the big lagoon and instead would be doing the small lagoon, which tbh I didn’t think was all that. He tried to say that it was down to the hotel to secure the permit, but if i’ve understood it right it’s the tour company. Regardless I was peed off I was not made aware of this when booking. We then had lunch on the boat (a great lunch btw) at the secret lagoon, and as in your article they used that as an excuse not to go to Shimizu island. Finally instead of 7 Commando’s beach we went to Papaya beach which is ok, but doesn’t look nearly as nice as 7 Commando’s beach. I’ll be going back to Palawan at the end of this year and will try this again. So do tour agencies know at the time of booking if they will have a permit to visit the big lagoon? It feels like miselling a bit to take the tourists money and change up the itinerary on the day. Yes they should have the permit at the time of booking and should let you know. We had to go on a specific day to have the big lagoon permit and yes it does come down to the company. That’s so lame that they did that on your trip. I don’t understand trying to swindle the people who provide your livelihood. Hello!  thanks for this it’s very helpful indeed. I,’ll be going to el nido next week. I booked tour A via the link you have provided, Hope everything will turn out okey not like what had happened to the first commenter. Great! The reviews from the Klook tour are great, so it should be consistent.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/singapore-itinerary/,A Local’s Guide to Singapore,Singapore,"The following post is by Hui Jun Ng: Singapore might just be a tiny red dot on the globe, but the Southeast Asian country is filled with world-class architecture, delicious food, and fun things to do that don’t have to empty your wallet. There is much more to Singapore’s glitzy accolades than meets the eye, and I sincerely hope you have a wonderful time exploring the nation that I call home: 10am: Breakfast at one-Michelin-star Tai Hwa Pork Noodle Tai Hwa Pork Noodle has been a perennial favourite amongst Singaporeans since the 1930s. The one-Michelin-starred noodle store serves the best bak chor mee (bowls start from S$5 each) dish aka egg noodles served with minced pork. These delicious cooked-to-order noodles are characterized by a distinct complex sauce, which consists of sambal chilli, black vinegar and other secret ingredients. Word of the no-frills local eatery has gone viral ever since it was awarded a glorious Michelin star and nowadays, it is common to queue up to two hours. Just two months ago, Tai Hwa Pork Noodle emerged as #1 in this year’s Top 50 World Street Food Masters list. This means the queue could possibly get longer. To make your time worthwhile, order the bigger bowl of bak chor mee instead. Address: 466 Crawford Lane, #01-12, Singapore 190465 Nearest MRT: Lavender (a 10-minute walk) 11am: Explore the vibrant Kampong Glam neighbourhood Haji Lane is a quaint stretch of road lined with fashion boutiques, hipster cafes and hole-in-the-wall watering holes. The walls on both ends of the street are strewn with gorgeous graffiti art so do bring along your camera as there are heaps of photography opportunities for your next Instagram update. Once you are done exploring Haji Lane, do walk over to the nearby majestic Masjid Sultan. Address: Haji Lane Nearest MRT: Bugis Station (a 6-minute walk) 1pm: Chicken Rice at 83-year-old Chin Chin Eating House Ask any tourist where they are going to eat chicken rice at and they will tell you “Tian Tian”. Unfortunately, I personally do not think that Tian Tian is worth the hype. For those not in the know, Tian Tian Chicken Rice’s chef actually left Tian Tian a few years ago and has set up a store next door called Ah Tai Chicken Rice. Tian Tian and Ah Tai aside, there is an old-school chicken rice specialty eatery that I absolutely adore. Called Chin Chin Eating House, the restaurant has been around since 1934 and the Hainanese chicken served here is consistently juicy and tender. You can choose from either Steamed Chicken or Roasted Chicken. Address: 19 Purvis Street, Singapore 188598 Nearest MRT: Bugis (a 8-minute walk) 2pm: Shop at Singapore’s biggest marketplace, Bugis Street Bugis Street Market is Singapore’s biggest marketplace; from trendy dresses, phone accessories, local snacks, souvenir postcards to even branded knockoffs, you can seriously find every item thinkable here at the cheapest prices. Visitors can too get haircuts and manicure sessions at very competitive prices. P.s. The sprawling market is filled with nooks and crannies and is easy to get lost. Address: 3 New Bugis Street, Singapore 188867 Nearest MRT: Bugis (a 2-minute walk) 4pm: Visit the Art Science Museum Spanning across 50,000 square feet and featuring 21 gallery spaces, the Art Science Museum has hosted many extraordinary exhibitions to date. The modern infrastructure bears an uncanny resemblance to an open lotus flower and can be easily identified from afar. The museum has successfully integrated art and technology into an interactive space – it is suitable for visitors of all ages! Its permanent exhibition Future World boasts jaw-dropping cutting-edge digital installations. Do not miss out on the Crystal Universe – a spellbindingly beautiful display which features more than 170,000 LED lights. Visitors are encouraged to purchase tickets online (to avoid the crowd) and plan their trip way in advance. Tickets start from S$17 per adult and the last entry to the museum is at 5.30pm. Address: 6 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018974 Nearest MRT: Bayfront Station (a 10-minute walk) 6pm: Dinner at the award-winning Long Chim Restaurant  Long Chim by Chef David Thompson at Marina Bay Sands might be a celebrity restaurant, but prices are kept affordable despite its fame and prime location. Their scrumptious plate of Stir-fried Minced Pork With Basil, Egg and Rice (S$26++) is one of my personal favourite, but might be too spicy for some. Drop by before 8pm and enjoy their happy hour promotion where selected signature cocktails such as Thaisteenie and 555 are sold at only S$10++ each. Address: 10 Bayfront Avenue, #02-02, Atrium 2 The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018955 Nearest MRT: Bayfront Station (a 2-minute walk) 9pm: Drinks at CÉ LA VI and enjoy unrivalled views of Singapore CÉ LA VI is a restaurant-cum-bar perched atop Marina Bay Sands Tower 3. Visitors would usually have to pay an entrance fee to access the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck located at level 57. But our insider tip is: DO NOT PAY FOR IT.  In fact, ladies should visit CÉ LA VI on a Wednesday night to enjoy free entrance to the nightclub and one complimentary house pour. The scintillating view of Singapore’s skyline from CÉ LA VI will blow you away. Have your GoPro ready! Address: 1 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018971 Nearest MRT: Bayfront Station (a 9-minute walk) 10am: Grab a Singaporean-style breakfast at Yakun Kaya Toast  Yakun Kaya Toast is a household name in Singapore. The family-run business has become so popular that there are currently 56 Yakun outlets across the sunny island. However, do make a special trip to its flagship store at Far East Square – where the founder’s descendants today manage the store. For the uninitiated, the Malaysian word ‘kaya’ actually refers to the fragrant coconut jam. For the quintessential Singaporean experience, order the Kaya Butter Toast Set (S$4.80). It comprises four traditional Kaya Toasts with butter, soft-boiled eggs and a cup of hot coffee or milk tea. Each decadent thin brown toast – stuffed with generous amounts of kaya spread and thick butter slab – is toasted till crisp. The soft-boiled eggs are best eaten with sparing amounts of soy sauce and pepper. Address: 18 China Street, #01-01, Far East Square, Singapore 049560 Nearest MRT: Telok Ayer Station (a 3-minute walk) 11am: Explore ethnic enclave Chinatown Ethnic enclave Chinatown is one of Singapore’s most photogenic destinations. Once upon a time, the Chinatown precinct was an overcrowded dingy district that housed Chinese immigrants. Several famous streets constitute Chinatown, namely Temple Street, Smith Street, Pagoda Street and Trengganu Street. Check out the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, educate yourselves with Singapore’s history at Chinatown Heritage Centre, sample local delicacies at Smith Street’s open-air food street, visit Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple Sri Mariamman and shop for souvenirs at the bustling Trengganu Street. Nearest MRT: Chinatown 2pm: Eat Nasi Lemak at The Coconut Club The Coconut Club sits at the intersection of Club Street and Ann Siang Hill. Just a quick clarification: The Coconut Club is a Nasi Lemak specialty restaurant, not a nightclub! So what exactly is a Nasi Lemak? Well, it is a rice-based dish; rice is cooked in pandan leaves and fresh coconut milk, then served with dried anchovies, cucumber slices, a fried egg, succulent chicken leg and sambal chili. Even Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had lunch with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte at The Coconut Club too! A plate of this goodness costs S$12.80. Address: 6 Ann Siang Hill, Singapore 069787 Nearest MRT: Chinatown Station (a 6-minute walk) 3.30pm: Visit Singapore’s best attraction, Gardens by the Bay I have visited Gardens by the Bay countless of times ever since the first-rate attraction opened its doors to public, yet the novelty of this enchanting garden hasn’t worn off. Admission to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest will set you back at S$28 per adult, but I promise you that it will be money well spent. Do make it a point to stay at Gardens by the Bay till nighttime, as the nightly Garden Rhapsody Light and Sound Show – led by award-winning Lighting Designer Adrian Tan – commences at 7.45pm at the Supertree Grove. The spectacular performance is free for all and you must not miss it! Address: 18 Marina Gardens Drive, Singapore 018953 Nearest MRT: Bayfront (a 9-minute walk) 8.30pm: Dinner at Song Fa Bak Ku Teh  When directly translated, Bak Ku Teh literally means pork ribs soup. And nobody does this dish better than Song Fa Bak Ku The. Famous for their piping hot peppery broth and fall-off-the-bone tender pork ribs, Song Fa Bak Ku Teh actually started its business from a humble pushcart stall in 1969. Today, the brand is a well-known institution with seven outlets located in Singapore. Snaking queues are a daily occurrence at its Clarke Quay outlet. Here is an insider’s tip: If you want to skip the queue, you can visit the one at Orchard Central. The Orchard Central outlet is a lot quieter, but tastes equally good! Address: 11 New Bridge Road, #01-01, Singapore 059383 Nearest MRT: Clarke Quay Station (a 1-minute walk) 10pm: Drinks at 28 Hong Kong Street (Asia’s Best Bar 2016) 28 Hong Kong Street is the grand daddy of all speakeasy bars in Singapore. The specialty cocktail bar has been around for a half a decade and it has continuously ranked in the World’s 50 Best Bars list throughout all these years. 28 Hong Kong Street also won Asia’s best bar in 2016 – a title that most can only dream of. Getting a table might be a little tricky due to its overwhelming fame. But if you do score a seat, please do order the Old Fashioned served with a hand-cut ice cube and their heavenly Truffle Mac and Cheese Balls. Address: 28 Hongkong Street, Singapore 059667 Nearest MRT: Clarke Quay Station (a 2-minute walk) 12am: Party at Zouk, the 4th best club in the world Zouk Singapore is ranked as the 4th best club in the world – and this award is only one of the many accolades it has received. Many top DJs such as Armin van Buuren and Above & Beyond have performed at the swanky nightclub, and the nightly crowds are testimony to its popularity. While Zouk’s previous location at Jiak Kim Street will always be an irreplaceable memory amongst the older Singaporeans, its swanky new location at Clarke Quay is set to challenge new boundaries and soar to greater heights. There are a few different rooms in Zouk, namely Zouk, Capital, Phuture and Red Tail by Zouk. Address: 3C River Valley Road, #01-05, The Cannery, Singapore 179022 Nearest MRT: Clarke Quay Station (a 7-minute walk) 12pm: Savour Nyonya cuisine at National Kitchen by Violet Oon  National Kitchen by Violet Oon’s classy 1920s interiors is bound to impress. From mirrored ceilings, dark panels, elegant chandeliers to intricate tiles, no expense was spared to create this opulent restaurant. The fine dining destination can be found on the second level for the National Gallery Singapore. Look forward to traditional Peranakan dishes such as Kuay Pie Tee and Buah Keluak Ayam; the former is a classic Nyonya classic snack filled with prawns and vegetables, while the latter is a chicken stew braised with buah keluak nuts. The Buah Keluak Ayam might be too exotic for first-timers, but is still worth trying! Address: 1 St. Andrew’s Road #02–01, National Gallery, Singapore 178957 Nearest MRT: City Hfall (a 5-minute walk) 2pm: Visit the world’s biggest collection of modern Southeast Asian Art After S$532 million and 10 years of painstaking restoration efforts, the National Gallery Singapore officially opened its doors in late 2015. The gallery is a conglomeration of two national monuments, namely the former Supreme Court and City Hall. Architectural highlights include the Rotunda Dome and City Hall Chamber. The 64,000-sq-m attraction is currently home to the world’s largest collection of modern Southeast Asian Art. There are two permanent galleries held at National Gallery Singapore, but special exhibitions are also held at this museum from time to time. General admission tickets start from S$20 per adult. You can walk around the gallery for free if you do not wish to pay to check out the artwork. Address: 1 St. Andrew’s Road, Singapore 178957 Nearest MRT: City Hall (a 5-minute walk) 5pm: Drink the original Singapore Sling at Raffles Hotel While most Singaporeans do not drink the Singapore Sling on a regular basis (or at all), it is still Singapore’s national cocktail with an interesting historical story. Singapore in the Straits Settlements had a social etiquette imposed on the ladies then, whereby they were prohibited from the consumption of alcohol in public. Raffles Hotel’s bartender Ngiam Tong Boon understood the women’s frustration. In 1915, he created the first-ever Singapore Sling, which was a gin-based concoction of D.O.M. Bénédictine, cherry brandy, Cointreau, pineapple juice, lime juice and angostura bitters. That pretty cocktail was revolutionary for the ladies. While there are countless variations of the Singapore Sling found across the world today, nothing beats having the original creation at Raffles Hotel itself. Address: 1 Beach Road, Singapore 189673 Nearest MRT: Esplanade (a 2-minute walk) 7.30pm: Devour chili crabs at Tunglok Seafood  No trip to Singapore is complete until you have a taste of our divine chili crabs. The number of eateries and restaurants offering this iconic Singaporean dish is seemingly infinite, and the popular establishments such as While Long Beach, Melben Seafood and JUMBO Seafood experience insanely long queues every day. Skip the tourist crowd and dine at TungLok Seafood Restaurant instead. The homegrown brand is by TungLok Group, a reputable Singapore restaurant group. The crustacean is dunked in a thick gravy mixture – chili-based tomato sauce and freshly squeeze orange juice – and is best eaten with deep-fried man tou buns. Address: 181 Orchard Road, #11-05 Orchard Central, Singapore 238896 Nearest MRT: Somerset Station (a 6-minute walk) 9pm: Waltz down Orchard Road shopping belt Take a leisure stroll down Orchard Road and immerse yourself in the city’s bedazzling lights. Orchard Road is a premier shopping district boasting more than 30 shopping malls and department stores. Even if you are not a shopaholic, there are still aplenty fascinating sights to discover. Strike a pose at the glass sky-bridge at Orchard Gateway, make a short detour and visit the colourful shop houses of Emerald Hill, admire the futuristic architecture of ION Orchard and then head up to ION Sky Observatory to check out Singapore’s cityscape (entrance is free of charge). 10pm: Manhattan Bar at Regent (Asia’s Best Bar 2017) Manhattan Bar at Regent – which will remind you of The Great Gatsby – recently bagged the title of Asia’s Best Bar 2017. The stunning bar is also home to the world’s very first onsite rick house. Everyone is dressed to the nines and there is a smart-casual dress code to adhere; tank tops and slippers are not allowed. As its name implies, Manhattan Bar borrows its influence from 19th century New York. From decors, drinks to bar bites, everything is reminiscent of the Big Apple. For maximum satisfaction, order the Big Apple Cheesecake and New York Sour. There is really no better bar than Manhattan to end your last night in Singapore. Prices are steep, but it’s your last night so do go all out and paint the town red!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/singapore-free-things-to-do/,8 Things To Do In Singapore That Are Totally Free,Singapore,"The following post is by Hui Jun Ng: If you’ve been traveling around Southeast Asia loving how far your money takes you, you might be worried about having a good time in Singapore on a budget. Despite Singapore’s reputation as the priciest city in the world, a short vacation here can actually be relatively affordable – if you know what the best free things to do are. In this city guide, we will reveal to you the essential travel hacks when in Singapore. You can watch musical performances, eat vegetarian meals and admire Singapore’s skyline from the top of Marina Bay Sands for free, plus a bunch of other totally free activities, so keep on reading! Visiting the iconic Marina Bay Sands and heading to its Sky Park Observation Deck seems like a common activity amongst tourists, but why pay an entrance fee when you can enjoy the same – or an even better – view of Singapore’s cityscape with a complimentary alcoholic drink in your hand at Cé La Vi? Cé La Vi is perched atop Marina Bay Sands and comprises a restaurant, sky bar and nightclub. Every Wednesday night, Cé La Vi launches an exciting party called Diamond Life – where ladies are granted free entry to the club and are entitled to one premium pour. Unfortunately, gentlemen do not enjoy the same privileges. Marina Bay Sands, Tower 3, 1 Bayfront Ave, Singapore 018971 Who said you have to be loaded to catch a musical performance? Esplanade Theatres on the Bay offers a selection of free programmes throughout the year. Just scroll through the official website’s calendar and you might just score yourself a free musical held in one of the world’s most beautiful concert halls. Local dancers and musicians also often perform nightly at the Esplanade Outdoor Theatre situated just along the Marina Bay waterfront. Yes, admission is free too. 1 Esplanade Dr, Singapore 038981 Orchard Road was voted as the world’s number one shopping street in 2012. Indeed, the prime retail therapy district is filled with a crazy number of malls. While shopping isn’t for everyone, do visit ION Sky at level 56 of ION Orchard. The indoor viewing gallery grants visitors stunning panoramic views of the city. Access ION Sky from the high-speed lift located on ION Orchard’s level four. 2 Orchard Turn, Level 56, Singapore 238801 As mentioned previously, there is really a lot to do other than just shopping at Orchard Road. Make your way to Library@Orchard and pick up a book to read from the gorgeous curved white bookshelves. Locating Library@Orchard might be a little challenging for first-time visitors, but the modern library is actually located in Orchard Gateway Shopping Mall (which also connects Orchard Central and 313). 277 Orchard Rd, #03-12/#04-11 Orchard Gateway, Singapore 238858 83-year-old temple Singapore Buddhist Lodge – also a charity institution – serves free vegetarian meals to the public every day from 7am to 7pm. This generous service has been instrumental in easing the financial burden of foreign labour workers and the homeless. If you are thinking of dropping by, note that there is a queue for free food and that the queue is longer during weekends. 17 Kim Yam Rd, Singapore 239329 The 10 km-long Southern Ridges connects a myriad of nature parks, namely HortPark, Kent Ridge Park, Labrador Nature Reserve, Mount Faber Park, and Telok Blangah Hill Park. It is a hike that all nature lovers must embark on – as this long trail will allow you to encounter a wide diversity of flora and fauna. Do remember to make a pit stop at the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore called Henderson Waves. A wonderful architectural not to be missed; you will definitely find yourselves marveling at the bridge’s undulating wave-like design. You can even visit at midnight, as LED lights will softly illuminate the bridge. Henderson Road, Mount Faber Park, Singapore 099203 Entrance fees to Gardens by the Bay’s Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are pricey, but that does not mean you should miss out Singapore’s best tourist attraction. Instead, visit Gardens by the Bay in the evening and head to the Supertree Grove – home to 12 majestic Supertrees – at 7.45pm and 8.45pm to catch the enchanting Garden Rhapsody Light and Sound Show. We have seen this spectacular display countless times, but the novelty just never wears off, ever. 18 Marina Gardens Drive, Singapore 018953 Standing 25 metres above ground and spanning 250 metres long, the scenic TreeTop Walk is a suspension bridge located in Singapore’s oldest reservoir. Bear in mind that the freestanding bridge is very narrow; hence people are only allowed to cross it in a single file and in one direction. Do show up in sports attire for your own safety, as the route up TreeTop Walk is mainly unpaved. For the quickest way to get to the TreeTop Walk, start your walk from Venus Drive’s car park. 601 Island Club Road, Singapore 578775 About the Author: Hui Jun Ng is an avid traveller who shares her personal travel itineraries on her blog, The Keepers Map.

I think it’s more like 9km?I didn’t know about the free drinks in ce la vie, pretty nice touch, I’ll have to try it out! Fantastic information! I’ve never even considered Singapore as a destination partly because of the high prices, but all this stuff looks so cool! What amazing value. When you mentioned free drinks and vegetarian meals at the beginning I thought that must’ve been a mistake, but then holy crap it’s actually true xD Singapore is beautiful. I love how you listed many options especially for those who are intimidated to visit Singapore thinking it is an expensive destination to travel to! I haven’t seen or visited some of these so I couldn’t wait to go back! Definitely don’t agree with recommending the free vegetarian meal. Just because anyone may be able to get the food doesn’t mean they should. If you can afford to travel the world then you should be able to afford to not take something that is helping the burden of homeless people. i love singapore, more greener roads, Fort Canning Park, Mount Faber, HortPark and Southern Ridges. The cruise experience was awesome. I agree with Anne’s viewpoint that the Buddhist Lodge’s free meals like many such institutions in the world are provided for the needy and as such should not be recommended for travelers who can actually afford to travel around.Alms and donations from believers and other groups in the society go into making such meals possible to the needy. From using the funds to procure and source for the ingredients to food preparation and the washing of dishes, much of the work are done on a volunteer basis that align with Buddhist beliefs and values.Though I am in no position to stop anyone from going to such free meals, I think it would be good to give back in the form of donations or alms if you are just going for the experience. If not, for cheap eats that are not ethically debatable, Hawker Centers all over Singapore is a good alternative, it has been suggested in the blog post so i should not delve too much about it.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-singapore-cocktail-bars/,The Best Singapore Speakeasy Cocktail Bars,Singapore,"Singapore is home to a plethora of awesome speakeasy cocktail bars. For those not in the know, the speakeasy concept basically refers to watering holes with inconspicuous façades. These places are intentionally hidden away in plain slight but the agenda behind their obscurity has evolved drastically over the years. Several decades ago, speakeasies were created out of necessity during the Prohibition era. Back then, production, importation, sale and consumption of alcoholic drinks were considered illegal. People had to visit illicit establishments to consume liquor and everything was kept hush-hush to ward off police raids. Today, the ban has lifted and there is no need for secretive operations. Yet, many cities across the world are attempting to recreate Prohibition-era themed bars because the novelty of discovering a ‘hidden’ gem is not wearing off any time soon! From the newly opened Lucky Bar to the world-famous 28 Hong Kong Street, here is a guide to 8 Speakeasy Bars in Singapore and what drinks to order at each:  Located in the Queenstown precinct, Aqua Luna is an under-the-radar beauty that seriously deserves more attention. The quiet swim-up bar floats atop Hotel Alexandra’s infinity pool and offers visitors a clear view of the gorgeous Interlace Condominium – which by the way, won World Building of the Year 2015. If you are searching for something unique, we suggest you try their Hot Melon cocktail. The sweet-and-spicy creation is an outrageous concoction of dark rum and chili. Fortunately, the beverage’s spiciness has been largely reduced by sour sop sorbet and fresh watermelon. Address: 323 Alexandra Road, Singapore 159972 Award-winning 28 Hong Kong Street has no visible signage to indicate its presence. The unassuming paneled door has deterred the uninitiated from visiting it. My advice to first-timers? Just keep a lookout for the unit number ‘28’ when strolling down Hong Kong Street. Despite its nondescript location, 28 Hong Kong Street has won a legion of loyal fans with its artisanal cocktails and delicious bar nosh. It’s ranked #1 in Asia. Most patrons order the bar’s Old Fashioned served with a hand-cut ice cube. Oh and you definitely won’t go wrong with their divine Truffle Mac and Cheese Balls. Address: 28 Hong Kong Street, Singapore 059667  Bitters & Love is conveniently situated in heart of the central business district, but locating the concealed bar might be quite a challenge. There is no signboard and the entrance is every bit as characterless. Despite all that, the small venue is packed with eager customers every day. If you have a sweet tooth, then you must try their signature Kaya Toast Cocktail served with Kaya Bread. You will be surprised by the complexity of this treat. English Breakfast Tea, Mount Gay Rum, peach liqueur and a sheer amount of kaya are just a few of the ingredients used. Address: 118 Telok Ayer Street, Singapore 068587  Two-month-old Lucky Bar is Holland Village’s newest tenant but even nearby residents remain clueless about it. There are two ways you can enter this bar; either through Full of Luck Club restaurant’s second floor or via an alleyway of Holland Avenue. The latter is the only option left if you visit after 10.30pm. Lucky Bar’s indoor lounge is sleek and chic, but it is the breezy outdoor deck that we prefer. Lit by pretty fairy lights, Lucky Bar is the perfect place for a low-key meeting. The bar menu features a comprehensive selection of Asian-inspired handcrafted cocktails, spirits, beers and bar bites. Address: 243 Holland Avenue, Singapore 278977  Make your way to the intersection of Club Street and Ann Siang Hill and spot the scribbled arrow on an unidentified white building. Open the glass door; head down the dark staircase and you will be greeted by a spectacular display of 6,000 hanging light bulbs. Welcome to Operation Dagger. Ranked as #21 in the world, cocktails are serious business in Operation Dagger. I love the Hot & Cold cocktail and it is literally hot and cold. Two distinct layers characterize the drink; the top warm layer consists of coconut and the lower chilled layer comprises pineapple and chilled rum. Address: 7 Ann Siang Hill, #B1-01, Singapore 069791  I remember climbing up the dingy shop house staircase in complete darkness, completely uncertain whether or not we were at the right location. But pushing through the retro doors, we were instantly teleported to our grandparents’ time. The Spiffy Dapper is dark, mysterious and slightly eerie. State your preferred poison and let the bartender shake up a bespoke cocktail specially just for you. Interestingly, The Spiffy Dapper doubles up as a café called Dapper Coffee by day. If you are visiting in daytime, do get a bottle of Unicorn Tears. The drink SPARKLES! I kid you not. Address: 73 Amoy Street, Second Floor, Singapore 069892  Japanese speakeasy bar The Horses’ Mouth is tucked in the basement of Uma Uma Restaurant. Most people are unaware that the bluish curtain – which appears to be restricted to staff only – is actually the gateway to a secret bar. Walk down the stairs and viola, you’ve arrived. The lounge is classy and perfect for a romantic date, but do be warned that food and drinks are pricey. Here’s a piece of advice: The price of ramen is cheaper at Uma Uma Restaurant than at The Horses’ Mouth. So you might want to dine at the restaurant first before heading downstairs for some tipples. Address: 583 Orchard Road, #B1-39, Forum Shopping Mall, Singapore 238884 The Library is a pioneer in Singapore’s speakeasy scene and its concept extends beyond its location. You will need a password to enter the specialty cocktail bar. Some argue that it is of too much hassle, while others deem it fair to gain entry. But we will just spill the secret to you; the password is on their Facebook page. The drinks menu is extensive and guest bartenders do make a special appearance from time to time, but the most iconic cocktail since The Library’s inception would be the Duck Bath Fever, which features a rubber duck swimming in a tub of akvavit, coriander, gin, bitters, hops and pineapple etc. Address: 47 Keong Saik Road, Singapore 089151 About the Author:Hui Jun Ng is an avid traveller who shares her personal travel itineraries on her blog, The Keepers Map. She is aware that travelers spend an exorbitant amount of time planning their trip(s) and she wants to help.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/singapore-hotel-guide/,The Singapore Lifestyle: A Guide to the City’s Best Hotels,Singapore," Singapore is one of those countries that, like an onion, is muti-layered and has so much to discover beneath the surface than meets the eye. I spent 6 days there as a layover while en route to Los Angeles, thinking that might be too long, only to find that I left wanting way more time. People told me that there’s not much to do in Singapore, to only stay for three days, and that it’s a budget eater. In reality the food is endlessly interesting and delicious, with hot spots all over the city and its surroundings, the culture is equally varied and fascinating, and the nightlife is tons of fun. Considering the value for the money, it’s not tough on the budget, either. It was six days that I won’t soon forget, spent meeting amazing local people and enjoying the local art, cuisine, and culture. This so often gets overlooked by passers through and that’s a real shame. Here’s how to enjoy Singapore to the fullest for any budget or travel style: Another guest said it best when, randomly at breakfast, she made conversation with me by saying, “isn’t this a nice place? I love how everything is included, it really makes you feel looked after!” I couldn’t have agreed more and was thinking the very same thing. The Quincy Hotel is a brand new boutique hotel with an edgy vibe. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful (which I would come to find was true of the wonderful Singaporean culture) and what I loved most about it were all the added extras: free food all day from breakfast until dinner, free cocktails from 6:30 – 8pm, complimentary mini bar and WiFi, and a 24-hour pool and gym. I haven’t been to a hotel before that offered all of that. Their “staycation” package aimed at locals who want a vacation at home also includes an afternoon cupcake class, the bounty of which we enjoyed tremendously at my reader meetup a couple days later. The location was great, too, located an easy 5-minute walk from the Ion mall. Now normally malls aren’t my thing, but this one has a food stall market in one of the lower levels that serves up all kinds of delicious food, including the famous chicken rice (steamed or roasted chicken served at room temperature, served with rice cooked in chicken broth, chili paste, and soup). Nearby: The Ion mall for foodies and an easily accessible train station for a jaunt over to the Super Tree grove at the Gardens by the Bay, which has hourly light shows starting after sunset. Be sure to walk along the sky walk to get the full experience. I was so impressed by them, I went twice. They’re also open any time, so if you fancy a 4am jaunt to the trees, go for it! A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on May 4, 2015 at 8:16pm PDT  Located in the heart of Little India, Wanderlust is for visitors who like something a little different, and very quirky. Depending on which level you stay on, everything from a music and color-themed room to one that is decorated like a treehouse can be your home for a few days. I was housed in what is called the princess room, which was all white and had backlit cutouts. Apart from the super inventive themes and design, what really stood out to me was the amount of thought that went into the guest experience outside of the hotel. They gave me a cell phone for use for the entire time I stayed with them, which meant that everywhere I went, I had internet and a map to guide my way. Every time I took it out of my purse, I thought about my lovely hotel and how nice they had made my stay by thinking of this little detail. Nearby: Think that there isn’t any street art in Singapore? Think again. The hipster neighborhood of and around Haji Lane has coffee shops, bars, and boutiques with tons of personality. I loved poking around the shops, but the one-size-fits-all clothing simply isn’t made for someone who is 5’8! Too bad, because the outfits were super cute and I was so hoping for a Singapore piece! Let’s not forget the amazing food of Little India, to boot. Talk about great service and attention to detail – if you want to feel completely pampered, the Regent is perfect. With delicious Italian, Japanese, and Cantonese restaurants as well as the Manhattan whiskey bar, you can travel the whole world on a culinary journey without even setting foot outside the hotel. The clear benefit to me of staying in a hotel this luxurious was the customer service. When my jet lag was so bad that I slept into the afternoon one day, they packed me a sandwich from Basilico, the Italian restaurant, to take out with me when I explored the city that evening just so that I wouldn’t have to waste time on worrying about food. I didn’t have to ask – it was just waiting for me. When I had to catch a super early flight out the next day, they once again packed me a snack so that I wouldn’t have to go hungry. That’s the kind of thing that really makes a luxury hotel worth it, and a joy to stay in. Well, that and the bed, of course: I also tend to find luxury hotels in Southeast Asia to be a phenomenal value. For this price in the US, it would be pretty difficult to stay in a hotel as nice as the Regent. If you have luxury tastes, satisfy them when visiting Singapore to get the full VIP experience without the cost you’d encounter in the US or Europe. Nearby: The Regent is located right next to the botanic gardens, which are also open quite late. If the heat of the day is too much for you, go for a wander early in the morning or late at night. It’s easy when you’re laying your head right next door. There is also a super convenient bus stop located right in front of the hotel which can take you anywhere in the city. My first night in Singapore was spent in the Tree Inn Lodge hostel in Chinatown. What really made the place great was the staff and the location. Being so close to the best food hawker centers in Chinatown and chatting with the staff led me to the famous Singaporean carrot cake, which was a highlight on my first day in the country. Tree Inn bills itself as a “green” hostel, but I wouldn’t say it necessarily does much over the norm to keep things green, which is to encourage guests to use less water and turn off lights when not in the room. It’s your typical backpacker style  accommodation with dorms, make-it-yourself bed with bedding, towels for rent, and communal living. It’s not luxurious by any means and dorms always will be more about savings than comfort, but this is a good one if your budget is tight. Plus, the staff really is great. Nearby: yummy Chinatown noms. For my best hawker food recommendations, check out this post. Basically, regardless of what you’re looking for, you can find it in Singapore, a city with lots to see and do. My best tip? Stay in each place, and experience a full range of city offerings. *Some of the above rooms were provided to me as part of a media stay, and some I paid for myself. The above reviews are my honest opinions of each property. You will never read a positive review on this site of something I did not love. Your trust always comes first.  I stayed in Singapore for 6 nights last May, and like you told 3 days was plenty. Are you kidding, I wish I’d had an extra fortnight, and that was just for the food; so many things to see and take your time over. Wonderful place for a tourist, excellent transportation, corruption free, and (handy for me) English speaking. Agree it’s so easy to get around, you don’t have to worry about getting robbed or for personal safety much, and there’s a lot to it, plus surrounding islands and really cool people. I want to stay in that Wanderlust hotel…it looks so different! It was super cool! There aren’t a lot of “middle of the road” places in Singapore which is why I don’t think as an extreme budget backpacker it would be all that great, though hostels and the cheap hawker food make it doable. Singapore is a luxury destination for sure! I love Singapore. I always try to stay a couple nights when I’m passing through. These all look AH-mazing… how do you even choose?! I’d base it on location I think, since they’re all great hotels with different perks in very different areas 🙂 Agree that there is so much to do in Singapore and that the food is endlessly delicious 🙂 Yes and so varied! Heheh I should be so lucky to call this home!My favourite ultimate luxury dig has to be the W Hotel on sentosa though. Though it doesnt have the view Marina Bay Sands has, the ambience and service is top notch!  And theres so much more to do as a tourist in Singapore apart from eat. This site has great articles (; Not affiliated to them in anyway but thought I’d share http://www.thesmartlocal.com/read/free-things-to-do Thanks for the suggestion I’ll have to check it out. Agreed there’s a lot to do apart from eating, but that was top of my list 🙂 Omg this is amazing  so fancy and modern Wow, the first shot is killer shot (for super tree grove)Well i live in Singapore so do not really need to checkout any hotels. But when people ask me any cheap options to stay in Singapore, I could not find any. BTW did you explore or able to find any budget hotels here? Yes the hostel I have listed. Otherwise I don’t know of any “budget hotels” and believe it’s probably best to just go cheap with a hostel or pay more and get something nice. The pricing is reasonable for the value/luxury return Oh wow, wish I’d seen this before we went. The Wanderlust hotel looks SO cool – would have preferred to shell out an extra $15 a night and stay here! We stayed in Little India also but in a SHOEBOX. Literally a shoebox, and for $115 a night.Sharing a room and bathroom that small for five nights is never, ever good.Will keep this in mind the next time I’m there! ah man! Just a little more $ can go a long way in a place like Singapore where middle of the road seems not to really exist. Live and learn, I know I’ve had my fair share of crappy accommodations but have (more or less) lived to tell the tale. Hi! Chanced upon your blog and read that you have visited Singapore, even more happy to hear that you liked it! Like you, my hubby & I had left our corporate lives to explore alitte more about the world. We are currently in Germany and planning to head to Africa and saw your blog post about Africa. That’s really helpful! 🙂 Do let us know if you are ever back coz we will love to bring you around our sunny city! Cheers, Franza & Aloysius Thanks so much for your kind comment! Glad that you’re enjoying Germany and looking forward to your impressions of Africa! Which countries will you be visiting? We loved Singapore as well and didn’t break the bank to enjoy our stay. We got a hostel in Geylang, got the weekend metro pass and loved the food, sites and people. Can’t stop thinking about the food. I found the people to be friendly too! Singapore is one of the amazing places to explore. Such an amazing article, thanks for sharing. I would like to suggest you that also do visit India, It is a Fabulous place to explore!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/singapore-hawker-center-food-guide/,Carrotless Carrot Cake – A Singapore Food Guide,Singapore,"“You took the busses here?” He looked at me incredulously, “I don’t think anyone has ever done that before, how did you find your way?” Roy at the Tree In Lodge in Singapore’s Chinatown was baffled. It was just past midnight as I finally checked in after over 24 hours of flying (on the cheapest RTW ticket ever), and he was shocked I’d somehow found my way as a first-timer there. It had been pretty easy, I loaded the bus directions on Google maps back at the airport when I still had WiFi, then followed the instructions, the little blue dot from the satellite following along. It was a cheap and very local way to get around – a combination of my favorite things when traveling. I bid him goodnight in Mandarin, which, combined with the bus mastery got me an in-ticket to some local knowledge the next morning when I went hunting for food tips. We pored over the book, There’s No Carrot in Carrot Cake, an excellent picture guide to Singaporean hawker stall cuisine, and picked out various foods I simply had to try, and the exact places where I’d find the best local, non-tourist food. Singapore has the reputation for being expensive, and it is, unless you know where to look. You can eat very well and very cheaply at the hawker centers, which are basically open-air markets with food stalls serving up snack to meal-sized portions. It’s typical to order a few different dishes and share them around with friends. He suggested the hawker center at Tong Bahru in Chinatown, which was full of locals that Sunday morning eating delicious and cheap takeaway food. He was right, I was the only foreigner there. It was awesome. Chai tow Kway, Singaporean carrot cake, is made from egg, stir-fried radish cake made with daikon and rice flour, and seasonings, then garnished with spring onion. Roy at the hostel suggested I eat it together with chwee kueh, a steamed rice cake with pickled radish and chili relish. Slightly gelatinous, a bit oily, but bursting with tangy pickled and spicy flavors, it makes for a filling and delicious breakfast. So, no, there is no actual carrot in Singaporean carrot cake. The name in Chinese literally translates to ‘vegetable head cake’, a misnomer for ‘radish’. My two meals plus a passionfruit juice cost me SGD $5.70 (USD $4.28).  It could have easily been shared by two. In fact, I took most of the chwee kueh back for Roy.  Glenn, a local Singaporean reader who invited me for lunch the next day, had suggested Komala Villas in Little India for cheap and delicious vegetarian Indian food. He knew it was important to me that we not have “tourist food,” but rather the food that locals eat in Singapore. Komala Villas met both requirements: affordable and frequented by locals. My roti and dhal dish kept me happy, plus I never pass up an opportunity to forego cutlery and dig in with a hand (the right one out of politeness, of course). Remembering the delicious hot drink from Nepal, I ordered a chai tea which came in two cups. When I looked at it curiously, the waiter poured the spiced, milky chai between two cups just as I’d seen done in Malaysia when ordering teh tarik. The result was bubbly, sweet goodness which I savored despite the heat of the day. Thanks, Glenn, that was a winner.  “Really, stingray?” I asked Ken, a fellow American who has been living in Singapore for the past four years. He was very enthusiastic about the stingray, insisting it was delicious. After my reader meet-up near the Marina Bay a few of us decided to jump into a taxi for some good ol’ night market-style hawker food, and he insisted this was some of the best. Located on the water and a bit outside of what would be considered downtown, I have to agree, it’s great for seafood. Another reader from the meet up, Kasia, and I apprehensively tried the stingray with spicy green onion sauce and rice and you know what? It was phenomenal. The steak-like texture of the flaky white meat and the complete lack of fishiness plus the spicy sauce and a beer to wash it all down was perfection. Sitting on the rock jetty afterwards with a couple of beers while watching the city from a distance and enjoying the finally-bearable temperature (Singapore sits on the equator and is always pretty hot and humid) of the calm night was a great way to finish off the meal.  Most Singaporeans will agree that while there isn’t a specific Singaporean cuisine, two dishes stand out as unique to the city-island: carrot cake and laksa. Singaporean laksa is made with rice noodles, spicy coconut broth, and prawns which impart a good deal of prawn flavor into the soup. It’s a soup of the Peranakan cuisine which is a mixture of Chinese and Malay ethnicities, present in Panang and Melaka in Malaysia and in Singapore, as well as a few areas in Indonesia. Most locals also agree that the best place to get it is in Katong, a neighborhood of Singapore. I rode for 30 minutes on the bus to try this soup, apprehensive because I know that I’m not a seafood fan, but, as in the case with the stingray, am always willing to try. The best way to describe my feelings towards laksa is to quote my vegetarian sister, who will often say, “that looks good for people who like that kind of thing,” when a meat dish arrives at the table, appreciating that it must taste good, but not to her palette.  That’s how I feel towards laksa. I can tell from the creaminess that it is hearty and tastes great, but the fishiness is just too overpowering for me. But don’t let me sway you if you’re a seafood lover, because everyone else who has tried it thinks I’m crazy.  These are a few of the foods that stood out during my 6-day search for the best hawker food in Singapore. My goal was to find the authentic and the off the beaten path eats that wouldn’t be full of tourists. Considering I didn’t see any others at the places I ate, I felt victorious in my quest, though in a city with as many food adventures as Singapore has, it can be never-ending. I was told by many people that Singapore only needs 3 days, maximum, to be explored. I couldn’t disagree more. There’s more than just great food here, and even after an additional week, there’d be much more to see. It’s not as cheap as the rest of Southeast Asia, but fairly on par with the major Western cities of the world. Don’t write it off because it’s not cheap – it’s worth a long visit, and if eating the local, traditional food, doesn’t have to be all that expensive. Do you love eating in Singapore? Would you add to this list (pretty please)? That carrotless carrot cake thing is so delicious! And this is a great post. Last time I went to Singapore, I went with family members and friends who ventured towards some of the “upwardly mobile” joints (which was expensive and made me cringe, haha). So this guide seems like a great recap of the alternative. Can’t wait to go back! The hawker food is really delicious, so there are definitely alternatives to the “high brow” stuff, which I honestly didn’t eat much of, since I’m a street food-lover for the freshness and closeness to locals and this is Singapore’s version of it. So happy you liked some of our food! I’m from Singapore, and the hawker food is something that will stay with me even if I venture overseas x So happy you liked some of our food! I’m from Singapore, and the hawker food is something that will stay with me even if I venture overseas x It was great to try everything! I love exploring a country through its food and felt lucky to have locals showing me around, so I could try the real stuff 🙂 Oh, Tony & I were just reminiscing about our favorite meals in Singapore (a past time for us that is equal parts joy and torture!). Even though we won’t be returning to Asia any time soon, we like to dream of which place will be our starting point on our next visit and we both agreed Singapore would be a strong contender based on the food alone. I’m generally pretty sensitive to fishy flavors, but I have to admit I absolutely adored the laksa in Singapore. The baba laksa (i.e., the ones with coconut milk) are creamy and delicious to me… it’s the asam laksa (like the kind that is famous in Penang) that I find overwhelmingly fishy and can’t stomach. I tried the coconut one but it was still just a bit too fishy. I can tell it would be really good if you liked that kind of thing though, haha. Carrot cake it is 🙂 The carrotless carrot cake sounds amazing!  I’d love to try it.  Although I’d be cautious about the stingray, I know you have to try things when you get the chance, because you may never get another opportunity.  Can’t wait to hear more about Singapore! I always figure I can at least handle a bite. If I hate it then I won’t keep going, but half the stuff I love to eat now, I wouldn’t have tried in the first place if I listened to my fears! Tom and I have never been to Singapore, but got totally obsessed with roti canai in Malaysia! All that delicious ghee, Mmmm. It is the closest thing I have ever tasted to legit San Diego Mexican shop flour tortillas. Though I am pretty sure the ones in San Diego are made stretchy and delicious with lard instead of ghee. OH MY GOD roti canal! I am equally obsessed. With a milo dinosaur. In a bag.  I am also a tortilla enthusiast and it’s OK with me if they use lard 😉 Great post !!I want to try everything I always think that the best thing when you travel is the food is always different I’m so glad you came to my hometown and liked it too! I hope that when you do visit again you would take the bumboat out to Pulau Ubin and also walk up the Henderson Waves! I wanted to see Pulau Ubin but ran out of time! Next time 🙂 Give me a buzz if you ever come again and I will bring you to real heartland locals hangouts. Places like Little India’s Komalas and stuff in Chinatown are very touristy actually, not that many locals would agree that these are the normal everyday meals although they do give very nice ambiance. Ok, take me to the hangouts. Heya, Pics of the food are so tempting. I can’t wait to plan a trip to Singapore, Thanks for sharing.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/thailand-things-to-do/,Thailand Bucket List: 50 Things to Do,Thailand,"Oh, Thailand, the Land of Smiles, one of the easiest places to travel through in the world, and one of the best values for your money out there, too. When planning a trip to Thailand, it’s understandably hard to narrow down the best of the best, but a girl’s gotta try, right? Here are 50 bucket list items in Thailand to consider adding to your list:  The White Temple in Chiang Rai is like no other. After years visiting countless temples around the world, the White Temple remains one of the most interesting temples I’ve ever laid my eyes on. A massive project that will remain under construction until 2070, the White Temple is a compound with beautiful and strange sculptures like hands reaching out from the depths of hell to vibrant guardians of paradise. There’s a trippy mural on the inside as well that I don’t want to ruin for you, but think Sailor Moon and Neo from the Matrix. If you can only see one place in northern Thailand, this should be it. Blog post: Words cannot describe the White Temple in Chiang Rai Wat Rong Suea Ten, known as the Blue Temple, is another non-conventional temple in Thailand that should be on your bucket list. The combination of blue and gold results in a stunning and unique temple. The bonus? No entrance fee is required.   Meanwhile in Thailand… got so many awesome adventures planned. Found some hidden gems. Stay tuned! A post shared by  Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jan 17, 2018 at 7:27am PST Better known as the Silver Temple, Wat Srisuphan is covered by hammered silver designs made by local artisans. The outside is intricate, with allegories of the Tipitaka and the world capitals displayed on the walls. It’s an easy and quick pit stop near the South Gate in Chiang Mai and only costs 50 baht. Sadly women are not allowed inside (but we still get to pay the full rate!), but the outside is still worth seeing. Blog post: 5 delightfully unique temples in Chiang Mai, Thailand Are you seeing a pattern yet? There are just so many interesting temples in northern Thailand! Not that I am complaining, as they were all so refreshing to see, and so different from each other. The Black House is a large compound with more than 10 temples that share a common theme – black. Walking through the Black House you’ll see some bizarre displays, such as a chair made out of animal skulls, and a darkened crocodile skin.   Golden hour vibes 🌞 it’s amazing revisiting Thailand, truly the land of smiles. • • • • • On another note, much love and respect to the women around the world who marched yesterday. I honor and stand with all of you. I couldn’t participate from where I am, but I did a little march of my own to Thailand’s 3rd tallest mountain today 💜🙏🏻 A post shared by  Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jan 21, 2018 at 6:39am PST The Doi Suthep Pagoda may remind you of the Golden Pagoda in Yangon, Myanmar, if you’ve been. I recommend visiting this at golden hour, just before sunset. The setting sun reflected on the shiny, golden pagoda is beautiful, followed by the sun setting over Chiang Mai. You may also join the locals as they walk around the pagodas with a stem of flower in their hands while chanting prayers, like I did in the photo above.  Doi Inthanon National Park is home to several waterfalls, a nice nature trail, and Thailand’s tallest peak. The park’s most famous feature are the King and Queen Pagodas, which also have sakura blooms in mid-to-late January. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the park since it’s big with a lot to see, and a steep entry price to boot. It takes about three hours to reach the top from Chiang Mai by car. You can also take a taxi, tour, or motorbike. Blog post: 8 amazing day trips from Chiang Mai For the adrenaline junkies, consider joining the Flight of the Gibbon in Chiang Mai, an experience that allows you to zipline through the dense forest (it is the longest single zipline in Asia). It’s probably the best place in northern Thailand to channel your inner Tarzan (or Jane).  Pai, just a few hours outside of Chiang Mai, is a hippie oasis I went back to again and again. It’s not uncommon to meet people in Pai who only meant to stay for a few days, and extended to a few weeks or more. There’s just something about this hippie town that’s so easy to fall in love with – perhaps it’s all the waterfalls, the canyon, or the delicious food, or all three? Blog post: Why I’m so hopelessly in love with Pai  If you ask me, the Land Split is truly what makes Pai, Pai. Once a soybean farm, the land cracked one day in 2008, making it unsuitable for farming and destroying the farmer’s crop and income. The farmer figured out how he’d make his living: providing fruit and hibiscus juice spreads to tourists who passed by on their way to one of Pai’s three famous waterfalls. If you are in Pai, make sure to visit and spend an afternoon enjoying the snacks and chatting with the farmer. Want to learn how to dance with fire or pick up some new tricks while hanging out with new friends?  There’s a circus resort + school in Pai that offers just that. It’s a unique experience that you won’t get anywhere else, and I was happy to have been able to pick up some basic fire spinning tricks after just a few hours.  Doi Luang Chiang Dao is Thailand’s third tallest peak, accessible via a fairly easy drive 1.5 hours from Chiang Mai and surrounded by mountain after mountain in every direction. In a word, it’s stunning. The hike itself is steep at first and right at the end, but for the most part it runs through a temperate forest full of friendly passers-by – most of whom are Thai. The cherry on top? The view! Blog post: A guide to hiking Doi Luang Chiang Dao  There was hardly any info about Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn Temple when I looked it up online after seeing awesome drone footage from a Thai tourist. These pagodas dotting the mountain peaks were each carried up piece by piece by a revered local monk and a team of nearly 50 workers just over a decade ago. The amount of love and sweat that went into making this work of art and devotion a reality is astounding, especially when seen in person. I was completely blown away. Blog post: Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat, Thailand’s floating pagodas  The opportunity to interact with elephants is what draws many tourists to the country. Unfortunately, most, if not all of the elephants many have interacted with were likely to have been taken away at a small age, put in a small pen, tied up, and poked, prodded, and pierced for days in order to make them submit. For the remainder of their lives, they are typically controlled with the same sort of stick, with a hook in the end. That’s not something I ever want to support. Fortunately, there is a way to play with elephants ethically. Elephant Nature Park is one of the few real sanctuaries that care for rehabilitated elephants, and I highly recommend visiting or even volunteering. Blog post: The best way to play with elephants in Thailand Each province in Thailand offers cuisine that is “same same but different” (I love this phrase!). In Chiang Mai, check out the Sunday night market full of delicious food, clothing, jewelry, art, sunglasses, you name it. It runs right down the center of the old city from Thapae gate. For a truly local dish, try the Khao Soi curry with crunchy noodles!  Every year, thousands of lanterns are released into the sky at the Yi Peng Festival. To reduce the amount of tourists at the local event, they try not to release the exact dates until only a month or so before the Yi Peng festival. Typically taking place around November – December, if you are traveling in northern Thailand around that time, be sure to ask around and see if you can swing it. Blog post: Yi Peng in Chiang Mai It’s a ton of fun, you learn something new, and your newly acquired skills are possibly the best souvenir to bring home and share with friends and family!  Yes. this place exists – in Thailand, not Mexico! It’s considered to be holy by the locals who make offerings to it yearly. Since it is  considered sacred, swimming, fishing, and feeding the fish are not allowed. I spent a good 2 hours there just admiring the beauty of the surrounding area, watching the fish swim, and enjoying the cool temperatures. It was a true adventure to get to, and there’s almost no available info online, so if you’re interested in visiting, click the post below for more info. Blog post: Emerald Lake, a cenote in Thailand Traveling in northern Thailand is generally pretty easy, especially with help from Songthaews, the local red trucks that go around town picking up and dropping off passengers. However, if you are looking for an adventure, consider renting a car (if there’s a group of you) or a bike to do a day trip from Chiang Mai. You will be able to reach places that are off the beaten path, and stop whenever you want. Blog post: 8 amazing day trips from Chiang Mai Chiang Mai’s very own Grand Canyon is a favorite local swimming spot up north. For a more adventurous experience, you can cliff jump from the canyon into the water. There’s also a Grand Canyon waterpark that’s perfect for a group day trip. Think floating obstacles, ziplines, wakeboards, and of course, a cliff jump.  The cascading mountains of the province of Mae Hong Son, bordering Myanmar, are like a storybook with their misty mountains. It’s a gorgeous journey here from Pai for those who are comfortable driving a car or motorbike. Once there, visit one of the many caves, hot springs, and nature parks. Even if it’s just for a day, driving through there from Pai is a fantastic way to pass the time.  Sukhothai Historical Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is much quieter than Angkor Wat, which I definitely appreciated. Perhaps it’s due to the lower influx of tourists in Sukhothai, or perhaps the locals are simply friendlier here, but I felt extremely welcomed in this little pocket of Thailand. The best thing to do is rent bicycles for the day and explore! Blog post: Exploring the ancient kingdom of Sukhothai From the lavish Siam Square shopping mall filled with LV and Gucci flagship stores, to quirky local boutiques, down to the street markets with the typical elephant pants hanging high, shopping in Bangkok is world class, regardless of your budget and style.  Staying with a local or expat through Couchsurfing has lots of perks. During my 5th visit, my couchsurfing host took me to some local food joints that would be difficult to discover without some local knowledge. He also lived in an area without many tourists, which gave me a different taste of Bangkok – in a good way. I recommend giving it a try, even if it’s just to attend one of their meetups, especially in a big city like Bangkok. Chatuchak is a market in Bangkok that both locals and foreigners like to visit, so there’s still a taste of local culture there. Plus, they sell absolutely everything! Truly talented artists sell their art there, along with one-of-a-kind handmade items that can fit in a backpack. Blog Post: How to Fall in Love with Bangkok Bangkok’s very own central park will bring you some peace and quiet in the midst of the ever hustling and bustling city. It’s a great spot for people watching and seeing locals out playing sports, walking around, and living life, which is something I really dig when I’m traveling.  If you want to see how life is lived away from tourist-packed areas, be sure to check this place out.  Because street food tastes better when eaten on a rocking boat squished between vendors and other tourists! Alright so this one is super touristy, but it’s also uniquely Thai, so if it interests you, check it out.  I personally think that Koh Chang is the perfect Thai island for solo travelers. It’s full of young people, hippie types, and big enough so that everyone can find what they’re looking for there, whether it’s a backpacker haven or fancy white sand beaches. The island is also much closer to Bangkok and therefore easier to get to for people traveling with a time-budget. It’s also lovingly referred to as Thailand’s ‘last cheap island’ which is true. Islands increase in price as you head south! Blog post: Koh Chang, the perfect Thai island for solo travelers  The Red Lotus Sea is famous for sunrise during the lotus bloom from November to February. The open lotus flowers are made even more brilliant by the dazzling colors in the sky – a photographer’s dream! Blog post: 20 of the most beautiful places in Thailand Pad Thai, Tom Yam, Khao Soi, Som Tam, mango sticky rice, curry… these are the words you will be mumbling to yourself after leaving Thailand. The country truly is a foodie’s paradise. A pro tip is to eat where the locals eat, especially places where the menu has not been translated, it’s where you can find authentic, true Thai food. You won’t necessarily know what you’re eating, which is half the fun, no? Blog post: A beginner’s guide to Thai food  Wat Pho was one of the first temples I visited when I bought a one-way ticket to Bangkok six years ago. It is one of the oldest and largest temple complexes in Bangkok, housing thousands of Buddha images, including the reclining Buddha. Try to get there early or right when it’s about to close to avoid massive crowds.  Muay Thai, also known as Thai Boxing, is an extremely popular sport in Thailand. Although every town or city in Thailand has Muay Thai stadiums and arenas, the best and largest Muay Thai venues are in Bangkok. For the most part, it is a thrilling and unique experience that you can’t get anywhere else. Blog post: the best venues to watch Thai boxing in Thailand Enthusiasts from all around the world flock to Thailand to be professionally trained as Muay Thai fighters. While not all of us aspire to be the next Muay Thai champ, you can at least try your hands, and feet, at Muay Thai at one of the many Muay Thai gyms all over Thailand.  A ladyboy is a transgendered or transsexual individual in Southeast Asia. They are a minority group that is quite common in many parts of the world, especially in Thailand. Performing is one way for many of them to support themselves financially, or to save up for the final step of the surgical procedure to become a woman. The performances can be pretty well done, particularly in Chiang Mai and Bangkok. If you watch one, please watch it with an open mind! There’s nothing better than an authentic and powerful Thai massage after a long day walking under the scorching sun. Ask your hostel for recommendations and be sure to check the reviews on TripAdvisor for an awesome Thai massage experience. If you are new to it, be prepared to get your limbs twisted and cracked (in a good way, for most people!).  If you’d like to see more ruins, this is another stop a few hours south of Sukhothai with a lot to show, including a Buddha face that has been grown over by tree roots. It’s pretty cool and worth a day trip over. Though I got scammed by a Tuk Tuk driver on my second day in Bangkok, I’d still recommend including this in your Thailand bucket list, especially if it’s your first time in Thailand. Just make sure to agree on a price before you get in one, and remember you can always walk away and try again with someone else if you think the driver isn’t quoting a fair price.  If you are wondering why Koh Yao Noi, that’s because it is the “no farang” island, a little slice of paradise that tends to attract a much smaller crowd than its neighbors. Even if you’re not usually a resort person, Koh Yao Noi is the place to splurge. Most of the resorts are smaller in size and designed to be eco-friendly with relaxation in mind. I stayed at Paradise Koh Yao for a couple of days on the island and thought it was fantastic. Blog post: Paradise found in Koh Yao Noi The 10-day meditation retreat at Wat Suan Mokkh in Chaiya, Southern Thailand, has been inviting English speakers to learn more about Dharma and meditation for several decades. If you are seeking for a spiritual experience in your Thailand journey, simply show up prior to 3pm on registration day, which is the last day of every month, and register yourself for the 10-day retreat. I wrote down my personal experience here, but keep in mind that almost everyone will have a different experience. Blog post: how to participate in a 10-day meditation retreat at Wat Suan Mokkh  The Sak Yant tattoo at Wat Bang Phra, 55km outside of Bangkok, is performed by a monk in exchange for a small donation of flowers, cigarettes, and incense that is then recycled and sold again in order to keep the wat afloat.  In exchange, the monk considers which of the 80-something San Yant symbols would best suit your needs, and where on the body it belongs. Without any prior discussion, he then gets to work. It is truly the ultimate travel momento! It’s also something to put a lot of consideration into – it’s not just another tattoo, but a deeply religious and cultural symbol. Blog post: Getting a Sak Yant tattoo from a monk  With more than 700 routes to choose from, rock climbing is a must-do during your time at Railay Beach. If you are a newbie, there are many rock climbing schools around to guide you. It’s a great workout that activates muscles that you might not normally use, plus you get a gorgeous bird’s eye view of the beach from the top. There’s also a few places to scramble and play around in the Railay area, as I found out when I adventured to the lagoon. Blog post: Climbing to the Railay beach lagoon  …because it’s one of the cheapest places in the world to get PADI certified, and because there’s so much to see under the sea, and because it’s an exhilarating sport, and because why not?! This little island off of Koh Tao is open each day until 5pm and is reachable by a 15-minute longtail boat. The hike up to the viewpoint pictured above takes about 15-20 minutes and as you can see, is worth it! Tonsai beach was an accidental stop for me when I was traveling in Thailand back in 2013. I passed by on the boat to Railay and said, ‘what’s that one? can we turn around?’ Since then I went back twice. You can rock climb, kayak, or try out slack-line walking, but for me, Tonsai was perfect for doing absolutely nothing. Blog post: When are you coming back to Tonsai beach?  The notorious all-night beach party originated on this very island. Bucket drinks, neon paint, fire ropes, and dancing all night come to mind when one mentions “Full Moon party”. It’s not for everyone, but if you are looking for a crazy night out, the Full Moon party is more than capable of giving you just that. This is a side of Koh Phangan that’s quite the hidden gem. It’s nothing like what Koh Phangan is known for – crazy parties, drugs, international resorts. Instead, what you can find here are basic but lovely beach bungalows, people who end up staying for years, and laid back vibes. When I was there, there were only 4 sets of bungalows dotting the beach. Blog post: Bottle Beach on Koh Phangan Koh Samui is the glamorous sister of the 3 islands – the other two are Koh Phangan and Koh Tao – with luxurious resorts, international quality restaurants, and upscale spas dotted all over the island. If you are in the mood to splurge a little, there’s a direct flight to the local airport on the island, and you can enjoy a nice couple of days lazing on plushy beach lounge chairs with a cold drink in your hand. A ferry away from the popular mainland of Krabi, Koh Lanta is a laid back and relaxing paradise. The island seems to offer the best sunsets in all of Thailand, and the Old Town area is especially lovely. One thing you must do on Koh Lanta is to hire a private boat to go to the surrounding small islands. Chances are, you will find yourself (and the people on the same boat) alone on a quiet, sandy beach. Privacy on a gorgeous beach, what more can you ask for?  This is the jumping off point if you want to dive in the Similan Islands. The coral bleaching has removed some of their beauty, but this is still a popular spot for diving in Thailand and it’s also where I saw my first Manta ray. Blog post: Under the deep blue of the Surin and Similan Islands The tiny island is named as the Maldives of Thailand for a good reason. Once a hidden paradise, Koh Lipe now welcomes tourists from neighboring Malaysia to tourists all around the world everyday. I think it’s the perfect ending to your Thailand trip before embarking on another epic journey to Malaysia (it’s a short boat ride away from Langkawi island).  Backpacking Thailand on a shoestring budget is not only totally doable, but also a lot of fun! I was able to travel on $45/day, and you can certainly go even lower. Backpacking on a budget allows you to be more creative, meet like-minded backpackers, which often leads to epic adventures. While my dorm days are well behind me now, I will always look back on my budget backpacking memories fondly. Blog post: The Thailand Budget Kristin and Ashley: Wow, you put so much work into this post! This is so amazing. Thanks for putting together a truly amazing list of places to visit or things to experience in Thailand. Well written and covers all types of travelers. You are very understanding and try to be inclusive in your posts. You should be proud. In addition, I love your suggestion of ethical treatment of elephants and where you can experience them and volunteer to help them recover.  It is so nice to have a guide like this to work from. This is so much! This makes me more excited to visit Thailand mid, next year. Thank you for this! The bottom line question is – can first time backpackers enjoy Thailand in October? Details – I find your blog to be both very useful for planning and efficiently motivating. This is why I am turning to you for info. My son (21) is inexperienced in backpacking. He and his friend have only October (all of it) to travel, and the friend is persistent (at this stage) on visiting Thailand. My son wants to do some tracking, or at least day hikes. They both want to experience a different culture, so Southern Europe, New Zealand and Australia are not on the menu. In view of the weather in Thailand in October, can they still enjoy their month there (and do some hiking) , or should I suggest to them alternatives like Indonesia or China (that have good October weather and bear some conceptual resemblance to Thailand, but are difficult for newbies) or Peru (which has questionable weather at the time) or Japan (expensive for young backpackers)? Thank you for your help and time – Ofer (from Israel) Thailand would be great in my opinion! There are some day hikes up north worth doing but not as much as you’d find in Indonesia. I don’t necessarily feel that it’s more difficult for newbies there though Thailand is probably one of the easiest places to travel through as a newbie and a young person. China I will say is difficult but rewarding, and Japan is pricey. I don’t know if you have been to any of the following places. If you haven’t, I recommend you check them out on your next trip. Who knows, they may even make your top-20 list.– Phu Tok: an incredible solitary standing red rock in the middle of the rice fields in Isan, where you can ascend the 7 levels of heaven if you don’t suffer from vertigo.– Preah Vihear (the most spectacularly situated) and Phanom Rung (the most romantic), my  two favourites among the many Khmer temples near or just across the border with Cambodia.-Sam Roi Yot national park south of Hua Hin, with the extremely photogenic Phraya Nakhon Cave and the magnificent wetlands (Thung Sam Roi Yot) Wow awesome thank you!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/thailand-packing-list/,"A Stylish, Easy Thailand Packing List",Thailand,"The Land of Smiles has it all: Vibrant culture, delicious food, a price tag that’s easy on the budget, warmth year-round, beaches, jungles, and mountains. The only thing it doesn’t have is snow, thank goodness! If you’re like me Thailand is attractive for a multitude of reasons, including but not limited to the lack of winter. That makes packing a lot easier, and a lot lighter! Most of what you bring to Thailand will be lightweight and easy to roll up and stuff into a compression bag. That means you can bring more things, and take up less space. Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Thailand:  You might be surprised to see that I included a fleece on there. Before you stuff one into your bag, though, consider where and when you’re visiting Thailand. I learned the hard way while at a retreat near Chiang Rai in January, in the mountains in the far north of Thailand, that the weather can actually be quite cold at the higher elevations in the winter months! However if you’re just sticking to the south, like Bangkok and the islands, leave the fleece at home. The rain jacket, on the other hand, is useful no matter where you go in the country. Rainy season in Thailand lasts from June until October but that doesn’t mean it’s the only time it rains. It’s a tropical jungle, so if you want to stay dry, bring a rain jacket! Just make sure it’s breathable and light, because it’ll be hot, too! I usually just bring enough shampoo and conditioner to fill a 100-ml/3 oz bottle and refill on the road. You’ll find 7-11s everywhere and almost all of them sell Pantene and Dove. You’ll also find Nivea, so you can refill lotions and buy deodorant as well – just double check that it’s not the kind meant to whiten your skin, which is unfortunately quite popular in Thailand. I say unfortunately because their skin is beautiful just the way it is, and so is yours!  However I do usually bring my own face wash and facial moisturizer with SPF – two things I’m very particular about. I also advise you bring enough razors with you since Venus isn’t something I saw much over there, and the same goes for menstrual cups, though tampons are somewhat easy to find. I also consider certain electronics to be essential as a digital nomad, though I realize not everyone is in the same boat. If you’re curious, here’s a listing of my camera gear and my favorite electronics bags. In general, Thais tend to dress a bit more on the conservative side. While it’s fine to wear tank tops and shorts, consider leaving the crop tops and booty shorts at home. The only time when it’s required and essential to cover up is in temples, when shoulders and knees must be fully covered in order to enter. This is the motivation behind adding cute maxi dresses to the list, along with buying lightweight pants in Thailand – you can be covered up without overheating. I highly recommend traveling with insurance. Yes, Thailand is generally cheap, but insurance is helpful should the worst happen and you need to get home. There are also insurance options to cover activities like SCUBA diving and hiking, two things that people often do when they travel to Thailand. The World Nomads explorer option is the one that I use and recommend.  I have some more good news, by the way. This packing list can all fit into a carry-on sized bag. For the entire first year that I traveled in Southeast Asia I actually did it carry on only, without wearing the same thing all the time! It’s totally possible. Click here to read more about that or watch the video above to see how I stuff a week and a half of clothing into one small bag. I hope that helps make your Thailand trip easier and more carefree. If you’re still figuring out where exactly to go, what to budget, and how to get around, check out my Thailand guide which should answer all your questions! Happy travels in one of the most beautiful countries on Earth! Get every new post delivered via email (3x posts per week, no spam, ever) Nice summary. I like what you say about everyone’s skin being beautiful. This concern is universal, common among all peoples and cultures. Another thing that shows how we are so much alike. Like with anything with appearance, you want to look neat, take care of yourself, dress nicely, and be healthy, but one must realize that he/she/they are all beautiful, made in the image of G-d (or instilled with a beautiful aura for those who aren’t into religion). I find the skin of SE Asians to be very beautiful, indeed, like anywhere there is insecurity. Some SE Asians tan to be darker while others whiten their skin, I think they are beautiful the way they are, but it is the nature of people and I have my own insecurities (I never liked all my freckles-moles). At least I hope it can be put at the same level as being kind (loving-kindness-how you can give to others), intelligence, being responsible,  secure in your person, trying to make the world a better place, and learning as much as one can while we are here. Thanks Kristin for sharing your inspiring perspective on things in these posts. wonderful blog! thanks for sharing and keep it up! Thanks for the list – and hoping you can help! I’ve been packing for my SEA trip in my 38 litre carry-on size backpack. I have even less than your list packed, but it goes over the 7 kilo carry-on allowance once I’ve added my laptop. I’ve stripped away a lot, but am still over. Does anyone actually stick to the 7kg limit? Because I have plenty more room in my backpack and I seem to have less than many travel bloggers write about for their carry-on luggage.  Am I best to just take the gamble and travel with over the 7kg and hope no one checks? Thanks! I rarely am asked to have my bag weighed, which I’m kind of counting on. If they do, I’d suggest bringing along a string bag that folds up very easily and sticking your valuables in there to carry on if you have to. Thank you for the useful info. I will be travelling solo and want to by stylish and safe. Based on your articles, I have just ordered a personal alarm.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/most-beautiful-places-thailand/,20 of the Most Beautiful Places in Thailand,Thailand,"What are the most beautiful places in Thailand? It’s hard to narrow it down, to be honest. With thousands of temples, tons of gorgeous scenery from north to south, and glistening beaches with towering karst islets, the unique landscape is what has made Thailand so famous worldwide. I’ve spent a cumulative 5 months on the move in Thailand now, and after much research, have found some seriously beautiful spots. Most of my suggestions are places that are out of the ordinary and will have fewer tourists. I tend to like places that are farther off the beaten path and provide a bit more breathing room. With that in mind here are 20 of Thailand’s most beautiful places in order from north to south. I bet there are a few, or maybe a bunch, on this list that you haven’t seen before! The cascading mountains of the province of Mae Hong Son, bordering Myanmar, are like a storybook with their misty mountains. It’s a gorgeous journey here from Pai for those who are comfortable driving a car or motorbike. Once there, visit one of the many caves, hot springs, and nature parks. Even if it’s just for a day, driving through there from Pai is a fantastic way to pass the time. Book your stay in Mae Hong Son here, or check this adorable art farm studio out! Thailand is full of ornate temples, but when it comes to originality, the White Temple wins out. This contemporary style Buddhist temple is unique with its shape, structures, the dazzling white and silver adorning the outside, and the trippy mural on the inside. The style is unlike anything else you’ll see in Thailand, that’s for sure! More on it here. Book your stay in Chiang Rai here or on Airbnb! Pai is a hippie paradise where you can find yoga, a circus school, a land split serving up all things hibiscus, a couple of lovely waterfalls, one of which you can even slide down, and some lovely countryside. But the most unique aspect of Pai is its canyon, with sharp slopes of orange rock winding like a labyrinth. It’s free to enter and easy to get to on a motorbike, like most of Pai’s best attractions. Book your stay in Pai here! Meanwhile in Thailand… got so many awesome adventures planned. Found some hidden gems. Stay tuned! A post shared by  Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Jan 17, 2018 at 7:27am PST  The Silver Temple is a unique temple to visit in Chiang Mai in contrast to the gold featured on most temples in the vicinity. The outside is intricate, with allegories of the Tipitaka and the world capitals displayed on the walls. I wasn’t a fan of the ‘no women allowed’ policy inside the temple. Women still have to pay full price for admission to the temple grounds but aren’t allowed to go inside the main hall. I also just don’t get it, based on my understanding of Buddhism it doesn’t seem necessary, but it’s not my culture and I had to respect it. Still, it’s so unique I put it on this list. It’s an easy and quick pit stop near the South Gate in Chiang Mai and only cost 50 baht. Book your stay in Chiang Mai here! There are also a lot of great options on Airbnb. Doi Inthanon National Park has it all – multiple waterfalls, a nature trail, Thailand’s tallest peak, Sakura blossoms in January, and the famous King and Queen pagoda near the top. It’s a 3-ish hour drive from Chiang Mai to the east and a lovely day or overnight trip. More on that and a few of the other day trips listed below here. Hiking this mountain was a highlight of Thailand’s north for me. It’s the third tallest peak though it’s easily more beautiful than Doi Inthanon’s peak with its starlike shape. The hike can be done as an overnight or day trip, departing from Chiang Mai in the early morning. Find more on how to climb it here. Thailand’s floating pagodas are about as dreamy as it gets. Though remote and only easily accessible with a car from Chiang Mai, Wat Chaloem is one that most foreign tourists still don’t know about. Take a truck ride to the top and climb the 500 meters of stairs for a stunning view of the entire surroundings including the white pagodas – all of which were carried up by hand! Find more info on how to get there here. Very few non-Thai tourists know about this jungle sinkhole that filled in with crystal clear, deep blue water and huge catfish. It’s considered sacred by the locals and to my knowledge, is the only one in Thailand. It’s somewhat difficult to get to and only makes sense in a car or on a motorbike with tires that can handle mud and dirt. For those who do make it, you’ll be visiting something that’s still a hidden gem in Thailand. Go before the word gets out! Find more info, and a map, here. Thailand’s ancient capital, Sukhothai, is often called Thailand’s Angkor Wat. Though nothing can compare to the real thing, the crowds at Sukhothai are much smaller and the ruins are a sight all their own. Rent a bike and cycle around the old ruins for a perfect day activity to break up the journey from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Book your stay in Sukhothai here! Another remote but good one, the Red Lotus Sea is famous for sunrise during the lotus bloom from November to February. The open lotus flowers are made even more brilliant by the dazzling colors in the sky – a photographer’s dream. You can find it here in Udon Thani province. The best way to get there is to drive. Full disclosure, I’ve never been to this glowing wat but it made the list because look at it! The glowing Bodhi tree featured in the image above is only part of the glowing goodness – the ground sometimes lights up as well in swirls of blue. It looks like something out of a movie, especially during the Yi Peng lantern release. It’s located in Ubon Ratchathani Province near the border with Laos. This national park is known for its light-colored baby blue waterfalls which cascade down seven tiers. It’s also famous for its caves, featuring streams and rock paintings. It’s also home to deer and elephants! Find it here. Koh Chang is affectionately called the ‘last cheap island’ by those who frequent Thailand. It’s true, the further you head south the more you’ll have to break your wallet open. For an island that’s closer to Bangkok, not as touristy as many of its southern neighbors, and equally gorgeous, take a look at Koh Chang. Lonely Beach, though not so lonely anymore, is a favorite amongst the backpacker crowd though there are white sand beaches just a songthaew ride away, too! Read more about Koh Chang here.  Book your stay in Koh Chang here, or try glamping! The Surin islands are a stunning collection of rocky islets with some jungle here and there and spectacularly blue water. The more famous Thai islands are known for their sharp karst rock formations but the Surin islands feature flatter rocks, and better diving, too. Though remote, they’re worth a visit and typically included in most Similan Islands liveaboard itineraries. Located on the mainland a short long tail boat ride over from Krabi, Tonsai is popular with rock climbers and slack-liners and those who want a more laid back experience than Tonsai’s neighbor, Railay. For those who don’t want to choose between the two, it’s a short jungle walk between Tonsai and Railay, which is worth it for the adventure to the Railay Lagoon as well. Book your stay on Tonsai Beach here! Koh Yao Noi is my favorite Thai Island to date. It’s not a backpacker haven with thumping music or buckets in bars, but rather an island full of eco resorts and some nice peace and quiet. It’s also popular with climbers and yogis. I love that you can still get a beach more or less to yourself here, and it doesn’t take that long to get to from Krabi or Phuket, two major hubs for flights.  Check this amazing eco resort out! For an island with lots to explore and few other tourists, Koh Yao Yai fits the bill. Unlike its neighbors, Phuket and Krabi, Koh Yao Yai receives far fewer visitors and isn’t set up specifically for tourism, which lends itself well to getting beaches all to yourself, like the one pictured above, Laam Haed beach. Read more here.   Though known for full moon party madness, Koh Pha-ngan is so much more than that. Some parts of the island, like Bottle beach, are so remote that they’re usually accessed by boat, or very bumpy dirt road. The island has so many gorgeous beaches and quiet places to relax. If the full moon party isn’t for you, or if it is, you have a reason to go either way! Book your stay on Koh Phangan here, or get a bamboo bungalow all to yourself! This lovely little island is a diver’s haven and, though not exactly under the tourist radar, still a gorgeous place to hang one’s hat. Rent a quad bike and tour around the island, learn how to SCUBA dive, or just chill on the beach. It’s perfect for all three! Book your stay on Koh Tao here! Koh Lipe’s nickname is the Maldives of Thailand, and given that baby blue water, it’s easy to see why. Located south of Koh Lanta, it’s a bit out of the way of the usual tourist trail which has helped it stay so beautiful and pristine. Book your stay on Koh Lipe here! Those are some of my favorite beautiful places in Thailand, though my search is ongoing (and probably endless). Thailand has so many places to discover, and the best part is that many of them aren’t even known or popular with other tourists yet. Want more visuals? Here’s a video with 8 stunning, hidden places in Thailand:  How many on this list did you know about, how many have you been to, and what would you add? These are beautiful places indeed! Thailand has so much more than the popular cities. this is such Gem on thailand. So many offbeat places you have shown.Thank you for sharing.Loved it Kristin, were you in Pai this last trip? I have yet to go there. Not this most recent trip. I was there five and four years ago. Wow! These photos are so stunnning! Thailand has been on my bucket list of places to visit for quite some time and this post just reinforced why. Most amazing post! All places have own beauty.In some places,  have no knowledge about them.I read your post and now about more places in Thailand.Thanks for sharing this information. Wow, great post. Koh Lipe sounds wonderful, especially since I’m in love with Koh Lanta. On my next Thai trip, though, I’ll first have to spend at least a week at Koh Lanta before moving onwards 😀 How many days would you recommend for Koh Lipe? I assume it’s rather small? I’ve heard you could spend a month, honestly. Oh easily. My personal preference is the North, where you’ll experience the true culture. Changmai in particular. It’s also quite cheap. Hello Kristin,  I’ve following you on YouTube. I would really enjoy your Thailand videos, which I have been planned in June 2018.In most of your videos, you have used drone which gives awesome footage of the hills, beaches etc..I’m planning to carry a drone to Thailand this June. The procedure seems to very complicated.In nutshell can you make a video or any guidelines to fly the drone in Thailand ( Chiang Mai and Karbi ) without breaking any rules and regulations. Many thanksYashus You’re supposed to apply for a permit ahead of time which takes a couple of months to obtain. I’d start the process now and hopefully you’ll get it in time! Thanks, Kristin.Could you plz send the links.where you had applied. https://drone-traveller.com/drone-laws-thailand/ Thanks for taking the time to write this article. It was both entertaining and very helpful. Great glad you like it! I love the Thai islands! You’re right though, you need to explore a bit more to find that slice of paradise!  Wow!! Pics are amazing, Thanks for sharing such an amazing blog, am also planning to explore Thailand next month!! Have fun! These are all awesome!… i had been looking for places thag is less visited and not that popular to most but is very much worth to see. Thank u very much for this.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/thailand-budget/,Tips From the Banker: The Real Cost of Travel in Thailand,Thailand," 2018 update: I originally wrote this post in 2013, traveling in Thailand on a shoestring. I returned this year with a bigger budget, spending more on accommodation and transport, though some categories, like food, have remained the same. You’ll see both options in this post. I’ve now spent five months traveling in Thailand, making it my longest-traveled country on my Southeast Asian itinerary. During my three weeks in Laos and month in Cambodia, I found it possible to travel on an average of just USD$30 per day. Once I got to Thailand, however, keeping costs low became difficult.  For some reason, I started spending Baht like it was monopoly money, especially in the islands. I had heard previously, and can now confirm, that the north of Thailand is easy on a tight budget.  As one moves south, costs for accommodation start to double, triple, and even quadruple.  Pricey accommodation accounted for my biggest expenditure, and drinks came in at a close second. However, when I considered my overall expenditure, I realized that the costs were still very reasonable, especially considering that I was in Thailand during high season, including Christmas and New Years. My average daily budget for Thailand ended up at $45/day.  Here is the breakdown: Budget accommodation: When it comes to cheap places to stay, Thailand can sometimes cost more simply due to where in the country you are. Back in Laos, I distinctly remember stressing about spending $6.25 per day on a private bungalow in 4000 Islands.  For the same accommodation in Bottle Beach on Koh Phangan, I was paying double.  The most I paid for a room in Thailand when I was traveling on a shoestring was $20, completely blowing my budget, considering I often found $2 accommodation in Cambodia. That said, I was able to find decent and cheap dorms in Chiang Mai and Pai in northern Thailand for a mere $3-$4 nightly. Click here for some great high-value, budget hotel options in Thailand and check out my post on my favorite hostels in Thailand for great budget options. Midrange: Once I returned this year, I only wanted to opt for single rooms. I still found that I could get cheap ones in the north, like the $12 I spent for a private room in Chiang Mai. It was very basic, with nothing more than a twin bed and a shower, but it at least afforded me privacy. The most expensive place I stayed in was Paradise Koh Yao at over $300 per night on Koh Yao Noi, while most of the time, I spent more like $30-$40 per night. Regardless of budget, buses and trains are completely reasonable in price, ranging from $3 to $9 for a bus journey. I highly recommend skipping the tourist buses and opting for public ones. They often cost less, are more comfortable, and are less likely to make stops at expensive roadside restaurants. My main transport issue used to be tuk tuks and cabs, but now with Uber and Grab Taxi, it’s easier to get around without getting scammed on prices. As a solo traveler, I do often have to foot the entire bill, though. I found that in Laos and Cambodia, tuk-tuks would haggle. In Thailand, they preferred to wait until another tourist came along who would pay the asking price. Given that they’re trying to run a business themselves, I can’t fault them for this. However, it made it hard as a solo traveler to save my money. When possible, take songthaews, like from the airport in Chiang Mai or around old town. They’re only 20 baht per trip. Also, if you can’t take an Uber or songthaew, which are generally available only in larger towns, take motorbike taxis as they are the cheapest option.  Always at least try to haggle, and don’t take a taxi that isn’t in a queue.  If someone walks up to you, s/he is probably going to quote an outlandish rate.   The food in Thailand is fantastic and very cheap. Regardless of my budget, I usually eat street food because it’s delicious, fresh, authentic, and is honestly the same thing you’ll get in a restaurant. One can easily eat at a night market, sampling several different eats, for just a few dollars.  Generally, prices are not negotiable and the asking price should be paid.  Prices run from around USD$1 for  a dish like vegetarian pad thai, to $3 for a soup with beverage and rice, or $6 for fresh fish. Where Thailand gets expensive is alcoholic beverages. In Laos and Cambodia, beer runs about USD$1. In Thailand, however, $3 and higher per drink is quite typical. Cutting alcohol from your budget in Thailand could literally save hundreds. Chiang Mai, Pai, Chiang Rai, and other northern cities will tend to be very cheap, with costs increasing as one heads south, especially to the islands. Be sure to check out Koh Chang, lovingly referred to as Thailand’s last cheap island, if you still want an island experience for a fraction of the price. Also consider time of year. High season (December through March) means double the prices for accommodation in most places in Southeast Asia. Thailand is no different. SIM cards are very cheap in Thailand.  I paid only $20 (with DTAC – a Thai carrier) for 3 gigs of 3G over the span of one month.  What’s more, service was great. Massages are also cheap, generally costing around $6 for a full hour. In general, Thailand can be very cheap to visit, especially during low season and in the north of the country.  Even in the south, considering the beautiful beaches and truly delicious eats, Thailand is still a great budget destination.  Thanks for sharing – We are heading to SE Asia at the end of the year so its good to get an idea of costs! Have a splendid time! I am so so glad I came across your webpage. Admiring everything you do.So saving up now for SE Asia. Love this! You are amazing. About to follow you on instagram and add on snap 🙂 Aw thanks so much! Enjoy SEA! This is all great info to know beforehand. thanks! Fasho 🙂 I feel you on the old solo traveller front – I got burned in the South of Thailand for it with accommodation but boy was it worth it! 🙂 Agreed, worth it 🙂 $45 a day sounds like a dream compared to Western Europe, especially Switzerland..why did we not go somewhere cheaper!? True, true. Europe is also awesome though, and must be done at some point in life! Good post! I love that Thailand is so inexpensive. But after Cambodia and Laos, I can see how it occasionally doesn’t feel that way.  I took the buses in Thailand a lot. True, now that I’m in Australia, I have come to wonder what the heck my problem was forking over $20 for a room when now I must fork over the same for a salad. Oh, papaya salad for $1, I miss you!! great information to start planning my next journey! THANKS for sharing! Thanks for the overview. I spent a week on Phuket in January, 1 night in Phuket Town and 6 nights in Nai Yang, apparently the island’s least touristy beach town. A Thai style vegatarian meal cost between $2-4 and the cheapest accommodation near the beach was a bungalow for $20, the cheapest  fan room I found cost $40. I was able to find $3 dorms in Phuket Town with fans, but it was so hot, I bumped it up to $6 for air con.  A rarity for me! Great summary! Thailand is definitely cheap, but I always hear stories of its heyday when prices were more comparable to Cambodia and Laos – it’s still lovely, but I sometimes I wish I could have visited during that time. I wish I could have experienced it long ago too.  Oh well, that’s the way it goes! That’s about what I paid until I got to the islands. If one just traveled in the north, s/he would spend next to nothing. Awesome post!!Really great info! Thankx for the tips! Why don’t u visit sri lanka ? Great post Kristen, love following your blog. Heading out to Thailand and SE Asia in 3 weeks as my first solo trip. You were saying about getting stung with transport and accommodation on your own but I was hoping I wouldn’t be alone for long, meet people and then share these costs. Is this an unrealistic thought?Thanks! There were a lot of times I was able to share as well. It’s just in the smaller towns when I arrived alone and they knew I had no other option that they’d all band together and quote a ridiculous price that I had no choice but to pay. Good read Kirsten, very informative and useful to whoever wants to travel to Thailand. We found it being quite cheap, but in some areas can be a bit pricey probably thanks to the mass tourism developed. Still less expensive than Europe and a beautiful country to visit! 🙂 Hi, I was wondering if you knew a cheaper way to get from BKK down to the islands rather than the expensive tourist buses/trains that go? I found these were setting me back about £20($40) a pop! Any advice would be much appreciated. Take the local train in that case. Where there’s a tourist option, always assume there’s also a local option. Ask the man in seat 61: http://www.seat61.com Hi Im actually looking to go travelling next summer after my college graduation for 3 months in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand. Do you think its possible to fit in 3 months of travelling in a budget of 7000 ? Yes that should be no problem at all. That’s doable on 3-4k once you’re on the ground. This is awesome and very thorough. Will definitely use when I plan travel to Thailand! Glad to be helpful! Hello,  Thank you for sharing, this is very helpful! Me and 4 of my friends plan to travel to Thailand next year so i have a couple questions for you.  1. How do you plan your itinerary?2. Where is a good website to book guided tours in Thailand? or should we book once we are there?3. How safe is the country? is there cities we should not visit?  Thanks  p.s. I will be reading your other blogs 😉 1. I didn’t actually. I just showed up and did things very spontaneously. However this page might be pretty helpful to you for planning if you feel better about figuring it out ahead of time: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/thailand-guide/2. You really don’t need to book tours. Thailand is super simple to navigate and tours are way more expensive than independent travel.3. I never felt in danger there though I’d suggest staying away from Pattaya because it’s just gross and seedy.  Hope that helps! Hey Kristen! I really felt like your advice very helpful. I Love to travel and would like to start a page of my own. Any advice? I’m leaving for Thailand in February and will be there for two months in around a 6k budget. Is that pretty doable? I live in Hawaii on the island of Maui, if you’ve never been here you should definitely visit. Thanks again for your helpful advice:) -Steve Very doable. You can live like a king on that budget and it’s doable for half of that.  I’ve been to Maui! It’s gorgeous. My uncle teaches at UH so I’ve been to Hawaii several times 🙂 Hi Kristin.The hubby and I are looking at traveling to Thailand this year for around 2 -3 weeks. We hope to visit Bangkok, Chiang Mai or Rai (or both!), Phuket and Koh Samui. We want to fit in a reasonable amount of activities and sightseeing, as well as some relaxing. My initial thought would be a budget of around $7000 NZD which excludes flights. This is close to 10k USD. Does this sound reasonable or far too much? I don’t want to share accommodation and would like to stay in mid-range hotels, not a backpackers etc.Also wondered about the ‘best time to visit’ – which I know is a hard one! I was thinking Sept/Oct.Thanks 🙂Steph You don’t need anywhere near that much money for 2-3 weeks in Thailand! I think Phuket is really overrated and if you want something less touristy would suggest Koh Lanta or the beaches in and around Krabi. That time of year is the perfect time to go. Have fun! hi kristin.We are travelling to Phuket in August I’ve heard mixed reviews of the weather there what are your thoughts on this month?.And also what could we expect to pay for dinner for a family of 6?Sounds like you have had an amazing time xx Hi Tina, you’ll have rain but it’s hardly ever all day long. If you eat street food then $6. Stay out of the tourist restaurants and go to the night markets. The food is better and it’s safe. Just pick the popular stalls that have lots of people eating there, including kids. Locals know the good stuff. Very true about prices in Thailand and the difference between north and south. I often get people saying ‘oh I’m going to go to Thailand and live like a king for $20 / day’. Nope, not gonna happen anymore. And in places like koh samui you might even spend more than in many cities in Europe :). I am planning on going to Thailand for one month. I will be staying with my friends so I don’t need to count living expenses. I would just like to know how much you think it would cost. I have read several different articles and I am still quite puzzled on the cost. I have a budget of 1,500$ planned. I’m going to be staying in Nakhon Si Thammarat. What do you think budget wise? Is the budget good? How much money would you take for a month not counting living expenses. That sounds pretty good as long as you’re frugal I’m planning a trip to Thailand the first or second week of December to Phuket. I’m only staying a week. Any recommendation how much money I should take and any great spots to visit. Its a solo trip. What will the weather bee like? Headed to Thailand in mid February to early March. It’s just three of us, and we want to island hop and trek around freely, so we weren’t planning on booking rooms. As it is High Season and as you explain prices to be higher especially in the southern areas, what on your thoughts about being able to get a room in places day of? I don’t want to get there and end up having to pay US$100 per night because we didn’t book anything. We are totally cool with hostels and huts. Again, if they are available as it’s high season.  Do you think there are enough cheaper accommodations in the southern islands to not book in advance?  Thanks for your imput, anything helps! The only time I ever bother to book in advance in Thailand is around Thai holidays or major worldwide ones that result in a lot of people having time off. December and New Years are definitely high season but even then I didn’t book all that far in advance. $100 per night is super high, and when I say it’s double prices down south I mean $20 for a private hut rather than maybe $10, but that varies from place to place. Hi! I just want to start off by saying that I follow a lot of travel blogs, and have wanted to travel for some time now, but your blog REALLY inspired me! I want to do a 3 month solo trip in Thailand from July 1st 2018-August 31st 2018 and I’m gathering all the information I can. So far the only thing I’m a little confused on is how the visas work. If I want to stay for more than 30 days (90 days) do I need a special visa? Or would my best option be to do something similar to what you have done and do one month in Thailand one month in Cambodia and one month in Laos to avoid having to obtain a special visa other than the 30 days. If I do that should I apply for all 3 visas before my trip? Thank you for your help! I hope my questions make sense, and if you’re unsure that’s no problem!! Hey Courtney! Sounds like an awesome trip. I’d suggest doing Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand simply because they’re all great and that’s a good amount of time to split. I got my 60-day Thai visa at the embassy in the capital of Laos and it took two days. You can probably obtain it at home before you go as well. The rules change often over there. Cambodia and Laos you can get on arrival.  Thank you for the advice! Hi! Just getting into the idea of traveling to Thailand and came across this blog! I have a few questions!1. Did you just save for this trip or did you find other form of work while there? (Trade work?)2. What is your recommended place to fly into? (Cheapest, most reliable; I’m coming from the US)3. Would you recommend renting a moped or just relying on public transportation?4. I’ve read that peak weather is from nov-may in northern Thailand, what time would you recommend in regards to travel expenses/holidays? Sorry for so many questions, thanks for this post!! Hey!1. I saved up but you could probably find work online or in hostels2. Bangkok3. Both!4. I wouldn’t go north during the burning season which is from Feb-May Hi,Im planning to travel to bangkok phi phi and chaing mai sept to november with 3 adults and my toddler son. Can i ask, do you know whats the cheapest accomodation thats family friendly (no backpackers) thanks so much. Also, whats ur favourite place in thailand to visit?Ps love your blog! You can find hotels as well for as low as $20 per night that are pretty nice. Check Agoda. HelloWe (husband+wife) are planning in June for thailand., Bangkok, pataya  Traveling 1st time to abroad from india. Plz suggest places to visit . If possible plz guide itinerary. Avoid Pattaya! Hi, I’m planning to go in three countries  this end of month,which is Vietnam,Cambodia and Thailand,how much do you think the budget I need? And what currency of money do I use to those countries?thanks in advance. Hopefully this helps: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/southeast-asia-on-a-budget/ 5 Visits to Thailand 1972 to 2012, next yr. Get there b4 it turns into  another Japan. The culture and landscape are changing fast! See Essan in Central East for most old school cultural experiences. Close to Laos. Visit some Buddhist temples in the mountains for some real fun and beauty, We always eat street food and never get sick. You can stay at resorts for under 60$US a day or Chinese Hotels with a fan for 70$US, a week. All clubs and bars will blow your budget. If you drink with locals at street food places it is cheaper if  you want to chat with nice locals who want to learn English.  Walk a lot and you will be surprised at how much cultural nuance you can discover around every corner. We love it there. Next year we are going to Laos, Cambodia, and hopefully Vietnam. Stay away from Pataya and the area’s around the Airports in Bangkok. Too sleazy and easy to get scammed. Check out the new malls in Korat. Not to buy anything. They are just fun and amazing for a town that wasnt even on the map 50 yrs ago. If you’re back packing it use the bus for town to town travel. Fun way to meet locals. Be prepared. They will want to touch you. Women…do not touch the men/boys in monk robes. It is extremely hot so dress accordingly. I get up early and walk around, sleep in the heat of the day, and party/eat at night. For long stays I recommend the north country. Cheap rates by the month and a lot cooler. Have fun! Thanks for sharing! I liked your post, thanks for the info, thanks for talking -or writting- about costs, that is not very usual! but I am pretty grateful and surprised to see that you can explore Thailand with any budget if you do the proper investigation before Hi, currently looking to travel in august and on a college budget. What was the average flight expense, knowing its going to be the most expensive part of the trip. Any tips on finding cheaper flights? Great info on budget traveling in Thailand. I’m married to a Thai and my wife gets good deals for us because she is Thai – I do sometimes find myself spending Baht like monopoly money though, until the wife steps in and curtails it lol. Nice post – thanks for sharing! Interesting blog! I also went through the other posts and I really had fun reading! Thanks for sharing your travels Kristin! It really inspires me and making me enjoy like once in a while too, instead of just staying at home and spending most of my time working. Looking forward for your future travel guides! Helpful post! A perfect guide for those who are travelling for the first time. Thank you very much 🙂 Excellent breakdown of the costs. I stick to the street food too…well, and 7-11. Then I do the apartments in Bangkok with air. Don’t do the beer, but coffee is a must. Great read! Agreed on the coffee. I’ll spend money for coffee! Hey Kristin, do you know the name of the place in your photo with the infinity pool and beach view? Thank you 🙂 Paradise Koh Yao: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/koh-yao-noi/ hy, we have 2 months for Thailand and Indonesia,  how you would recommend to share the time between those two?  i am not big fan of big crowded noisy cities, and more nature person. They’re both wonderful, though Indonesia is much bigger. You could split time or do 3 weeks in Thailand and 5 in Indo.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/koh-yao-noi/,Koh Yao Noi: Paradise Found,Thailand,"Wading into the coolness, the temperate and refreshing water rippling in waves of periwinkle as I went, I floated into a perfect little bay, surrounded by those iconic Thai rocks that jut up dramatically, perfectly framing the little beach cove. Islets of various sizes and shapes are scattered along the horizon, like a giant walked by and dropped island-sized gumdrops along his way. I’d read before that Koh Yao Noi was the ‘no farang’ island and while that’s not entirely true, it is a little slice of paradise that tends to attract a much smaller crowd than its neighbors. Koh Yao Noi (and neighboring Koh Yao Yai) is a relaxed, eco-minded island with far less tourism than the bustle of Phuket or the thumping party scene of Koh Phi Phi. It tends to cater to a higher end and sporty crowd and has maintained a peaceful elegance that I hadn’t found yet in Thailand. Here’s a video of both islands, including drone footage:  If you want an island without thumping reggae, are cool with ditching the hostels, and just want some peace and quiet in the jungle, pick Koh Yao Noi (but keep it a secret, okay?). For the most part, people head to Koh Yao Noi to enjoy the beach. I know I’ve already waxed poetic about it but I couldn’t get over how perfect the water was for swimming – crystal clear and not too hot and not too cold. It’s also popular for rock climbing, though as a rock climber told me on the longtail boat out, it’s not ideal for beginners. If you have a bit of experience, though, the views while you climb are stunning. Most visitors also rent motorbikes to explore the island’s waterfalls and many beaches with only a few other tourists, if any at all. If you want to check out neighboring Koh Yao Yai, it’s also possible to take a longtail boat over from the south side of Koh Yao Noi for 50 baht, and worth it for an afternoon if you’re a fan of sandbar beaches like this one: Additionally it’s easy to book an island hopping tour or to take out a kayak if you want to explore the islands nearby. Even if you’re not usually a resort person, Koh Yao Noi is the place to splurge. Most of the resorts are smaller in size and designed to be eco-friendly with relaxation in mind. I stayed at Paradise Koh Yao for a couple of days on the island and thought it was fantastic. It’s a secluded, relaxed, and gorgeous high-end boutique resort with hillside bungalows in a dreamy setting. While I’m not as into mega resorts, I love little hideaways like this. It feels like a well-kept secret far and away from anything else, at the end of a national park and close to the uniquely-shaped islands, making each sunrise look that much more amazing. The beach is quiet, without the hum of motors on speedboats or beach touts. The restaurants also serve up delicious food, with fresh ingredients and plenty of Thai-inspired dishes to choose from. If you’re looking for something romantic, Paradise Koh Yao is perfect, though I went there with a friend and enjoyed it just the same. While Koh Yao Noi is not a backpacker place, drawing in crowds looking for a party, it does attract rock climbers and yogis. I find that places with a common interest like a sport tend to be good for solo traveling, because whether people are alone or with others, they’re going to go there for the love of their sport. There are also cooking classes and a few quirky coffee shops and a bar or two, so you’ll have chances to meet others. Koh Yao Noi is easy enough to reach by longtail or speed boat from Phuket and Krabi, both of which have airports. From Phuket, boats depart from the Bangrong pier almost hourly and cost 200 baht. From Krabi, head to the Ta Len pier and catch either a longtail or speed boat. They also depart almost hourly and cost between 150 and 200 baht depending on the speed. To get to the pier, you can take a Songthaew from Krabi town to the bus station for 30 baht, and a larger songthaew ‘bus’ from the bus station to the pier for 100 baht. Reverse the journey to come back and fly out or onwards to your next destination. If you have to hang out in for a day or more on either end of transit, here’s a nice list of Phuket things to do, and more things in Phuket beyond Patong. After a week spent between Koh Yao Yai and Koh Yao Noi, with Yao Noi being my favorite by far for the better views, I left feeling relaxed, recharged, and happy. There’s nothing quite like a quiet jungly beach where you can swim for hours without getting cold, leave your stuff on the beach without worrying too much about it, and feel like you’ve gone back a little bit in Thai time. I hope it stays this peaceful, because it’s on my list of places to come back to. *Thanks to Paradise Koh Yao for hosting part of my stay. My loving feelings towards Koh Yao Noi, and Paradise, are my own. Thanks again for another great find. It looks so beautiful and relaxing. The video was so fun, informative, and conveyed how it truly feels like paradise (even if a little warm, but heck a break from the cold earlier!). Also, as a viewer, I felt like you were very inviting, like a friend sending a message , saying “look what a neat place I found and see you soon!”. You and Ashley interact so well, it is so nice and natural even with the camera there. Hope you two get to hang out again really soon! You look like you really had tons of fun and laughs together even though I realize videos take a lot of work to put together (you make it look easy). You both look great too, it is amazing what true happiness can do to people! You have made Thailand look so fun and nice.Quick question: You mention “no-farang” island. If I travel and go there will they be a little wary of a foreigner like myself? I guess if I went by myself it would be okay versus a large group. I know they will be friendly, SE Asia seems like such a friendly place with nice people, but never want to intrude when they are SO many options available. Also, if I am called a “farang” is that an insult or should I use that term in conversation (besides instructive like you use it)? Or is it a “neutral” word to describe foreigners (I am assuming people from outside SE Asia?).  Thanks for the info! I have learned so much from this. Its not really the no farang island. They still get plenty of foreigners. I think it’s kind of like ‘gringo’ or ‘wai guo ren’ – not really an insult just a statement of you being a clear foreigner.  Thanks for your quick reply and answering my question. Excuse me for asking the question kind of crudely, like I did not recognize your opening statement about how these islands are not really a no-foreigner zone :). I meant to ask if this area is wary about growing popularity from foreigners, like large tour groups starting to go there versus going myself, although the type of people (rock climbers, yogis, solos like yourself) visiting now that you mentioned will preserve and respect the special character. I hope this paradise as all of your “Secret Thailand” finds never get overly developed with the surge of popularity of SE Asia as a place to visit for your benefit to come back and for the Thai people. Your suggestions on how to travel and see these places helps. You’ve taught me how to travel abroad for not only my own joy but also for the benefit of places I want to visit, so I feel free to travel anywhere without the guilt. Thanks for that. Wow it looks really gorgeous! I love the pic of you on the swing <3 Thailand has been on my list for ages. Will definitely try and check out Koh Yao Noi! Glad you enjoyed your stay with us at Paradise Koh Yao!  Let us know next time you are in Asia looking for a bed to rest your head! HI Kristin Thanks for uploading the video and blogging on this place. I’m planning to go to Koh Yao Noi for some rock climbing and yoga. The place that you stayed at  Paradise Koh Yao seems to be near the rock climbing walls and it offers daily yoga. There was not much information on both activities on your blog. Hope you could share on how’s the yoga, massage/spa and climbing there if you have. Thanks. Regards, Emma Roberts I didn’t climb nor yoga while there but there’s the Paradise Koh Yao (from my understanding they don’t organize climbing but it’s worth asking them to be sure. Yes, people definitely climb on that wall you see in the video). Also the yoga retreat on the island is a hangout for climbers if that’s your main goal. I have been there . This Island is an amazing place. Most of the locals are Muslims and they are so friendly. Hey, how was the cellular data reception out here if I was looking to do some work on the beach from my laptop? I’m currently using AIS.  Cheers, Mandeep Ok in some parts less so in others.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chiang-mai-day-trips/,Hidden Thailand: 8 Amazing Day Trips From Chiang Mai,Thailand,"After spending a cumulative five months in Thailand over the past few years, sampling the backpacker’s favorites and finding a few places that were just budding on the tourist radar, it felt like time to go back with a different intention. This time, I wanted to go more local and see things that I hadn’t seen all over the internet yet. Thailand’s north is full of national parks, waterfalls, mountain peaks, and incredible temples. It seems you’d need months to feel like you really saw the best of it, but as it were, I had about a week to road trip around. After hours of driving Thailand’s lovely roads, seeing things I never knew existed here, these are eight of the best Chiang Mai day trips that you’re not likely to see much info on yet. This is the hidden Thailand that you won’t find all over Instagram yet. Some of these you can take public transport to, and others are much, much easier to drive to either by car or motorbike: Compare prices and rent your car here! Doi Luang Chiang Dao is Thailand’s third tallest peak (Doi Inthanon is number one), though the view must be the most beautiful in all of Thailand. Once you get to the top, if it’s a clear day, you’ll see undulating mountain after undulating mountain as far as the eye can see. The rock formations are incredible up there. Like most of the other spots mentioned in this post, this hike was plenty crowded with Thai people, but hardly any other farangs (foreigners). Each person who passed me would smile, respond warmly, and giggle every time I said ‘sa wat dee ka!’ And those who knew English welcomed me to Thailand and encouraged me as I headed higher up the mountain. What a contrast to the short hello or curt head nod that’s common in the Alps or Sierras! This hike is commonly done as a 2 day, one night hike, though it’s possible to leave Chiang Mai very early in the morning to drive the hour and a half up, get to the base, hike up and down in one day, and head back to Chiang Mai for the night, though I’d suggest staying in the area to rest and enjoy the brisk mountain environment afterwards and chill out. To get there, navigate to the Doi Chiang Dao national park entrance. More here on how to climb it. Stay: Hot Coffee Guest House At first glance, it seems like these floating pagodas have to be in Bhutan. Those glowing white and gold structures dotting the sharp mountain peaks look otherworldly, like they could only exist in a movie. I wondered if it would really be that great in person, and it was! Even better, I saw zero farang there, though it was plenty popular with locals. The entrance fee is 200 baht and a compulsory 80 baht fee for the truck to bring you up to the steps, which you’ll climb for 500 meters to the top of the mountain. I recommend getting there very early in the morning to see the mist hang in the hills, and to avoid crowds. To get there, navigate here. It’s about a three hour drive away from Chiang Mai, and can also be combined with the next stop on this list if you want to make it a multi-day adventure. More about the wat here. This sinkhole in the jungle filled with crystal clear blue water reminded me so much of the cenotes in Mexico. It was amazing to see that they exist elsewhere, too. The pool is yet another attraction that doesn’t seem to be very well known outside of the local visitors, who consider it to be a sacred pool. That means there’s no swimming or fishing allowed, but you are welcome to sit and admire all afternoon, which I did! It’s a somewhat narrow and in some parts, dirt road to get there. In this case, it’s both the journey and the destination that make this place interesting. More here. The White Temple in Chiang Rai really is a sight to see. No photo can do it justice – you’ve got to see this in person. This contemporary style Buddhist temple is unique with its shape, structures, the dazzling white and silver adorning the outside, and the trippy mural on the inside. If you’re not driving yourself from Chiang Mai, you can take a green bus for under 200 baht. Though this can be booked as part of a tour for closer to $60 and done as a day trip from Chiang Mai, I highly recommend going the day before, staying overnight, and arriving early in the morning so that you’re not sharing it with as many people. It will still be crowded, but it won’t be anything like the crowds that descend on it by midday. More info here.  Heading west of Chiang Mai towards Doi Inthanon, there are two popular stops – the Grand Canyon which is popular for swimming, and Pha Chor, this orange canyon. Doi Inthanon National Park is home to several waterfalls, a nice nature trail, and Thailand’s tallest peak. The park’s most famous features are the King and Queen Pagoda, pictured here. The park also has sakura blooms in mid-to-late January, which are lovely. The stairs officially close at 5pm to the pagodas, as will the gates that grant entry for 60 baht per person, but you can stay a bit later if you’re already up there. Golden hour is a lovely time to watch as the sun reflects on the golden tops of the pagodas! Watch the video here:  The park entrance costs 300 baht, plus 30 for a car if you drive yourself in. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the park since it’s big with a lot to see, and a steep entry price to boot. It takes about three hours to reach the top from Chiang Mai. A car rental for the day will set you back 1000 baht, and a private car with a driver is closer to 3000. There are also tours available but those won’t give you the freedom to stay as late as you like or pick and choose your activities. The Mae Ya waterfall is also located in Doi Inthanon National Park, though it’s an additional hour of driving round trip to reach it. If you love waterfalls, it’s worth it since this is the tallest and most magnificent one in the park, and it’s a lot less crowded than the other ones will be. The entrance to the waterfall is the same as the Doi Inthanon National Park ticket, so either buy it here if you head to the waterfall first, or retain the one that you buy at the park to show the rangers at the entrance so that you don’t double pay. Navigate to it here. It’s hard to visit Thailand without being tempted by an elephant adventure. However the rumors about riding them are true – it’s bad for the elephant due to the orientation of their spine, and the training methods are abhorrent. If you still want the elephant experience without the guilt, I highly recommend Elephant Nature Park, which is full of rescued elephants with a new lease on life. Trips range from one day to several, giving you an opportunity to feed and bathe the elephants, and to walk with them, or even volunteer on site. The tours will pick you up from your hotel early in the morning and provide transport and lunch. More on my experience here. To be honest, I never considered renting a car in Thailand until a friend of mine who recently moved to Chiang Mai did it for a longer road trip up north. At first I thought he was crazy, but once we got out of Chiang Mai the traffic made way for open roads and a relaxed road trip experience. I’d do it again in a heartbeat. The car was a basic Toyota coupe with 4 seats and a roomy enough trunk. It didn’t have a lot of power to it but it still worked on those winding mountain roads and had great fuel economy. It set me back 1000 baht per day plus gas, but it was worth it for the freedom. One could also rent a motorbike though it’ll take you much longer to get around, however the flipside is it’s cheaper. I’d also heard that an international driver’s license is necessary to drive in Thailand. Officially this is true, however the rental companies don’t generally ask for proof of it and if you do get pulled over, you’ll be fined 500 baht and can retain the receipt to show the police if you get pulled over again. Apparently the ticket allows you to drive for the next three days. Sounds ridiculous but it’s true. All that said, we never got pulled over. Compare prices and rent your car here! Those were a few of my favorite day trips from Chiang Mai, some of which are loved by foreigners and locals alike, and some of which I had never seen or heard of before. I only had about five days to explore, but also highly recommend Pai and Mae Hong Song if you’ve got more. Traveling in Thailand’s more ‘local’ places showed me a side of the country that I fell head over heels in love with. It reminded me of why Thailand is called the Land of Smiles, and showed me that yes, it is possible to see a non-farang side quite easily – you just have to head off the beaten track a little bit. Hey Kristin:Wow, have a complete itinerary for Thailand for whenever I go (it will be a while, but SE Asia has moved up the list)! Between this and the beach discussion in your “Koh Chang” post, you have it covered. Thanks! Another great video, I like the “following your footsteps” to get the feel of the trail. You and Ashley interact so well (and Pete in the other video, he is so funny).Never drove abroad, always was driven by others or took some alternative, but for this and for going solo seems to make sense so a discussion of international driver’s licenses is so appropriate and useful. People seemed to get confused by it.For those who want to get an international driver’s license, in the U.S. it seems to not be a big deal, I just went on the AAA website https://www.aaa.com/vacation/idpf.html and the application seems simple, $20 and passport photos. Never done it though so don’t know if there is something more to it that is hidden. Also in the U.S. they have AAA “stores” sprouting everywhere. Kristin, do you think AAA is good? We have used it a bit but if you think there is something better let me know!!  This other site is good to know the license requirements (it is for UK licensees, but the list is the same for other countries, just if not in EU then follow the guidelines for non-EU), https://www.theaa.com/driving-advice/driving-abroad/idp-country-list . Only thing is when it says “IDP recommended”, it really means you don’t need one if you have a driver’s license from your home country (exception is if you are going to a country that your home country has no diplomatic relations).For those who really want a detailed list, this site provides it:https://www.atlantic.caa.ca/files/travel/IDPRequirement.pdf . It might be too much info, but it might be good to know this for some? Again, just trying to help and this is something that confused my friends when they traveled. In the end, it seems in most cases the rental places don’t care. However,  I also like these lists because they also tell you where you don’t need an international driver’s license (e.g., Israel) so you don’t waste your time and money! I would probably get an IDP if going where it is required and planned to drive since I have extreme dread if ever stopped by cops, even if it is for something benign. However, it is good to know in an emergency where I would need to drive and did not plan on it, that there is “leniency” and I just have to have cash on hand for fines. If you have better sites to look at for this, let me know, you are an expert I trust fully. Thanks for the help! Amazing Thank you! You really are amazing. Your posts are so practical as well as inspiring.I’m passing this on to a friend who is just in the planning stages of a trip to Chaing Mai now!Lisa 🙂 Aw thanks, glad you find them helpful! Wow! All of this looks amazing! I love to hunting these adventure, mountain. I often like to explorer these adventure. Because its my passion. My friend always inspired me to gonna these adventure. So, we along to go for these  mountain to refresh our mind. You are not only a good witter but also a photographer.   Just one thing little thing about the international driving license which you may not have noticed: The mutual recognization is  based on two different international contracts. While some countries have signed both contracts, Thailand only ratified the older treaty from the 1920s.  This sounds all technical but the problem is that most western countries issue international driving licenses according to the contract from the 1960s – and those are actually invalid for Thailand.  While  it seems that most Thai policemen dont know about this distinction, you may face problems with the insuruance if you drive without an proper license (or none). Oh man another layer! Where is Wat Chaloem ? Can you send a google maps link because I can’t seem to find it on Google. Directions and link here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/wat-chaloem-phra-kiat/ was checked 5 times on scooter for international driving license.once i left it at home -> 500 Baht fine, which we were able to negotiate to 300 Bahtin austria it is 15 euros to get one, so just do it    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hiking-doi-luang-chiang-dao/,A Guide to Hiking Doi Luang Chiang Dao,Thailand,"2019 Update: To do this hike you MUST get a guide. The entrance now has guards and those who attempt the hike without getting a guide risk getting arrested. The info in this post is still good and useful for prepping for the hike. Have fun! Doi Luang Chiang Dao is Thailand’s third tallest peak, accessible via a fairly easy drive 1.5 hours from Chiang Mai and surrounded by mountain after mountain in every direction. In a word, it’s stunning.  The hike itself is also lovely. It’s steep in parts, though not overly so, weaving through a jungle over mountain saddles and up to a peak that gives you what must be the most beautiful and expansive view in Thailand. After comparing with Doi Inthanon, this one might not be as tall but it’s so much better. It’s pretty hard to find any concrete information online about this hike. I was left with more questions than answers before attempting it myself: Does one need a guide? Is it necessary to book weeks in advance? Is it possible to do it in one day? We arrived at the park area well after dark the night before we aimed to do the hike. Everywhere I might be able to inquire was closed, so all I could really do was just go and see. Thankfully it worked out, but for those who would like to plan ahead a bit more, here’s what I found out about hiking Doi Luang Chiang Dao: It is now required that you get a guide to do this hike. It’s not really possible to book one the day of due to the park office opening late (8:30am) and sometimes availability of guides is limited. Therefore you must book in advance, at least one day before at the park office, which is in a different location than the park entrance. You’ll need to get there before they close at 4pm. The guide costs 1000 baht and will probably not speak English. That said it’s a small fee, really, and provides a job for someone. I had also read that booking several weeks in advance is necessary. Perhaps this is true during the highest season, though in late January didn’t seem to be the case. It’s also possible to join an organized 2 day, 1 night hike with a guide and porters if you’d like to camp out and see the sunrise and sunset from the top, which must be spectacular. This is by far the most popular option and you’ll mostly be with Thai people, which if the abundant friendliness on the trail is any indication, is probably a pretty cool experience. If attempting in one day, the earlier you go the better. If driving, you’ll enter the park headquarters where you’ll be asked to pay 200 baht per person plus a vehicle fee if you’re driving yourself. It’s also possible to take a taxi. From there it’s a straightforward hike all the way to the top through a gorgeous forest with tropical plants, tall trees wrapping around rocks, bamboo, and in mid January, even some cherry blossoms. There will be several forks in the road with signs that are only in Thai. At each one, veer left and you’ll stay on the correct trail. Towards the end, there will be a large camping area that lasts for several hundred meters. Keep walking through it and up to the top. Again, I’m not encouraging that you go without a guide, but I did notice during the hike that it would be doable independently with relative ease. A few posts I saw online insisted that doing the hike in one day would be impossible or incredibly difficult. I disagree. This hike was only moderately difficult (by my standards – everyone is different) and at about 12km roundtrip, which is totally doable if you leave early enough in the morning. I started at 7am and finished at 4pm, including plenty of time at the top and lots of photo stops. The beginning and the end are steep, with a bit of rock scrambling at the top. I imagine shortly after it rains the trail is muddy and difficult. However I found it to be pretty manageable just in running shoes. One big benefit of doing it in one day is the possibility of having the top to yourself. I passed what must have been at least 70 people coming down as I was going up, since most people don’t do it in one day. The sunrise and sunset are undoubtedly incredible, but also crowded, so unfortunately, you will miss that doing it in one day only. Unless you hike in with the stars, which I suppose is possible. Though you can leave Chiang Mai in the very early morning — like while it’s still dark out — to make it up to the trailhead, I suggest booking a couple of nights in Chiang Dao. It’s a lovely little town and it’s nice to have a laid back and relaxed evening before and after the hike, should you choose to do it in one day. I stayed at Chiang Dao Story Camp and thought it was lovely. Also, bundle up! It gets cold up there, especially if you camp overnight at the top. Additionally, if you can make this part of a bigger road trip, do! There are so many amazing things in the areas surrounding Chiang Mai, much of which are unknown to other tourists, which to me, makes them all the more special. Doi Luang Chiang Dao was a highlight of the north for me, and a lovely hike that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope that you do, too! Hiking is my passion. You do you train to be fit for hikes like these? I do hikes in the Netherlands, but they are mostly flat. How can I prepare for hiking up mountains? This mountain was the second I’ve ever tried. My first time, I decided to pick a small mountain that was going to take a few hours and was well populated in case I ran into trouble. I over prepared by bringing extra clothes, food and water and learned on the way what was actually neccessary.  I live in the prairies, so I’ve only done flat land hiking as well. I think the best thing you can do is pick a small one and go for it!  I didn’t overly train before I went but I did break in my new shoes on rougher terrain off the path and took advantage of going up any hill or stairs I came across. I think it helped. Glad you made it here! This was my favorite hike in Thailand, we saw the best sunset and sunrise, and saw mountain goats too. No way! Goats? Hi, How did you get your permit without a guide ? How do they enforce this ? We like to do trail running, so I don’t think guides are running. They don’t really enforce it and I didn’t have a permit TBH. I just went here November 2018. They now have guards posted at multiple stations along the hike. You do need a guide!!  They don’t send you back down, they arrest you. This is relatively new as it was explained to us. The guards are there 24/7 and camp on the mountain.   Our guides name was Coco, I bet if you asked he’d run up the mountain with you. He was a fantastic guide, and very knowledgeable. He also had a hotel near by so you can sleep then head right out to your hike.  We found him by asking the man at the bus station in doi Chiang Dao national park. Ash is absolutely correct, me and my girlfriend did the hike November 2018 and ended up getting arrested. We followed the directions for the trailhead that we found through this blog and at about 3/4 of the way up the mountain there were two guards stationed there. One was holding a machete. They told us to go back down, so no arguments on our end lol. At the bottom there were 5 park rangers waiting for us. They drove us to the police station, and made us take a video apologizing to the rangers and then let us go. Worst day in Thailand by far lol. And that trailhead thats described in this blog is no longer used and the trail has overgrown and is difficult to follow. We’re not exactly sure where the  new trailhead is. So yeah, just get the guide. Hi!!Thank you for your awesome post! 🙂 we are looking to do this hike in November but dont really want a guide. If we start early around 7 am is it possible to get through main entramce without a guide?Thank you in advance! I’d start earlier if you can. Hi there, Thanks for the post. Very useful tips. I am going there for hiking in November and was wondering if any earlier notification of national park authorities is required beforehand? Any permits/pass? Would be grateful for your advice. Thanks in advance. You are supposed to have a permit, yes. Hi Kristin, Thanks for your reply.How can I Get the permit? Is it possible to arrange it via internet?  Do You know more details?Is there any map available to Get there wihout a guide? You have to go in person the day before to the office and get it. Were you are able to do this hike in a pair of sneakers or do you advise hiking boots? Sneakers. The beginning can be steep and muddy if it has rained so boots might be helpful. I think the biggest thing is shoes with tread. Hi there, First of all, great blog post on this! Love all the information. Truly grateful for it.I know you didn’t get a permit, but was wondering if you knew where to acquire one? Everywhere I’ve read tells me I should get one but doesn’t say where from. Thanks! There’s an office located elsewhere. Travelfish says, “the Wildlife Sanctuary office, where you register for treks and book guides and transport, is situated at the end of the lane leading past Chiang Dao Nest at the foot of the steps climbing up to Wat Tham Pla Plong” Can you share how much the permit cost? The Airbnb’s I’m booking said they could get me a permit and guide but I think are ripping me off. I honestly did not get a permit. I just showed up at sunrise and was able to hike in. Not possible without a tour guide. Just went to their office, they don’t issue permits anymore. It’s not supposed to be possible, no. Anybody wants to do the hike on Nov-14?Solo here Hi! We’re planning to do the hike on Nov 20th. Did you try and succeed? With or without guide? 🙂 We’re still trying to find out if we can do it without guide and if not how much we would have to pay. Nadia Hi, maybe you will still manage to read it: I went there today. The path was awful: extremly muddy and with so much bush you couldn’t see the way. I slipped multiple times, it wasn’t enjoyable at all. After 1,5h we decided to go back. As we finally managed to reach the parking lot, there were some rangers waiting for us! They were unhappy with us appearing from behind the board „no entry” and took as to the police station in Chiang Dao! It wasnt funny!! With us started also one couple, the rangers knew it and were waiting for them as well! We were told the only legal way to reach the peak is with the guide but it’s also possible to do it in one day. People, dont go there alone if you dont want get into trouble with the police. what are the police going to do?  they’re not taking you to court are they.  500 baht fine at worst and I’d refuse to pay that as well.  i’m not even sure if the park rangers have any authority to physically move you somewhere.  they can tell you to leave the park, sure, not take you to a police station. Just saying what happened to me. I didn’t have to pay anything, they were just taking 1000 pictures od us, I think they also made a short video of us apologizing and we had to sign something written in Thai (?!). We don’t know what it was, nobody could explain us. There’s not so much space for a discussion as people speak only very basic English. As for me: it was very unpleasant to be stoped by them, waiting, not knowing what they actually wanted from us. I wouldn’t do it again so I’m just sharing my experience, hoping it will spare others some trouble. Ooooh, I think it’s important to not sign anything in a language when you can’t understand it. Glad it didn’t end up worse for you. Hello. 🙂 Glad to have come across your blog. I’m looking for some hiking destinations in Thailand. Was there any river crossing in the trail? There was not 🙂 Hi, I booked accommodation at Chiang Dao Nest, a friend had told me there were alot of trails, I had intended on run/hiking minimum 20 km a day and now see we cant access the trails.  Is there any long distance trails near by?  Thanks! I have no idea actually. I just went with the intention of doing that one. You can’t get the permit and do it? I would ask at the nest for other options. Do you know of any guide tours that drive up early in the morning for stargazing? Most involve an overnight so you’d see the stars then! Thanks for this post! Did you take anti-malarial drugs while hiking in this area? I know you’re not a doctor, and I’m not holding you to medical advice. I’m just curious what you did as I plan my own trip. Thanks! I have never taken anti malarials in Southeast Asia. My wife and I went by the park headquarters yesterday morning to be told that all the trails are closed and that even with a guide you cannot climb the mountain. When I asked why and if and when it might reopen they laughed uncomfortably trying to determine which of the five of them would respond to us. Finally a woman stepped up to the challenge said said she couldn’t say Aw bummer. Thanks for the update. I wonder if extreme rain caused an issue. Does anybody know if this hike has been reopned? We are looking to go in April and do this with a guide in one day    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/emerald-lake-lampang-thailand/,Emerald Lake: A Cenote in Thailand?!,Thailand,"I remember a few years ago when I posted on Facebook that I was looking for off the beaten path places to see in Southeast Asia. One of my acquaintances remarked that if I really wanted to head off the beaten path, I’d need to, “get out of Southeast Asia.” I’d like to take this opportunity to say, to him and to all of the other nonbelievers: False! Behold, the Emerald Lake in Lampang, Thailand. Had you ever heard of it until now? I can’t take full credit for finding this gem. My team member, Ashley, had the brilliant idea to search for amazing hidden places to see in Thailand on Thailand’s Google, and ended up finding this. Google maps doesn’t even have it in English.  This lake, like the cenotes in Mexico, is a sinkhole in the jungle, full of crystal clear water and catfish. It’s considered to be holy by the locals who make offerings to it yearly. Though it’s popular with Thai tourists, you’re unlikely to see other foreigners there. Delightfully, the entrance was free as well, in contrast to 300 baht for Doi Inthanon and 200 baht for most of the national parks I visited on the road trip around Chiang Mai, which included this stop. Initially, my road trip buddies and I weren’t sure if it was worth the extra 3 hours of driving that we’d tack on by adding this lake to the itinerary. It’s located in the Ngao district of Lampang in Tham Pha National Park, accessible here down a narrow concrete and partially dirt road. I’m glad we made the choice to go. It was pretty amazing seeing a cenote on the other side of the world from Mexico, the only place I previously thought they existed. It’s located about 3 and a half hours east of Chiang Mai and over two hours from our previous (mindblowing) stop, Wat Chaloem. Initially we got a little lost on the way, as I came to find that sometimes Google Maps is a bit weird to follow in rural Thailand. To avoid that, stay on route 1013 instead of taking Google Maps’ proposed shortcut, and you’ll see signs with images of the Emerald Lake that will direct you the rest of the way. We’d rented a cheap Toyota with a tiny engine and were able to make it there, though on a muddy day after rain, I’d recommend a motorbike with tires that can handle mud or a pickup truck. Much of the road is just packed dirt and in places it’s a bit steep. Once you arrive at the parking lot, it’s a 100-meter, super short and easy walk to the lake. Since the lake is considered sacred, swimming, fishing, and feeding the fish are not allowed. As tempting as it is to go for a swim, especially since it’s so clear and refreshing-looking, resisting keeps it in its pristine state. Regardless, it’s an enchanting little stop and one that I never expected to see in Thailand. This was just one of many stops on an incredible road trip around Chiang Mai, and only whetted my appetite to see more of Thailand’s lesser-known provinces. This is a cool find, not only pretty, but I think it is neat to find a place that is popular with locals and has spiritual as well as natural value. Glad you were able to find it! I enjoyed your video a lot and it was great that you included your road buddies. It was fun to watch and you all seemed to be having a great, fun time even with the bumpy ride and the directions. Serendipity at its finest. Congrats to Ashley to finding this jewel. It is good in a way that it is off the beaten path to preserve it, keep in unspoiled.BTW, I looked up cenotes and found that there are some also in Australia, Canada, United States, Belize, Zimbabwe, and Dominican Republic. There are a lot of sinkholes in FL but only the one in Mineral Springs is considered a cenote (or at least one I found, hope this info is useful!). HOWEVER, none mention one in Thailand and such a holy spot, great find!!! Whoa no way! Zimbabwe too?! Neato. Looks like you discovered an amazing spot! I’ll have to look for this next time I’m in Thailand 🙂 I went to this spot on the 11 December, 2018 and it is now receiving the full Thai tourist makeover.  They are making a new road there, and the “hike” to the Emerald Lake is having a path made.  At the entrance of the “hike” they are erecting buildings for shops.  I’m glad I got there before they finished.Go NOW if you want to see it before the foot traffic becomes too much.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/wat-chaloem-phra-kiat/,Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat: Thailand’s Floating Pagodas,Thailand,"The first time I saw an image of the floating temples of Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat my mouth dropped in awe. I thought I was looking at a photo of Bhutan at first. How had this been in Thailand all along and yet I hadn’t seen it on Instagram, on Facebook, and all over other travel blogs? There was hardly any info about Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn Temple (what a mouthful!) in English online, though I did see a mind-blowingly awesome drone video by a Thai tourist on YouTube and from that, I was sold. It became my number one must-see for my return to Thailand and you guys, it did not disappoint. It was just as amazing in person as the photos had promised. These pagodas dotting the mountain peaks were each carried up piece by piece by a revered local monk and a team of nearly 50 workers just over a decade ago. The amount of love and sweat that went into making this work of art and devotion a reality is astounding, especially when seen in person. Want to see it for yourself? Here’s how: What probably keeps most farang (foreign tourists) away is the accessibility of Wat Chaloem in Lampang province. There aren’t buses that can take you there, and it’s a solid two and a half hour drive from Chiang Mai by car, or longer by motorbike. However it’s easy to navigate to, and once you get out of Chiang Mai, the drive is quite pleasant along a relaxed highway that winds through the jungle and trees. I rented a car to go there as part of a larger road trip around Chiang Mai and, though I previously would have thought that driving in Thailand would be crazy and terrifying, I found it to be easy and laid back. The car rental set me back about 1000 baht per day which, when you split it with others, isn’t bad. You can navigate to it here. Alternatively, you can bus into Chae hom or fly into Lampang and take a taxi from there. Though honestly, both will be more annoying and a lot more expensive than just driving yourself. Once you get to the entrance of the wat, you’ll need to buy a ticket for 200 baht, and a compulsory songthaew ticket for 80 baht per person. Once the truck is loaded up it takes you most of the way up the mountain until you reach a set of stairs to climb the remaining 500 meters up. The view along the way is gorgeous, but the most amazing part is, of course, at the top. Wat Chaloem might not be super popular with foreigners yet, but it is well loved by Thais, so plan on sharing it with a lot of other people if you go there on a weekend or during the middle of the day. Tickets officially start to go on sale at 7:30am and finish at 4:30pm, though you can stay up there until 6pm and when I showed up at 7:15am, they were happy to sell me a ticket and take me up a bit earlier. On holidays, it opens a half hour earlier and closes a half hour later. The morning is a fantastic time to go to see the mist still hanging in the village below, plus, you won’t have nearly as many people to share it with if you go early. There are also plenty of food stalls at the bottom if you want to grab breakfast after you go up. I didn’t find any places to stay online before heading out to Wat Chaloem which had me a little worried, but once I arrived I found it’s popular enough to warrant a local guesthouse with rooms for 500 baht each. You can find it here. Call 06-1997-6988‬ to check availability – the owner speaks some English. The guesthouse is about 15 minutes away from the wat, and it was a nice, clean place to stay. There’s also an open-air street food-style restaurant about 100 meters away serving up delicious food until approx 6:30pm, so it ticked all of my boxes.  This discovery, amongst the others I made during my northern Thailand road trip, made me fall in love with the Land of Smiles in a whole new way. The friendliness of the people who were heading up and saying hello as I walked down, the breathtaking scenery, and the peacefulness of this province all had me wishing I had at least another month, maybe two, in Thailand. It’s hard to get enough of a place with so many hidden gems. Wat Chaloem, I’m so glad that you exist. What a gorgeous view!  I’ve enjoyed reading your blog for a while now!  I love seeing posts about less common places to visit.  It’s great knowing that there are resources out there for alternatives to the tourist-packed attractions and popular cities.  I’m inspired to try traveling more adventurously on my upcoming year long trek around the world!  Thanks! Sounds like an amazing adventure! Yes, the hidden gems are definitely out there 🙂 wow!  this looks amazinggg. all of my travels are hiking themed and i’ve been contemplating thailand for a while, but wasn’t sure what options were available for a hiking-based thailand vacation.  i’ve been loving the recent mountain-y thailand content!!!  lots of inspiration.  thanks for being awesome 🙂 turns out there’s a lot up there! Love the theme “Secret Thailand”, very catchy. Really like the font for the captions in the video and varying the color from white to black where necessary. What an awesome improvement. The drone footage is amazing and I am in awe of those who built those pagodas and would want to meet that revered monk. Very scenic.  It is also neat to see the vegetation and canopy at that elevation, less tropical, more like the mid-latitudes, and still so green! I love how the climate and vegetation changes as you climb mountains. Thailand is starting to address pollution from burning vegetation for agriculture (“biomass burning” of sugar cane) so hopefully the visibility will be even more insanely greater in the near future (not talking about the mist in the valleys, that’s pretty)! You have succeeded in seeing Thailand in a new way at a different time of your life, congrats! Looking forward to seeing what new perspectives and hidden gems you find in Indonesia! By the way, Kristin, do you know what temperature it was up there in the early morning? It is neat to feel cold air in the tropics and good to know what to wear. Are they starting to deal with the burning season? that’s good news! It’s not underway yet, though. It’ll be hard to see anything once it is up north. I needed a fleece before the sun rose but not after.  Hi Kristin, would it be really easy to drive from Chiangmai? It would be my 1st trip there and I’m not sure of the roads there.. That’s what I did! Roads are fine it’s just getting used to the way traffic moves. Hi Kristen! What car rental agency did you use? I’m heading to Chiang Mai with some friends next week and we were contemplating renting a car since it seems easier than separate forms of accommodation! Enterprise I think! Plz come to pakistan Hi Kristin,This came up as we were planning our Thailand trip as well as we were researching and we knew we just had to go. We were looking up a bunch of ways to get there, but its the first time we’ve heard of someone driving. Did you need a special license to rent a car overseas?How did you navigate from ChiangMai to the temple – did you prepare a map of some kind beforehand?Was there some where to park at the temple?What did you think of the truck that took you up the mountain? You don’t need a special license to rent the car but if you get pulled over without an international license you’ll get a ticket. We didn’t ever get pulled over. I used Google maps, and there’s a parking lot, yes. The truck was fine – there’s no way around it! Hi Kristen,  How long would you say that would spend here? Is it an all day thing or just a couple hours? I will definitely be checking it out in June! I just spent the morning there and moved on. Hi Kristin, Love to read your blogs for a big while. I like you put the ‘packing list’ in most of the places you went. It really helps. Lampang is my home town. There are many interesting places to visit both historic and nature wonders, and cultures of course. Did you have a chance to visit the Chae Son National Park near by this Wat Chaloem Phrakiat? It is where the very cold waterfall and the very hot hot sping meet. Put each leg on each side of the stream is wonderful feeling. There is area for tourists to camp also. The breakfast is the half-boiled eggs from hot spring!! I also travel the world both hiking and normal travelling. I have a fb travelling page just do it for fun 55. My next hiking will be the K2 base camp in August.  If you have chance to visit Thailand again please let me know. Let’s explore Lampang in details!! Pol Hi Pol that’s so cool! No I didn’t get to visit that spot but I’d love to go back with a local! I found the people to be so friendly and welcoming there. it was a very special experience. Thanks to your blog post we are right now at the bottom of the temples eating our breakfast after an early climb. I can’t thank you enough for sharing your informations. They were super useful. Price is now 270 Baht all together. So it got even cheaper which is quite rare. 😉 Aw thank you so much for letting me know! So glad you had a good time! <3    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/going-back-to-thailand/,Going Back to Thailand After Five Years,Thailand,"I still remember the way it felt walking off the plane, leaving my trepidation in the seat, wading into the cacophony of sounds in the arrivals hall of Bangkok airport, weaving through the glass doors, and out into the soft morning sunlight. The air had an entirely different quality in Southeast Asia, comforting with its heavy sweetness, a rush of warmth like a sauna reaching out and enveloping my body, drawing me in. This was over five years ago, on September 27, 2012, when I flew to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport with a one way ticket to begin the journey that I’m still on today. I didn’t know back then that leaving a steady job, selling off almost everything, leaving a relationship and effectively demolishing bridges behind me would work out. Sometimes I’m like, what was I thinking and where did I get those balls of steel from? Yet in that moment, standing on the concrete outside of the airport while taxi horns blared and their drivers chattered about their great rates to the city, only 1000 baht, I knew it had been the right call. It felt so right to be there, like the part of me who had lived in Asia when I was 21 had remained there, patiently waiting for me to come back and pick up where we left off. It’s a beautiful feeling when you come to a place for the first time and yet it feels like you belong. There was a lightness with each step, like I was walking on clouds. It was like every baby I saw was smiling at me and life was giving me a high five. Good job champ, you made the right choice. And yeah, I got scammed right away and yeah, I made a lot of mistakes, and I embraced it, and I learned, and a few days later I was riding a bike through Angkor Wat more blissed out than I could ever remember being. I’d found my happy place and it was on the road. Do you ever wonder what it will be like to go back to a place that held so much meaning for you? Will it feel like everything has changed and it’s not the place it used to be, or will it feel like coming home again? I have this question in my mind now because after a hiatus of nearly four years, this January, it’s time to go back to Thailand. I found myself yearning for the sticky warmth of Southeast Asia, the steaming street food, the gorgeous beaches, the intricate temples, and the laid back vibe. As winter approaches in Berlin, why not go back to where it all started, in the land of smiles? But what will it be like this time? I’m not in my 20s anymore. I’m not as gung-ho about sharing a room with 5 drunk backpackers anymore (me previously being one of them – no judgement). But I don’t party like that anymore. My aims and desires have changed entirely. I’m still interested in spiritual travel and heading off the beaten path, and that’s still what I will be seeking. I still love meeting new people and I still enjoy going out, it’s just with a different aim and without the hangover now. I still want to keep my budget in check, but I want a little more comfort and luxury now and then too. Can I balance my desires with my wallet? Most of all I wonder, will everything be different? Will it in many ways still be the same? Can I really hold Thailand to high expectations of remaining unchanged when I’ve changed so much myself? I think the only reasonable thing to do here is to go into it without expectations, and to just let it be what it will be, just like meeting up with an ex you haven’t seen in years but never really let go of. In a perfect world, I’d do exactly that. But this is not a perfect world and I’m only human, after all. From January to April in Southeast Asia, I’ll be sharing what it’s like as a 30-something woman traveling solo who doesn’t want to do the party thing, stay in dorms, and stick to the banana pancake trail – not that there’s anything wrong with that, it’s just something I’ve outgrown. I know that plenty of you feel the same way. I want to know, and share, what it’s like going to a backpacker’s haven when you’re not a backpacker anymore, but still want a wonderful, and reasonably affordable, travel experience. It’s time to revisit the budget guides, the packing lists, the best places to go, the ideal activities, and the experience of going as a 31-year-old. If you want to follow along, it’ll be on YouTube and Instagram of course, but you can also subscribe to receive blog posts via email below.  I’m not the same girl and Southeast Asia is not the same place. I’ll keep repeating it to myself until I believe it. I’m prepared for the jamais vu. It’s an opportunity, I get to start anew. If you have any thoughts about traveling in your 30s or questions in particular that you’d like covered while I’m there, let me know in the comments!  I’m dog sitting in Chiang Mai all month – drop in if you’re around these parts! 🙂 I am! I fly into CM What a great opportunity for reflection! I’m 30 and only just started my solo travel adventures. I took short trips on and off through my 20s but never did the backpacker thing, for lots of reasons. Thailand is absolutely on my list, but I’m frankly turned off by the 20-something backpacker experience. Yet nearly everything you read about travel in Thailand and Southeast Asia is built around that idea! So, in short, I’m excited to read your take as you return. I hope it’s still a special place for you, even if it’s in a different way! I think it will be, and so much of the experience is how I approach it as well, and making sure that I put myself in situations where I can enjoy it and find new and exciting things. I’m actually really excited, and hopefully after you see the posts you’ll want to go too! I went to Thailand when I was 19 and finally just returned 10 years later with my husband a couple of weeks ago. I was a little worried that it wouldn’t live up to my memories, that he wouldn’t love it like I did, and that I’d feel old and out of place. But that Thai magic was still there in full form, and even as a 34 year old my husband loved it. The people still grin ear to ear and make you feel at home and the street food is still fabulous. We stayed in small hotels and only partied one night out of ten and I didn’t feel weird about it once. Enjoy your travels!! I can’t wait to see more posts on here. That’s so awesome! Thanks for sharing that, makes me feel excited. And I am sooo looking forward to the FOOD! That’s something I trust won’t have changed too much if at all 🙂 What a cool thing! You never really hear anything about Southeast Asia outside of the young drunk backpackers on the banana pancake trail, and I’m excited to read about what you find there as a more mature traveler. When I travel there myself i would love to have a mix of the typical tourist experiences as well as experiences that don’t necessarily involve buckets and the like I have traveled to the same country and even the same sites every 10 years or so and get something different out of it. One time it was the beaches that called me (when youngest), later times it was outdoors, and then finally the spirituality of the place (in my 30’s). Some countries or areas seem to call you back to experience them for the first time again.I hope your first time again in Southeast Asia is a great continuation in your journey, different yet equally exciting. I think those in their 30’s and 40’s who travel know more of what they want, than their younger counterparts who are trying to figure it out, but either way brings its own joy as there is magic in spontaneity. I guarantee that you will have a great time in this wonderful place that not only welcomed you into your new path in life, but also will embrace you as a veteran and help you see how much you have grown, how much you have changed like what you want out of travel now versus before…and what you have still yet to learn as we always are learning more about ourselves. Looking forward to your posts and videos on this as we learn along with you! One thing you have in your repertoire these days is your further advanced skill with videos/photography. Do they allow drones over there? Best wishes and happy eating! They do allow drones, I think. I’m looking forward to experiencing it again! In my experience they wouldn’t allow drones without a permit at any of the major tourist spots (Angkor Wat, Ko Phi Phi, etc), but we flew ours in by the Kulen waterfall in Cambodia and all over Ko Lanta with no issues. My husband did a lot of research beforehand and actually filled out the paperwork and got insurance, but he never needed it. Our consensus was that if you use common sense no one will bother you 🙂 My partner and I spent 5 months in Thailand on our 18 month backpack trip. We was 28 and are now 32 back in thialand after 4 years later. Still feels like home. The only problem is we have seen so much it’s hard to find things to do. However having been here 6 weeks and still in the same place we are now enjoying getting to really know ko Samui, we have our favourite restaurants, places to relax etc.  We want to explore new places but are finding it hard to leave :). Sometimes it’s totally fine to just be comfortable! I’m going to Southeast Asia at the end of February for 3 months. I’ll be 30 and it’ll be my first solo travel experience. I think it’s safe to say that I’m just a bit freaking terrified. Oh and I’ve never been to that part of the world either.  So, in short, I’ll be reading all of your posts as you go! I’m a bit concerned that I won’t be doing the backpacker thing in like the backpacker place. So I can’t wait to start following along with your trip. I’m hoping reading about your travels as a 30 year old in southeast asia will (hopefully) ease my nerves just a little. It’s such a great place for first-time travelers! It’s so easy and social. I just think that being social will require that I do things differently now. Instead of just hanging out at a hostel common room maybe that means going to a local gym or joining an activity like free diving (I want to get my license while in Indonesia!) and I’m Ok with putting in just a little more effort 🙂 I travelled all around thailand on my solo RTW trip in my early 30’s in 2005/6. Life happened and now i am a mum and wonder what it would be like to travel with my 10year old. Would it ruin my memories or?Have fun, you are still young ? 10 is such a cute age! I’d love to see it through the eyes of a child. It would be special in its own way I’m sure. I can’t tell you how much I love this post! I didn’t start traveling until I was 30, so there has always been a voice in the back of my head, whispering that I’m missing out on the whole “backpacker experience.” Sure, I’d love to try it out, but that’s not really who I am. Like you said, I’m not the same girl I was in my 20s. While I’m still trying to figure out my own travel dreams of visiting SEA, I can’t wait to read about your experiences in the coming months! I lovingly name that voice my ’16 year old ego,’ since she never seems to think I’m cool enough. That’s okay with me! Ohhhhh  i’m excited to hear about this because I around your age and  I think about the same thing ! Have fun Kristin!!!Thailand is like a second home to me (well not really – but its my favourite travel destination!)Ive been to thailand more times than i can count!But it will be difficult for you this time around – as you grow so do your tastes – i look forward to hearing more about what thailand is like for you this time around  x Hi Kristin! Such an awesome post… I was in Thailand on my first backpacking adventure when I was 25 and now I’m sat here doing research on going back at 31, now as a solo backpacker! I can’t wait to feel that warm air and I also feel that I don’t have the same BP goals as before 🙂 I can’t wait to read about the adventure x Have so much fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/africa-packing-list/,"An Easy, Fashionable Africa Packing List",Tanzania,"“What in the world do people pack when they go to Africa? Where do I start? What is essential and what should I leave behind?” This was my question before I went to Africa for the first time, heading to South Africa with a backpack full of denim shorts and tank tops, kind of clueless about what was and wasn’t cool to wear there. It turned out that in most of Southern Africa, people dressed just like where I’m from in California – it’s all about fashion, feeling comfortable, and keeping it laid back. In Africa, you’ll see all kinds of interesting fashion decisions. I have to laugh to myself a little bit each time I travel there and see foreigners like me decked out head to toe in beige and olive green safari gear. They’ve got the vests, the hats, and the pants that zip off at the knee. Honestly, what do they think they’re going to need that for? You’re not even allowed to get out of the safari vehicles when in the wildlife areas, because of, you know, lions, hippos, and buffalo. While you can most certainly make the safari chic work for you by opting for the more stylish and modern cousins of the original, it’s also totally fine to go for the same cute clothes you’d wear at home, while keeping a few general rules in mind:  Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Africa here: Also, if you’ll be traveling to Cape Town, leave a little room in your bag to do some shopping. The local designers there are talented and have access to super cool fabrics, and the exchange rate, at least right now, is in your favor if on the Euro, Dollar, and GBP. I got custom shoes and these adorable shorts for way less than I would have at home. Each time I travel to Africa, I tend to bring my Pacsafe 55L backpack with me. It’s lined with Exomesh which makes it slash-proof, the zippers lock, and it has RFID-blocking technology so that theives can’t ‘bump into’ me and scan my credit card and passport info. I also bring along a smaller cross-body purse and wallet that has space for multiple currencies. They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well. I make myself the least attractive target that way. I also lock up my belongings in my Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa. Sadly, it’s often pressure from local mobsters on the people working in the hotels, or desperation given how low the wages are in most of Africa. There are a few more absolute essentials that you should bring from home that you will struggle to find in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and major cities like Nairobi, Kigali, and Lusaka: If you’re camping, I highly recommend the following: Insurance, immunizations, and meds: Travel insurance is an important addition to this packing list because it keeps you covered in the worst case scenario, which is being flown to a country where you can get the proper care you need. I use World Nomads since their explorer option also covers adventurous activities like hiking and scuba diving. You might be surprised to find that in major cities in Africa, like Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi, and surely plenty of others, immunizations and anti-malarial pills are way cheaper and often don’t require a prescription. I always buy my anti-malarials on the ground (though it’s important to take them before you will be exposed, so plan ahead). Keep in mind, Africa is huge, and this list is meant for those traveling through the southern and eastern countries with some suggestions for the far north as well. If you’re just sticking to South Africa, modesty isn’t a big concern and staples like hair products and sunscreen are easy to replace, but as you head more north and east, expect things to get a lot more lean and basic and you may be shocked at how difficult it is to find things that are totally common back home. Plan ahead and you’ll have a blast! Enjoy the beautiful adventure in comfort and style, and not in head-to-toe beige safari gear! *Some of these links are affiliate links and BMTM sponsors. Anything you purchase helps to support this site at absolutely no additional cost to you. Much love!  Everything on this list is SO cute. I’m so not with it when it comes to packing right. haha. I ALWAYS pack 50% OK stuff and the other half is “wtf was I thinking.” I’m getting better though! I really like to safari shorts for anytime actually! And all the unicorn things… I need unicorn things! haha. I wish I was a hat person but my hair is too big. lol. Thanks for this info, Kristin! I used to pack pretty badly too but I’m getting a lot better now. Lots of trial and error! I love hats because that African sun is intense! Hi Kristin,Thanks as always for the amazing posts.Did you use the same Ariat hiking boots in Kyrgystan?Thank you! I did not, I used another pair I have from Quechua and they’re not as nice. Lesson learned. Hi Kristin,Saw this post and guess what, I’m currently in Cape Town and want to do a little shopping? Where would you recommend? I found some awesome boutiques with stuff made by local designers on Long Street and in Woodstock. Check out the Neighbourhood Goods Market on Saturdays too. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I’m planning to spend some time in east Africa alone next year – an overland trek, some time in Kigali and maybe Tanzania and a couple of days in Nairobi. This is the part I’m worried about. I’d like to go to the David Sheldrick wildlife trust and maybe a few other places and I want to stay somewhere inexpensive. Are hostels a safe place to stay in Nairobi for a single woman traveler? I think you mentioned them but they sound a bit sketchy….probably the stereotypical Nairobi fear that you spoke of. Where do you stay in Nairobi if just for a few days.Thank you,Gina I haven’t actually been to Nairobi but have been to other big cities in the area like Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha, Kigali, and Kampala. I would just only walk during the day, and take cabs longer distances or at night. Ask at your hostel where is safe to go and where isn’t. Most hostels are locked with guards and plenty of other travelers, so I’ve felt OK in them. Have fun! Hi. I’m planning on a three months trip whatever I have time for of Malawi, Mosambik, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. I consider going alone as a female 27 years old and will use my experience of solo travels through south east asia and tanzania with a girl friend of mine. I want to travel with hand luggage, but I guess that is not a good idea if I will have to cary a bunch of sun screen to some places!? I am typical scandinavian with light skin and blonde hair. Also I wonder what is the easiest way to get from country to country? Where should I begin my trip? Thank you 🙂 Sunscreen is a good idea, especially since it’s hard to find once you reach East Africa, apart from in big cities. You could just bring several small bottles. As much as I hate suggesting so many small plastic items, it’ll help you go carry on only. It makes sense to fly into South Africa and go through Namibia to Botswana and work your way up and east. Local buses really suck, but they work. You can also sometimes take trains and long distance buses, or join an overland tour. This packing list is helpful. I am off for Cape Town in April. Thanks Have fun! What did you pack for an adapter so you could use hair tools?  I would like to bring a curling iron or straightener but most adapters I see say not to use hair tools with them! I don’t own any curling irons or straighteners! Sorry I can’t help more. HI Kristin thank you for writing everything in detail. I checked overland tours from Kenya to Tanzania nd they are super expensive, starting g from 1500 USD. Flight is even more expensive. I am travelinging solo, what will be the best way to travel between Zanzibar, Tanzania and Kenya? Not sure how many days that is but if you’re solo that might be the best way to go – something like an Acacia Africa or G adventures is the cheapest. Otherwise you can do public transport but I have to warn you it’s rough in that part of the world. Overcrowded vans with bald tires and massive delays constantly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tanzania-itinerary/,An Awesome Tanzania Itinerary,Tanzania,"When you picture that perfectly red African sun rising up over the horizon, over the giraffes roaming the savannah, the lions surveying their kingdom, and the elephants playing in the water, your mind’s eye could very well be creating a scene from Tanzania. If you want turquoise blue water, if you want to climb the highest mountains in Africa, and if you want to see the most ferocious and colorful beasts of the continent, Tanzania is the place. This country really does have it all for adventurers who want a real taste of Africa. So don your safari hat and grab your binoculars! This itinerary focuses on what’s known as the ‘northern circuit’ with a few randoms that I enjoy thrown in. Most of the famous must-sees are in the northern part of the country, though the south has some fantastic national parks and areas that are also worth exploring. With that in mind, here’s my ideal Tanzania itinerary which would take about two weeks, give or take: Zanzibar is probably a name you’ve heard before, synonymous with white sand beaches and bright blue water. It’s not just fancy editing used on the photos, guys, it really looks like that! You could spend weeks on Zanzibar alone, enjoying spice tours and the culture of Stone Town to the beaches elsewhere on the island. The diving there is great, as is the snorkeling, the little islands you can visit, the seafood, and wealth of activities. It’s also a tourist favorite, so don’t expect to get any beaches to yourself or to find bargain basement prices, though that goes for all of Tanzania. Click here to read more about Zanzibar and to book Zanzibar hotels In contrast to Zanzibar, Ushongo Beach near Pangani on the mainland coast is idyllic and quiet. You’re unlikely to run into many other tourists there or even touts on the beach. The water is still warmer than bath water and if you really just want some peace and an untouched beach, this is it. There’s still plenty to do, from kayaking down the coastline and into the mangroves to hiring a boat to go to the sandbar that only appears during low tide and snorkeling. I spent 4 days there and loved them all, and think that’s a good amount of time to chill out before continuing on your journey. Click here for more on Ushongo Beach, including tips on where to stay and how to get there. Head away from the coast and up to the mountains for some cooler weather and a peek at one of Tanzania’s most incredible views. Lushoto is mostly farmland with a few national parks thrown in. Guided walks to the waterfalls and through the parks are available – as in most of East Africa, you can’t go without a guide, as it’s a way to create local jobs. I found that the people were incredibly friendly in Lushoto, always saying “karibu” (welcome) as I walked by. The children were adorable too, running out of their huts to say hello. Best of all, the Irente viewpoint truly is incredible, providing views of all of the surroundings. On a clear day, for just $1, you can walk to the viewpoint and see for miles and miles. This is a great place to stop to break up the drive between the coast and the inland attractions like the Serengeti and Kilimanjaro. How long you’ll want to stay depends on how much hiking you want to do in the national parks. For me, this was just a two-night pit stop. Click here for tips on seeing the viewpoint and where to stay. Moshi is the base for Mount Kilimanjaro, one of the most famous climbs in Africa and the tallest mountain on the continent at 5,895 meters (19,341 feet). It’s a very popular climb, with treks ranging from 6-8+ days over several routes departing regularly from Moshi. You must take a guided hike, and you must be ready for some serious altitude! There are other hikes in the area too, like Mount Meru which is slightly lower than Kili (but still the fifth highest mountain in Africa at over 4,500 meters) that is only 70km away. If you have the time and the desire, both are reported to be amazing hikes. I haven’t hiked either one myself, though I’m an avid hiker. Time wasn’t on my side this time around but I’m heading back in January to climb both! Even if you don’t plan on climbing, the drive is long from Lushoto to Arusha, the jumping off point for the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater, so it’s worth a stop to sample the local coffee and take in the views of Kilimanjaro from below. The Ngorongoro Crater is one of the most beautiful places for safari that I’ve ever seen. Even though the Serengeti can often be dry and yellow, the crater experiences a good amount of moisture and jungle-like flora all around the rim where clouds collect, resulting in a greener and more lush caldera. This is the place to see black rhinos on your trip, particularly if you follow a few specific tips, like going super early and getting the right guide, to get better chances of seeing them and the other animals in the crater. Click here for my best suggestions for your crater experience.  While the Ngorongoro crater may be small, and doable in a day, the Serengeti National Park is absolutely humongous and to do it justice, give it at least 2-3 days of game drives for a chance to see leopards, lions, cheetahs, plenty of buffalo and elephants, and during the right time of year (February to March), the wildebeest migration. You’ll see all of the other usual suspects too, like hippos, giraffes, zebras, and warthogs, just to name a few. The zones surrounding the park are also full of wildlife, and have some amazing places to stay as well. Click here for information plus a discount on the safari that I did through the Serengeti. If you’re into birds and elephants, the Tarangire National Park is another great spot for wildlife viewing. Pictured above, I’m hanging out at the Simba Lodge in Tarangire which skirts the park and provides beautiful views to the wildlife and the Lake Manyara National Park is a good stop before or after the Serengeti and the crater. It’s home to a dense jungle and an alkaline lake that is famous for its flamingoes. The park is also known for leopard, lion, and cheetah sightings. This is also an area inhabited by Maasai people, a formerly nomadic tribe of people who herd cows in the region, and are also often employed as the guards for many lodges thanks to their fearless nature. A few things to consider:   Whether you’re all about some of the most famous beaches in East Africa, one of the biggest wildlife areas for animal sightings, climbing Africa’s tallest mountains, or having a unique cultural experience, Tanzania has almost every extreme. With a few weeks in the country, you can see the best of it, encompassing leisure and exciting animal sightings. Thank you for this itinerary, I would love to visit Tanzania someday and there’s not too much info about where to go on the web! This is the Africa everyone pictures as kids when they learn about what safaris are. This actually sounds like a great place to take kids on a trip. I love how varied the attractions you listed are, there’s kind of something for everyone. Totally! It’s like the Lion King! I saw some kids there and they seemed like they were having a blast. This is definitely going to be book marked – Tanzania is one of my dreams. Tanzania and Africa, in general, are one of my biggest dreams. Climbing Kilimanjaro? Yes, please. This itinerary seems great and you’ve made it very informative too. Can’t wait to visit Tanzania. Hope it would be soon! wow, looks like that you have a great adventure there, and wonderful pics by the way Look forward to when you get to climb Kilimanjaro. I am sure you will as always provide a great story and pictures. Did you hear of the recent climb by an 8 year old girl with her family who never camped out before and the little girl had open heart surgery at age 1? What a story! What is neat about it too is that contains the last remaining glacier in Africa but it is supposedly fading fast so I definitely want to climb it before or if that happens! Dang, I’ll think of her when I get tired! amazing Hey, Looks amazing! Could you tell me how much does this trip cost approximately? It’ll depend on how many people you share it with! Since they do this by the vehicle the best case scenario is sharing it with a group of 6 or so friends. I’d also suggest contacting them directly to see if they have any options to join an existing group. If you’re solo and on a budget trips like Acacia or G Adventures are good too! That’s a very complete and beautiful itinerary ! And the pictures are lovely… great source of inspiration for the next trips ! Hi Kristin, I really enjoyed reading your various posts about Tanzania in order to plan our trip in July! I noticed you mentioned you were self-driving but rented drivers + cars for the time spent in the crater and Serengeti. Did you arrange these drivers directly from Tanzania or beforehand? Also did you do the whole route Arusha to coast (or reverse) by 4WD? Thanks so much for sharing your experience So I joined a couple who bought a 4WD but I believe you could rent. The Serengeti has super rough roads so it’s best to go with a tour company which I would book through your accommodation before you arrive. Hey! You mention in your Tanzania guide that there are campsites all across the country, though I’ve been unable to find many places listed. Do you happen to have the names of any of the places here that have camping options? Yes you can check the names of where G adventures and Acacia Africa stop for the night because they’re both camping safaris and as things change they tend to pick the best ones.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/flash-flood-africa/,The Night a Flash Flood Almost Carried Me Away in Africa,Tanzania,"The following is from a note I typed into my phone on the night of February 26 while the rain fell outside my room in Arusha, Tanzania. I was panicked and couldn’t sleep, so I did what I always do when I’m scared or in pain. I wrote it all down: I felt my tent shaking and the Maasai camp guard I’d said ‘jambo’ to 15 minutes before yelling something about water. It had been raining intensely. No, that’s not enough to describe it. It monsooned, it was cartoonish, it was Biblical. I’d put my tent on a raised concrete picnic area with a tin roof. Though the storm was at a percussion level I’d only ever experienced once or twice before (also in Africa), I figured that where I was had to be the best possible position. “I know it’s raining, but I’m covered, I’m fine!” I relayed from within my tent. But he was insistent, and panicked, shouting about water again, so I unzipped the tent and got out. He began pulling it out of the shelter and uphill furiously. “What the hell?” I exclaimed, angry at first, until some lightning lit up the ground and I finally understood. The water was rising, then encircling me as he pulled my tent away, and then before I knew it I was on an island, clutching my journal and this phone I’m typing on, my pillow, and for some reason, my water bottle (who cares about a water bottle?!) I jumped into the thigh-deep water and charged to higher ground, running to the others (A couple of other travel bloggers who I’m currently driving through Africa with) to tell them they had to come immediately. The flood started to surround the truck. I don’t know what we were thinking, but we somehow trusted that it would not get any higher, and ran back for the truck to grab our electronics from the seats they were resting on while the water ran up around our chests. I shuddered when I realized it had rushed up and over where I was in my tent. The little picnic area wasn’t even visible anymore. We ran back to higher ground with no choice but to watch in horror. Would the truck float away? The river near the campsite had overflowed. Apparently a tree had fallen into it and got caught on a bridge. Ma, the owner of the campsite, calmly came over with an umbrella, some keys, and some T-shirts and offered us a room for the night so that we could be dry and warm. It’s where I’m sitting now, several hours later. I hear whistling and shouting outside and engines somewhere in the distance. I don’t know what to make of it but the river has two sides, and I have no idea what’s on the other. Are people ok? Are they looking for each other? Am I overreacting or just not yet grasping how severe this is? Can I take my eyes off of the ground outside for a moment? Is that ok to do? Then I wonder for a moment how close I was to getting trapped in my tent, engulfed in mud. Did that warrior save my life? Was it that dire? I wouldn’t have known until the water was infiltrating my tent. Within seconds, it would have been well up over my head. I’ll never know, but I do know that it was only the two of us down there, and that he could have just as easily ran but he risked his life too and warned me. There was no way to know then how fast and high the water would rise. Is this part of the story? It must be. Just like every traumatic event, I wonder if it is the catalyst, one that will only make sense later. But there is one thing for sure, right now I just wish it would not rain anymore. Please stop with those thumb tacks falling on the tin ceiling. We’ve had enough. Tomorrow will be telling. Will the truck start? Is it just a goner now? Is the end of the road here? Is the warrior still watching, in case it happens again? After that, I watched the rain for a few more hours before passing out. When the birds started chirping in the morning I awoke with a start. I was okay, and all of my stuff was okay, but was the car done for? I walked outside to survey the damage. It was mud-topia. Seriously, if the circumstances had been different, and there weren’t rocks and acacia thorns and perhaps the odd fork or knife from the picnic areas lodged in it, we could have all had one epic mud fight. The real hero of the story are Ma and BJ of the snake park, who gave us a room the moment they realized what had happened, gave us T-shirts so that we’d have dry clothes to wear, fed us breakfast and dinner, and fixed the car in their mechanic shop on site, all for free, and all with a smile even though they were suffering too. After all, they were watching their home flood. Native South Africans, Ma, Deon, and BJ moved up from South Africa in the early ’90s, bought a plot of land with nothing on it, planted trees and flowers, and adopted reptiles, which is a family passion. They have vipers, spitting cobras, crocodiles, and the famously venomous black mamba onsite. They also have the only anti-venom clinic in the area, and offer free care for snake bite and burn victims. They’ve also got camels, a Maasai cultural center, an orphanage, and a full mechanic shop onsite. If you’re going to get caught in a flood, I suppose the snake park is the best place where it could happen. Over the next couple of days that felt stuck in time, I hung in my hammock, talked to another camper there and enjoyed the chance to get to know someone new, looked around at all of the beautiful flowers and trees they had planted, and all of the birds that it attracted, and allowed myself to really see and appreciate it all. I’m thankful to have met people with such big hearts, and though this might sound crazy, I feel lucky for the experience. I feel lucky that the Maasai guard was watching that night, that the flood wasn’t any faster or higher, and that the adventure, at least for now, continues. And I’m reminded that life is short, which is something I knew already, but didn’t think about nearly enough. Hi Kristin:Thank goodness you, Natasha and Cameron (and any other campers) came out of it okay and the Maasai camp guard was a true hero (may have saved 3 lives that night!) along with Ma and BJ. Things happen and to survive and experience such love and compassion from those around you is certainly special. Everything just seems so special afterwards. I wouldn’t be surprised if this area floods every year based on the Maasai’s recognition of the impending flood.  When it rains, often the big storms don’t move anywhere until raining itself out and the clouds in the tropics get so high up in the atmosphere, you get lots of ice crystals (cloud tops in tropics colder than midlatitudes or poles!) making for incredible and loud “light shows”. I wonder if the remnants of Tropical Cyclone Dineo, down in Zimbabwe may have enhanced moisture further north in Tanzania (maybe not, 1000 miles away). Meteorology is one of my backgrounds. This blog is a great opportunity to make people aware of the dangers of flash flooding. Not many people know for instance that the leading cause of death and injury from tropical storms is not the wind, tornadoes, coastal flooding, storm surge, but inland flooding. In fact, in Tanzania flooding is rated as the worst natural disaster. It is not uncommon in the United States (so may even be worse in Africa in the tropical areas) for river levels to rise rapidly by 20 feet during a rainstorm like you had. You mentioned being from California, so you can attest to this with the winter California has had (made for incredible snow amounts in the Western mountains though as shown in your earlier pics  and they need the water!!). For what it is worth, when you have access to internet sources, this is a great site for forecasting possible potential for flooding/droughts:http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/international/africa/africa.shtml And it is interesting how La Nina and other abnormalities in the weather pattern can blunt the “little dry season” as it did in 2016 (Arusha is mentioned near the bottom)http://floodlist.com/africa/floods-january-february-2016-tanzania I hope this information is useful to you. Just to let you know, I was nearly trapped by flooding in my car (so many people don’t follow the don’t drown, turn around rule) trying to get to a monitoring site for work. It rained 24 inches in 36 hours in Austell, GA, a 1 in 500 year event, but I was not free of blame for getting into trouble because I knew there was rain coming, but I wanted to get the data and had never experienced such a thing first hand. Not only have you taken a potential traumatic event, and turned into a great story about people with big hearts, gratefulness for what you have, a bonding experience with fellow campers, but maybe also into a learning experience for everyone reading your blogs. May people emulate your positive outlook, as life isn’t about getting everything you want, control, and knowing what is around the corner, but how you deal with what comes at you.

Best wishes, GG I had no idea how dangerous it was up until recently. I recalled a flash flood had taken place a couple of months before in California and carried away some cars and campers, and I’d been scared of it when camping nearby that same weekend, only to have it happen to me a few weeks later! Crazy stuff. What an intense experience! I felt the same when locals were warning me about a flood coming in Thailand. I didn’t want to listen but so happy I did! Luckily I got on the LAST seat of the LAST bus leaving town bc at 5am that next morning everyone was flooded in and on their roofs waiting for the rescue boats.It’s crazy you actually had a view of what could have been. I get it when you say you’re lucky for the experience. I think we sometimes need these to bring us back down to reality and to realize we are actually living life, bc it is VERY short! Wow where and when was that?? Good thing you had lots of warning! So often people don’t.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/ngorongoro-crater-guide/,7 Tips for a Better Ngorongoro Crater Experience,Tanzania,"The Ngorongoro Crater was so-named by the Maasai people, the original inhabitants, to mean the gift of life. It’s so lush and green, with jungles along the crater rim and green grasses in an otherwise savannah-like Rift Valley, it’s no surprise they chose this name. The crater is the world’s largest inactive, intact, and unfilled volcanic caldera, and was named of one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa. Approximately 25,000 animals live in the crater, and it is one of the best places in Tanzania to see the critically endangered black rhino. On a personal level, after going on Safari in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia, I have to say this is one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever searched for wildlife, and other than Etosha in Namibia, the only place where I’ve seen wild black rhinos. I saw four, to be exact. The crater is also home to one of the the densest known population of Masai lions, which I saw as well, playing in the grass. This was due to a combination of being lucky and doing a few key things right – though mostly the latter. These are my tips for seeing the best of the best in the Ngorongoro Crater: If you’re planning out a Tanzania trip and want to see the Serengeti too (and you should!) and are wondering where to prioritize your time, compare the size of the two. The crater is pretty small at 8,292 km2 (3,202 sq mi), and there aren’t a lot of places to hide, so the animals are everywhere, in plain sight. In almost any direction you look, you’ll see zebra, wildebeest, elephants, and if you’re lucky, lions and rhinos too. You can devote one full day to the crater, and save 2-3, or more, for some of the other parks which are much larger and have different animals, like giraffe and leopards. I suggest arriving at your lodging on the crater rim by the mid afternoon. This gives you a chance to watch as golden hour and then sunset come and paint the crater various hues of green and blue. It’s a beautiful sight. There are campsites and hotels of varying luxury. I stayed at the Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge which is within the Crater Conservancy and provides breathtaking views from the stone rooms and pictured here, from the bar and dinner area: The food was good and plentiful, they hire local Maasai to come dance in the evenings, which I like since they provide work opportunities for the local community, and rooms start from the low $200s per night, which is a pretty decent rate for the crater! We left the hotel at 5:55am for our game drive into the Ngorongoro Crater, and it was the best decision we could have made! Later in the day three things happen: The animals get lazy and tired and try to hide from the heat, more and more cars arrive so the crater gets crowded, and the light gets quite harsh for photos. We got lucky with lion sightings, seeing the younger lions playing around in the reeds and the water. Later in the day, they were considerably less animated, sleeping under rocks and in the ravines, enjoying the shade. We were also lucky enough to see four black rhinos. Two were at a distance, but the other two we saw were pretty close! We booked our guide, Francis with African Horizons, as well as our hotel and car through Perfect Africa, which organizes tours all over Africa. Francis was essential to our trip because he knows how to spot the animals. It was also at his suggestion that we went super early in the morning. He took this very seriously, making sure that we were the very first people in the gate. He also had a radio that allowed him to communicate with the other drivers so that if they spotted something, he would know where to go. It was usually him letting everyone else know what we’d found, though, because we had been the first in the crater and he’s so great at his job. Ask for him when you book with Perfect Africa and you won’t be disappointed! Like the Serengeti, you can self-drive the crater if you really want to. You’re looking at a $300 vehicle fee (if it’s foreign-registered like the one we’re driving is) plus the $70 per person park fees for the privilege, though. I’m normally not a tour person, but the downside to doing the crater on your own is you don’t have the pop-up top that allows you to stand and get a 360-degree view of the crater and animals, so you’re fighting each other for window space. We’d read in forums that the roads are also terrible, which I can confirm are incredibly true. They might be among the worst in Tanzania, which is honestly quite a feat since many of the roads are barely even roads, so you’ll spend more time worrying about the car than enjoying what you’re seeing if you self-drive. Let your guide know what you want to see the most so that he knows what to prioritize when you enter the crater. We wanted to see rhinos, so he made that priority number one from the get-go. He also knew that we really wanted to see hyenas, because for whatever inconceivable reason they just appear to be really cute to me. I know one shouldn’t and can’t hug a hyena, but how can someone with a face like this really be a villain in the Lion King, I ask you? He was so knowledgable about the area and the animals as well, and he even brought along his own camera with a 300mm zoom lens so that we could shoot with it in case ours broke or weren’t long enough. He had a pair of binoculars as well, which we were really excited to have along for the rhinos. There are designated picnic areas where you can go and have your breakfast and lunch, sometimes with a little plaid table cloth over the hood of the car, if you fancy, but we had an even better breakfast view. We stayed in the car and ate our packed breakfast while watching the rhinos. I can honestly say that’s the coolest breakfast view I’ve ever had! Another incentive for eating in the car is the aggressive birds. Every now and then, they make off with some of the tourist’s food and some are even brazen enough to grab your food right out of your hands! These are huge birds, and you don’t want those talons to meet your face. I much preferred watching a rhino and all kinds of awesome hoofed animals from the car instead. In all, we spent rougly 24 hours between the crater rim and the crater itself, arriving in the afternoon, enjoying an evening on the rim watching the stars come out, and descending into the crater early in the morning to see the best that it had to offer. It all came down to timing, having an awesome guide, and yes, there was a little bit of luck involved too. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Perfect Africa, all thoughts on the safari and the awesome rhinos are sincere and my own, as always.  Amazing!!!! I love it and I like so much the pictures! Just one question: what abput the mosquito there? I´m thinking to travel this year but not sure if I will need some protection I didn’t get many bites at all in Tanzania. This is partially because they are experiencing a drought. It also depends on the season. Typically during the rainy season you can expect mozzies. So if you’re really on a budget or short on time, Nrogongoro Crater would be a good place to see a lot of animals in one place? It would be ideal to visit both here and the big parks though, just cause why not, you’d already be in Tanzania. Tanzania sounds frickin awesome, I never had it on my bucket list before but now it’s jumped right up there near the top. Well, it’s still expensive to visit, but I agree with you that if you’re in Tanzania how could you not? HI Kristin-My Daughter and I will be in Tanzania 2/19-3/19. We want to climb Kili and then do safari as well as some culturally stimulating visits. ALot of the tours want to get us in and out of Tanzania within 2 Weeks!What kind of relaxed itinerary do you suggest that we follow? WE will climb first. Do you have suggestions following the climb?Do you know of a good guide/driver to hire for after our climb? Hi Lee, the company linked in this post was fantastic, and if I went back I’d hire them again.  This is the itinerary I followed when I was there, which, if you hike Kili, would definitely take longer than two weeks: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tanzania-itinerary/ Hi Kristin,  My boyfriend and I are going to Tanzania this end of December and our budget is kinda tight.I’m interested in you what you mentioned that you booked your guide, Francis, with African Horizons, and your hotel and car through Perfect Africa. I always thought that the safari companies typically just do all-in packages, meaning accommodation and food, tour guide, and vehicle are all from their company.  Do you mean that you can actually book them separately from different providers?  Would also be interested to know how much it came out per day in effect.   And last, coz we heard booking things just when you get to ARusha (instead of in advance) can make it cheaper.  Would you agree with this assessment?  Thanks a lot! Hi Tina, yes, safari companies usually book everything for you and they do so through subcontracting out the drivers, organizing the hotels, and activities as well. So African Horizons was organized through Perfect Africa. If you contact them and tell them your budget I’m sure they can put something together that would match your needs. Packages can go from budget to astronomical so it’s better to start with what you can afford and go from there. I’d personally book ahead of time, especially in high season. AMAZING!!! Your post is so on-point and your photos are unreal! (hearteyes) I can’t wait for our Ngorongoro trip!  Such a great post! I’m planning my trip now and starting to feel really overwhelmed! have fun! I’d just pick a tour operator that offers the level of service you’re seeking and let them do the planning. Will be going to Ngorongoro in Feb; Have a tight budge but would appreciate any info you may have to travel to Gombe NP;  It doesn’t seem to be an easy travel arrangement; TIA I took a driver and a local company. It’s not a super affordable part of the world, unfortunately.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-book-an-affordable-serengeti-safari/,How to Book an Amazing (and Affordable) Safari in The Serengeti,Tanzania,"Tell me, when you were a child learning the alphabet, wasn’t Q always for ‘queen’, and X was for ‘xylophone’? And what was Z for? Z was for ‘Zebra’, wasn’t it? Such was my conditioning as a child in suburban California, dreaming of animals in Africa for as long as my memories go back even though I was a half a world away. But my imagination lived in Africa, where E was for ‘elephant,’ …and L was for ‘lion’, In the Serengeti, a wonderland for safari holidays in Africa, you can see them all in just a few hours. They’re wild, free, and doing what animals do. You might catch them in a kill, running from point A to B, eating, swimming, or in the heat of the day – sleeping. There are giraffes taller and more intricately patterned than my imagination had previously allowed, and hippos that showed me that no, they’re not cuddly and cute, they’re ferocious and deadly. The leopards hang out in trees, oblivious of or maybe just ambivalent towards their fame, beauty, and popularity. There’s probably no way this hasn’t already crossed your mind, but yes Pumbaa from the Lion King is around as well, crawling around on his knees looking for grubs. That’s not all, though. The Serengeti is also home to 2 million wildebeests, 900,000 Thomson’s gazelles and 300,000 zebras as the dominant herds (via the Unesco World Heritage site). The Serengeti is also hosts many other herbivores including; “7,000 elands, 27,000 topis, 18,000 hartebeests, 70,000 buffalos, 4,000 giraffes, 15,000 warthogs, 3,000 waterbucks, 2,700 elephants, 500 hippopotamuses, 200 black rhinoceroses, 10 species of antelope and 10 species of primate.” That’s a boat load, no, more than a boat load, of animals! Indeed, the magic of the Serengeti is difficult to describe in words, which is why you see me reduced to referencing children’s movies and songs. The landscape of vast plains and a scattered outcropping of rocks (Kopjes ) here and there that was originally formed by volcanic activity is vast and diverse like few places on the planet.  When looking out at the Serengeti it’s easy to see why the Maasai, who are the native inhabitants, know it as ‘Siringitu’ –  the place where the land moves on forever.  The Serengeti region spans over 30,000 square kilometers and encompasses the Serengeti National Park itself, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Maswa Game Reserve, the Loliondo, Grumeti and Ikorongo Controlled Areas, as well as the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. The part I visited was the Serengeti National Park and some of the surrounding conservation areas, sleeping just outside the park at the Simba Serengeti Lodge which is a tented lodge with a killer view. In the  Serengeti, as with all of Tanzania, you can spend a metric ton of money on a safari, or you can go the extreme budget route taking a local bus and skirting the outsides without going in, or something in between. I opted for that something in between because I wasn’t about to go all the way to the Serengeti and not go in with a proper safari vehicle! While I’m a huge fan of doing things independently (I’m traveling through East Africa at the moment with a couple of others who are self-driving in their 4×4), we ditched the truck for this adventure for a few reasons: The roads are insanely bad in the Serengeti and we didn’t want to pop a tire, you really want a guide with you who knows how to spot animals, and the safari vehicles with the pop-up top are way better for viewing. Once we got there, we saw zero other self-drivers, thereby confirming we’d made the right choice. Most people book a package, including a full-board few nights at a lodge, a safari vehicle with a driver, and maybe even a bush flight into the park to save time, and to have a killer view: Safari packages can cost tens of thousands of dollars per person on the high end, closer to several hundred dollars per day in the mid-range (which is what Simba is, and what I did), and can be more like a day tour departing from Arusha if you’re on a tight budget but still want to enter the park. There’s no bush camping in the Serengeti, as it’s a National Park, but there are campsites with amenities. There are a few clever ways that you can spend less money during your trip, such as staying on the outskirts of the Serengeti in the conservation areas for some of the trip. The park fees cost just over $70 per person per day at the time of this writing, but the animals don’t know what is in the park and what isn’t, and you’ll find just as many animals in the conservation areas, and far fewer people. We took the truck out and saw a family of elephants crossing a river and then the road right in front of us, escorting their two-month-old baby along the way. Many of the lodges, such as the Simba Serengeti Lodge, are located on the outskirts, so you can still stay in the vicinity of the park, see animals from your room (I saw a giraffe!), and hang out in the pool in the hot afternoons, all enjoying the Serengeti without having to pay to be in it. In the conservation area, you can also get out of the vehicle (when it’s safe, of course), and do things like a bush breakfast. You can also book during the low season, which is right in the middle of the rainy season in April, or before the great migration begins in January and February. This is known as the green season in the Serengeti, when the dry and golden plains grasses turn more lush. As mentioned earlier in the post, there are several areas that make up the Serengeti and several other national parks nearby as well. The Ngorongoro Crater, for example, is famous for Black Rhino sightings and Lake Manyara National Park has beautiful flamingos. Tarangire National park also has plenty of wildlife, from monkeys to elephants and all kinds of species in between. Swimming in the pool just on the outskirts of the park, I saw a herd of male elephants walk by. Most of the time, when people come visit the Serengeti, they book safaris in these neighboring parks as well. Might as well if you’ve come all the way to Tanzania, right? All in all, I spent about 10 days in the Serengeti National Park, the crater, and the surrounding areas. Each day I saw something different and wonderful, including the big five: buffalo, lions, leopard, elephants, and rhinos. So if you’re going on a safari in the Serengeti and want to do it right with a mid-range budget, get a few of your friends, rent a big safari vehicle with a driver, and hop around a few of the lodges to see it all. I like Simba for this because the price is right, the food is really good and healthy, the service is great, the rooms are super clean and the beds are comfortable, they have outdoor showers (and I LOVE me an outdoor shower), and they all have pools and nice views. If you share the safari tented rooms, share the car, and enter the parks for one day each and spend the rest of the time on the outskirts, you’ll see plenty, spend less, and still be comfortable and happy with the experience. I definitely was! If  you want to do it the way that I did, Simba Portfolio Lodges is offering a 15% discount for BMTM readers! Just mention this post when you email info@simbalodges.com for a discount off the rack rate for the trip that I did (and I’ve looked into it, guys, their lodges and drivers are priced right). Happy adventuring. *This post was brought to you in partnership with Simba Portfolio Lodges, who I worked with to bring you this discount and awesome Serengeti content.  Thank you for this!! I’ve been trying to figure how to do Tanzania properly without handing over thousands of dollars to a tour company with mixed reviews. For those of us that won’t have a land cruiser waiting when we arrive, how would you recommended getting from a major airport to the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater? Are there reliable transportation companies around? You could fly into Arusha and get picked up there. If it’s not super expensive I’d probably do that. it’s a looooong bus ride from Dar es Salaam otherwise. Doable but not much fun. Thank you! I’m loving your Africa posts Awesome article. Going on a safari is totally on my bucket list 🙂 what made you decide to do a safari in Tanzania? There seems to be so many amazing places to choose from. I’ve gone on safaris in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia as well and those were all wonderful, but the Serengeti is so famous. They all have different things that you can see, so for me this was a bucket list item. Actually you can camp in the Serengeti – they have designated camp areas, with bathrooms and little buildings for cooking and eating. We went with “It started in Africa” which is very affordable and comes highly recommended. The guide and cook were absolutely smashing and i would go with them again in a heart beat. Also very competitive on price. Good to know! I meant you can’t bush camp, so you can’t go in and camp for free, but I’m sure there are all kinds of options once you’re in the park and in a designated area. You still needed a guide and cook. This was very helpful, and is definitely something I’ve always wanted to do!  Including the other places you’ve done, do you have a favorite?  Is it possible to do this kind of trip in those countries?  How much of this trip would one need to set up for themselves vs Simba Lodges?  And how many days would you recommend? I really liked the Serengeti and Chobe in Botswana the best, however I did not see cats or rhinos in Chobe. That’s on a river rather than in a vehicle so it’s different. I did 9 days but one week would totally work too if that’s what you have to work with, or even a few days less. Honestly having a vehicle is a must so I’d start there. I’d also book it all together, for ease and probably price as well. I’m a fan of doing things as independently as possible but Africa is just different with how difficult that can be. Also, how was the heat, since you were in a tent, which I’m assuming wasn’t air conditioned? The temperature for most of my time in Tanzania was comfortable during the day and they actually provide a heated water bottle at night because it gets a little bit chilly, but it was still tank top weather for me. This was super helpful! My husband and I are planning to go in January. However, its really hard to plan such a big trip without knowing the area. You mention “grabbing a group”  to share the guide and the truck but like I mention we are traveling alone. Is it common to meet people  there, Perhaps at  the Simba Lodge looking to share a guide? You could ask Simba lodge when you book if it’s possible to join another group. I wouldn’t plan on finding people there. How to you go about finding the drivers to hire? Is there a site or place to find them? I went with Perfect Africa for the Ngorongoro Crater and I really liked them, and Simba for the Serengeti. Hello, thank you for this!  I am planning a trip to Tanzania solo, and I love the idea of doing this how you did it.  Would you recommend first booking accommodations at the respective lodges, then finding an operator?  Do the lodges have any relationships with operators?  I, too, would be coming solo but interested to find a group – do the lodges or operators help facilitate groups coming together? Thank you again!  Your blog is wonderful for women traveling solo! The lodges and the operators do have relationships and they will book the hotels for you. Often they’re all owned by the same company. There may be ones that will look to pair you up with others. Otherwise you can try the Africa backpacking group on Facebook, or join an actual tour 🙂 Thank you for this absolutely wonderful blog post ! Pinned it already and going to look it up whenever I plan my trip to Tanzania.  Best,Rahul Kristin, There are “local busses” from which place to which place?Where you you rent a 4WD without driver?  Company name?Did you rent a guide who “knows how to spot animals”?  If yes, what operator? Thanks a lot, regards, I thought our guide with African Horizons was excellent http://www.africanhorizons.com/ Hi Kristin. Love your site and we just booked at Simba on your recommendation :). I wanted to ask any tips you might have on how long customs takes in Dar Es Salaam – we need to catch a FastJet to Mwanza after landing – and the best place to get a SIM card. I saw you mentioned Vodacom, but where to buy? Also, we could use recommendations about how to get to the Serengeti from Mwanza. Thanks!! There’s a tiny little stand outside the airport where you can buy a SIM. Ask around and people will point you in the right direction. It takes a bit of time to get the visa in your passport, and that will all depend on how many staff are working, how many people just landed, and if their systems are up and running. It’s a tough question to answer. I’d leave a generous time buffer if you can. I was in a private car my friends owned to travel around but you can also as Simba to organize transport for you! Hi Kristin, I’m a bit confused. So basically you didn’t use a tour operator and stayed in the Serengeti Simba Lodge the entire time? How did you get to the lodge? I would be landing in Kilimanjoro Airport from my international flight. Also, how did you do game drives? Who did you book that with? Thanks. Simba provides all of the game drives and transport as well. Hey! How much all up did it cost you for the 10 days? Did you see the migration? I’m trying to get pricing from Simba based on your recommendation here as it’s not on their website. To be totally transparent I didn’t pay for it. I wasn’t there in migration season. Hi Kristin, could you give some recommendations of reliable local companies i could book my safari with? (Which i can also find on tripadvisor) safaris are so expensive, until now i did not find a good one below 2500dollar for a 8day safari. Could you send me some concrete recommendations in order i can make it affordable? (I have already read above comments). I only did the one mentioned in this post so I can’t really recommend any others. You can always choose to camp instead and go with a G Adventures type of tour. Was the accommodations for Simba and the guide prebooked or did you book everything once you were already in Africa? I would prebook. Great Blog Kristin & some interesting points & tips.My wife & I have been looking into doing the Serengeti after doing a self drive around Kruger last year, & yes you can hire a 4×4, drive yourself around going from camp to camp as long as you’ve pre booked your accommodation. Yes it’s not as easy as Kruger to organise but we’re getting there slowly but surely, & not as cheap. We did 5 nights in Kruger with vehicle hire & accommodation for £385, not including flights as we were in Mozambique at the time & caught a bus over to South Africa.When we’ve finally organised it i’ll post some useful tips & contacts for others who wish to take this route to doing a safari. Where do suggest you go for your best chance at seeing Cheetahs while visiting Africa Namibia has a few reserves like Africat. I also have seen them in Etosha.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-to-pack-for-zanzibar/,5 Steps for Perfect Zanzibar Style,Tanzania," Life is so wonderfully funny. Kristin and I coincidently ended up in one of the world’s most spectacular destinations simultaneously – Tanzania – and have been sending emails back and forth professing our love for this spectacular destination. While she is deep in the heart of the Serengeti (this girl is wild), I embarked on a  yoga retreat in one of the most picturesque islands in the world: Zanzibar. And goodness, did it change everything… Experiencing African island life is a complete game-changer for the soul and yes, even the way you approach your every day style and beauty routine. Once you experience this down-to-earth everyday living your entire life, routine and essential existence becomes simplified and you instantly have a better understanding of who you are and where you’re going. Style truly is an amazing way to convey who you are and where you are. From colors and textures to fit and flow, the way you dress is the quickest way to make an impression. Here are the five ways to achieve perfect Zanzibar girl style – effortless, minimal and in it for daily adventure.  Embrace the ultimate accessory: a summer fedora A clean and steady water supply isn’t always a given in Africa, combine that with the relentless UV rays and you have two solid reasons to always wear a hat. Find the perfect lightweight summer fedora and make it your ultimate go-to accessory for both beach, safari, city and coconut time. My current favorite fedoras on every budget: Wallaroo Sun Hat from Amazon ($52), Straw Fedora from Forever 21 ($10) or this fun Color-Trimmed Fedora from Anthropologie ($68)  Mind the culture and religion The locals of Zanzibar and many parts of Africa are dominantly Muslim. As most travelers do, I suggest respecting their way of life with a completely open mind and heart. Africa is sweltering and us west coast gals may be tempted to wear crop tops and daisy dukes, but dressing on the conservative side (covered shoulders, knees and no bare midriff) is truly no sacrifice to make if you wear something lightweight. Take the opportunity to experiment with twirl-worthy maxi dresses and fun long sleeves. Long-sleeve maxi dresses to rock this spring: Floral Maxi from Forever 21 ($28) or this Enchanted Floral Maxi from Needle & Thread (my current obsession).  Less is more The ultimate takeaway most of us westerners take away from rural and developing parts of Africa (poverty inflicted regions excluded) is the incredible experience of witnessing people live life happily with hardly anything. I came to Africa with an overweight suitcase, 20 outfits, half a Sephora store and a curling iron. After about 12 hours in Africa, you will abandon your materialistic and needy self and feel good in your own skin – sans makeup, hair up or wavy, and a lightweight dress you’re obsessed with.  Match the vibrant culture Ditch neutrals, whites and blacks – there is nothing less than vivacious and colorful in Africa. Embrace risque patterns that would normally garner skeptical looks in your own city. Judgement isn’t a thing in Africa, and even on those rare occasions where made, it certainly isn’t over anything as trivial as fashion choices. Be bold, be loud, be you – Africa is the place to do it.  Create your own clothes Have you ever dreamed of custom tailoring your own dress? While this wasn’t at all on my itinerary, Stone Town (Zanzibar’s must-visit historical city) is brimming with fabric vendors for prices that will forever put your daily Starbucks run into perspective. I brought with me a jumpsuit from Antropologie that cost more than I’d like to admit. Upon discovering the irresistible fabric selection and the in-house tailor at my resort, I had a copy made that cost around two Starbucks lattes. There is nothing like enjoying Africa in local-made clothing and supporting the growth of local businesses at the same time. Responsible tourism meets fashion in Africa, and I suggest every backpacker, jetsetter, and explorer explore this option.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/lushoto-tanzania-guide/,"The Breathtaking Vistas of Lushoto, Tanzania",Tanzania,"﻿ The campground guard grasped my hand tightly and with enthusiasm, switching from grabbing my thumb to my palm, as handshakes are done in Africa. He asked me where I’m from and when I said ‘America’ he closed his eyes as though he was trying to picture it. “Does the sun come up every day in America, like here?” He asked, adorably. I told him that it did. “is it winter there now?” he wondered. I told him that in some parts of the country, it is quite cold. He seemed satisfied with those answers. Then I offered him one of the 20 or so mangoes we’d bought from a roadside vendor for about $1.50, and he was so excited that he hugged me – twice. We’d come a long way that day from the humid heat and light blue waters of the coast to the mountains that we’d been seeing in the distance for so long. The heat made way for cooler temperatures as we climbed meter after meter into Lushoto in Tanga, Tanzania, watching the arid ground turn into red farmland before settling at a quaint little farm lodge called Irente Farm Lodge. Now all over Southern and Eastern Africa, I’ve become very used to friendly, curious people and in particular, children running out to say hello, but Lushoto seemed to be on another level. As we walked on several of the those red dirt roads seeking views from up above, it wasn’t just children who excitedly ran to the road to say “Jambo!” (Hello in Swahili), but the adults as well who would say hello and, “Karibu” (welcome). It really is the nicest thing when people warmly welcome you as an outsider. Our quest was to see what was rumored to be one of the best views in Tanzania. This took us up a few mud and dirt roads, climbing in the sun and thankful for the light breeze. I had a feeling that we wouldn’t see much. The crop burning had made the sky a hazy brown, so milky you could barely see through it into the distance. However we did find a nice patch of ferns, and some dramatic rock formations. Later in the day, we tried again, walking to the Irente viewpoint for sunset. Just then, the sky opened up and in what seemed like no time at all, went from a sporadic drop here and there to a full on monsoon. The rainy season was starting in east Africa, after all. That night a solid sheet of water came down for two hours, leaving me wondering how good my tent really was as I hunkered down in the farm lodge, running out into the rain to stir the dinner we were cooking over a wood fire in a covered area outdoors from town to time. Of course, the other campsite guard insisted on helping me build the fire and helped watch the poike (stew) as it bubbled for a couple of hours. Don’t worry, he got a helping of stew and a nice tip. The next morning I awoke mostly dry, and we decided to make a last-ditch effort to see the viewpoint. Third time’s a charm. The rain had cleared all of the smoke and I’m happy to report, the view is truly spectacular.   The viewpoint is easy to access from the farm on foot. It takes about 20 minutes to walk there, give or take, or you can drive there in about 5 minutes if you have a car. You’ll arrive at the Irente Cliff Lodge, and you can either pay 1000 TZS (about 50 cents USD), to cut out some of the walk and go through the lodge lobby, or you can bypass it and walk in from lower down on the road. Either way, it costs 2000 TSZ to gain access to the viewpoint, which is advertised as going to the village.  Be careful up there. It’s a sheer drop from the rocks above, and as you can see, that would be one long fall! We left town that day a lighter in spirit, thankful to have been welcomed so warmly by everyone in town, including the guard at the bank who vigorously shook my hand and even escorted me to the machine to draw my cash out, smiling the whole time. This is potentially one of my biggest reasons for loving Africa so much – the warmth and hospitality. Yes, the people are poor and desperate and some heckle tourists for money (wouldn’t you in their position?) but when it comes down to it they are kind, curious, and ever the most gracious hosts. Lushoto, you were beautiful in so many ways. Do it yourself: What a view! Definitely worth the effort to get there. Wow. Shows that perseverance really does pay off. Stunning photos of that view and also of the stars above the truck!! Great post. You’re making Tanzania look awesome! Haha that fern gully pic, I just imagined you popping up then disappearing again. Lushoto just sounds fantastic, and the campground guard is pretty much the best thing ever. So awesome. I think my goal this year will be to save for Africa finally. Thanks for the inspiration yet again Krisitn =) It’s a bit on the expensive side but not if you start more south and not if you’re willing to go public transport. Man, it’s not like anything I’ve dealt with before though. It’s actually pretty dangerous and I try to avoid it. We loved Lushoto so much! The people were amazing and the views at Irente at sunset were breathtaking.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-tides-lodge-tanzania/,Where to Stay on the Coast in Tanzania,Tanzania,"There’s a shade of blue that I’m convinced you can only find on the Indian Ocean. It’s that aquamarine hue over white sand, so light that you can see just about anything swimming through it. I’m sure of this from much intensive study of the countries with coasts on this ocean, and on the sand bar that day, my theory was proven correct when we saw a turtle gliding through that impossibly clear water. Now there are a lot of warm beaches in the world, where the water feels like it came out of a bath faucet. There are many with white sand and crystal clear water, it’s true. But what’s special about this beach is that there’s almost nobody on it save for a local passing by here and there, and that, to me, is always perfection. Far from the bustle and tourists of Zanzibar, Ushongo Beach on the Tanzanian coast near Pangani is calm, quiet, and idyllic. I’d taken a small speed boat to that sand bar while staying at the Tides Lodge with Cam and Natasha, whom I joined for an epic overland trip in their Land Cruiser across Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda. It’s the cutest thing, if a sand bar can be cute, which appears during low tide and disappears again when the water rises for the evening. You can walk across the entire thing in a few minutes, and if you’re lucky, there might not even be anyone else there. There are reefs nearby for snorkeling, a temporary shade to lounge under thanks to the efforts of the boat guides, and a delicious seafood lunch from the Tides Lodge to boot. For $45, it’s a pretty awesome way to spend a day.  While we’re on the topic of food, the menu at the hotel impressed me quite a bit, with a breakfast spread of fresh fruit, muesli, and cooked-to-order eggs with guacamole or huevos rancheros. Dinner was equally incredible. Have you ever had passion fruit ceviche or beef so tender it almost melted in your mouth? There’s always a fresh catch of the day on offer. It’s on the sea, after all. The room was a spacious one-room bungalow nestled in the sand, a few steps away from that warm and wonderful water. I loved the big and comfy bed, surrounded by princess-like mosquito nets (though it seemed mostly for show as I came out of the stay there bite-free, which is a feat, considering that mosquitoes absolutely love me.) My days were spent lounging, eating entirely too much because I couldn’t help myself, and then kayaking in the ocean over to the mangroves. Though it felt to me like I was paddling forever against the current in both directions, I’m still thankful for the chance to paddle down the gorgeous coast, past the seabirds and the golden hour-tinted sand bars, and for the calories I burned and the defined triceps I (no-doubt, right?) sculpted in the process. That would have been enough to put Ushongo Beach high up on my list as far as the Tanzanian coast goes, but there’s another gem you should know about, in case you’re in a big group, want a more luxurious experience, or are on a killer honeymoon: The Mawimbi Villa. It’s a six animal-themed bedroom villa right on the sand with a full-time staff who can cook you up delicious food whenever you want. Plus it’s got an awesome pool. I can just imagine coming back here with 12 friends and having a complete blast, hanging in hammocks and messing around in the pool and in the ocean all day. Or maybe even doing a destination wedding (though I guess you need a boyfriend first for that, right?). So if you’re considering a Tanzanian holiday, go ahead and give Zanzibar a look, and maybe even a visit too. But be sure to come here afterwards, and bask in the peace and quiet. Getting there:  You have a couple of options including driving in via the ferry in Pangani (which is what we did) in either a rental SUV or your own if you’re on a longer-term overland trip. There’s an airstrip nearby which you can fly into, and then organize a transfer. More information here. *This post was brought to you in collaboration with The Dovetail Agency. All opinions of this amazing beach, as always, are sincere and my own.  I’ve been wanting to go to Zanzibar ever since my son was there, after he stayed in Tanzania doing some research (interviewing local farmers about the elephant problem) for his exam paper. Now I’m not so sure any more. I’m not much into bustling places, but prefer not so touristy ones. Ushongo Beach sounds serene, like a place to rewind, relax and find the path back to your self.  Thanks for the beautiful pictures, and the great info 🙂 I think Zanzibar is still cool, particularly Stone Town, but you should just do both! You’re right of course, it would be kind of stupid not to take the chance to see both places  while being there. I think first go to  Zanzibar and then relaxing on Ushongo Beach 🙂 Normally I’m very adamantly not a beach person but you make this look so amazing that I’m really into the idea of going here now! Zanzibar never interested me but this place looks fantastic It’s so calm and nice, while I enjoyed Zanzibar I really like beaches like this that are quiet and secluded! Oh My God, I’m like salivating over your pictures. I’m headed to Mombasa, Kenya in a couple months, and was undecided about if I should try to get to Zanzibar…UNTIL NOW! I can’t miss out on this. Thanks for sharing. And enabling.  🙂 Zanzibar is still the best. I have been there several time, but i still enjoy it    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/zanzibar-holidays/,Zanzibar: Not the Eastern Africa You Thought You Knew,Tanzania,"“When you leave Africa, as the plane lifts, you feel that more than leaving a continent you’re leaving a state of mind. Whatever awaits you at the other end of your journey will be of a different order of existence”~ Fransesca Marciano, “Rules of the Wild” Eastern Africa was a different ball game than Southern Africa had been. The relative availability of luxuries like WiFi, hot water, and ATMs that actually worked in South Africa, Namibia, and Zambia made way for mud huts and brown water, when it was running, that is. Something else changed, too. Coppper-hued Namibia, with only 2 million people, was the kind of place where you could drive all day and never see another person. Eastern Africa, on the other hand, is heavily populated. This meant an increase in traffic, but also an increase of towns and people as I passed by. People who, just about every time they saw the truck, started waving and smiling. I stopped reading books and instead turned my body towards the window just so that I could wave to each person in kind. children and adults alike would raise a hand and wave, playing outside of the mud huts and seeking shelter from the midday sun in the overhanging palm fronds. I don’t know why they wave, as I didn’t often encounter this type of courtesy coming from a place in California where I hardly knew my neighbors. Perhaps it’s not every day that they see foreigners passing through. Perhaps it’s just what they do there, to each other as well. Because it’s such a novel concept, it’s that much more special for me when someone acknowledges my existence in the world, and I do the same in return. We connect wordlessly for that millisecond in time. The days driving through Malawi and Tanzania were long, and when the time finally came to board the ferry and cross into Zanzibar, I was ready for the beach break. Zanzibar appears in person just as it does in the photos: white sand, aquamarine waters, and sideways sail boats. The days were spent lounging on the rope and wooden chaise chairs, SCUBA diving in the clear waters with octopus and Napoleon Wrasse (with Zanzibar watersports, which I’d recommend if you find yourself there), and joking around with the locals who live in the area. Nights were spent dancing at reggae bars with local Masaai, dressed in draped red checkered regalia, and talking about life in the villages with a new friend I’d made on the beach, Niko. We’d bonded when he came up to my friend Maddie and I (a girl I’d met on the overland safari), and we spent a good hour lightheartedly joking around and discussing his beaded bracelets and negotiating the price for a rainbow one. He saw me as a friend after that, expressing sadness when I left three days later. My final night, I waded out into the calm, warm ocean alone, leaving Niko and Maddie on the sand. It was a particularly soft sunset, if that makes any sense. It was the type that seems to move more slowly than normal, like the day isn’t interested in ending. The waveless water was so calm, it all blended together as the sun dipped below the horizon. For a good half hour, everything was bathed in golden light. Standing in the water, the temperature inside even warmer than outside, I thanked Africa for the four months of growth. I thanked it for opening my eyes to another world I never knew existed. At times it was heartbreaking, bewildering, and shocking, and at other times uplifting, delightful, and heart-warming. The next morning I left the truck behind and made my way, solo, back to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania to board my flight home to Berlin. Sitting in hours of traffic (the city is renowned for it), sweating through my clothes and swatting away mosquitoes, I should have been perfectly happy to leave Africa behind in a cloud of dust. Yet I couldn’t feel anything but grateful. I couldn’t help but feel unprepared to leave. Africa had grown on me and me on Africa. I left behind roots and little pieces of my being there. Asante Sana (thank you so much), Africa. If I’d left this earth without seeing you for my own eyes, then I would have missed out on a precious treasure. — A note about the final 35 days of my Africa experience: I joined an overland safari truck with Acacia Africa (this is the itinerary) with a small group of others, all of whom I really enjoyed the company of and bonded with. I normally travel independently and never take tours, however this one was really special, and incredibly well-organized, hitting all of the beautiful highlights. Each member of the truck was expected to help with cooking and cleaning, and we slept in tents every night (unless we chose to sleep under the stars instead). This is the type of tour I would recommend to anyone who typically doesn’t like tours, but who is traveling solo through this area. As a lone girl mainly in countries without public transport, I saw this as my only option. I’d love to do it again with a few friends in a Land Rover, and it’s certainly on the docket for the future. However by myself, this was a great way to do it. Some of the safari was provided at a discount, however I covered the local expenses. Even if it had all been free, or even if I had paid for it entirely, I’d say the same thing – it was a really good safari, and I plan to join them again for more in the future. I felt the same way leaving Africa too. I was so not expecting to love it the way I did. I’ve never felt so connected to a place and it’s people before and I was only there a couple weeks. Totally agree. I felt such a deep connection to it. It is the origin of humankind, after all. Hi Kristin,You gave a great information with us. Keep rocking. all the best. Beautiful pictures- the color of that water is so inviting. Really enjoyed your comparison of the different coasts.  Thanks for sharing! Katie @ Katie Wanders Thanks Katie! Definitely interesting going from the Skeleton coast to Zanzibar and everything in between, but was beautiful. I loved reading about your journey and how you changed after visiting Africa.  I’ve wanted to visit Africa to have a similar experience.  The tour you mentioned sounds like a great fit.  I don’t often like tours, but this one sounds like you get to experience the culture and life of Africa, not just see the sites.  Your pictures are beautiful and I hope I get to see it in person soon! It wasn’t your typical tour and I’d say more a safari, if they can be separated like that. There was tons of wildlife-related activities but the cultural interaction happened more for me in South Africa and generally when left more to my own devices. Great post, and beautiful pictures Kristin. I was in Tanzania and Zanzibar for 3 wks last year. The landscape and wildlife was stunning, and I felt the people were incredibly kind and optimistic about their future. Within a week of coming back, I was planning where to go next, which is Namibia for a month. I’d love to do the Rover rental as well, but as you noted, sometimes camping with a group is a good option too. I really liked the group dynamic and for once, not having to make 100% of the decisions myself as well. I definitely shy away from tours, but the one you took doesn’t sounds too awful! I was supposed to travel through Eastern Africa last year and plans fell through, so I’m hoping I can make it happen soon! It was great and didn’t really feel like a tour all that much. After almost 3 years of calling all the shots I was about ready to let someone else take over. it was nice and an actual vacation! Definitely i love your amazing photos. Thank you for sharing 🙂 Thanks so much, Tracy 🙂 Hi Kristin, Just curious, how did you find the tour group Acacia Africa? I am actually going to Tanzania myself in August, taking a course with the National Outdoor Leadership School. I looked into going to Zanzibar afterwards, but wanted to go with a group as this is my very first trip abroad and am not yet comfortable to be completely on my own. I did not come across that group in all of my googling. A few people actually discouraged me from going to Zanzibar as a solo female traveler. I have a friend who knows a few people who were mugged there as well. Ultimately I have decided to stay in the Arusha area afterwards and do a bit more site seeing around there. Maybe Zanzibar another time! It looks beautiful! I found them when I was searching the term, “Safari” for Namibia and South Africa. It’s an overland safari type of thing so perhaps that’s why they came up. I think it was an excellent group and you should definitely give Zanzibar a go! Looks amazing! I would love love love to go to Zanzibar (or anywhere in Africa ha)- hopefully later this year! It’s lovely! Where do you most want to go? Jambo!;) Very informative article, thanks a lot! I’m arriving in Zanzibar next month, my first time in Tanzania. I will be staying in Makunduchi Clove Island and although the place itself is really awesome, I’m hungry for seeing new spots and doing a lot of different things. Your article inspires me!:) Lovely photos. Thanks once again! Can’t wait 🙂 Cool let me know how you like it! Jambo!.;) Very informative article, thanks a lot! I’m arriving in Zanzibar next month.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/hawaii-big-island-itinerary/,The Perfect Hawaii Big Island Itinerary,United States,"Hawaii’s Big Island is full of adventures. From mountaintops to under the sea, it’s the most diverse and largest island in Hawaii by far. I spent three weeks on the Big Island, exploring the coasts and jungles in between. This itinerary includes multiple options depending on how much time you have and whatever your desires may be.  Given that I’m a water lover and Hawaii has some of the best underwater adventures possible, I’ll start with a short itinerary out of Kona that involves beautiful beaches and dolphins. This three day itinerary is perfect if you would like to just remain in the Kona area: Begin your adventure with an early morning swim with wild dolphins in the bay around Kona. This is one of the coolest experiences that I’ve had with marine animals. Getting to glide in the water alongside pods of dolphins is magical. You can book it here.  To round out the day, spend some time at the beach in between your dolphin experience and the nighttime manta ray snorkel. Watch as majestic manta rays glide under you, feeding on the plankton that the lights fixed to the boats attracts. It doesn’t get much better than this for a first day on the Big Island!  If you didn’t get enough dolphins (and who can ever get enough?), head to Two Step in the very early morning to see if you can see some more hanging out in the bay. Otherwise, this is also one of the best snorkeling spots on the island. If you really want the best of the best, check out Kealakekua Bay, which is only accessible via kayak or snorkeling tour. If you’re open to taking another tour, I recommend this one. Otherwise, self drive to Two Step and bring your own snorkel and fins. Next, drive south and spend part of the afternoon taking a 45 minute walk along the coast to Papakōlea Green Sand Beach, one of only four green sand beaches in the world. If you still have some time left, stop by Punalu’u Black Sand Beach to see Hawaiian sea turtles. Head northwest on day three to the Pololū Valley Lookout. This would be a great spot to visit early if you don’t want to share it with too many people and want to see the sunrise. It’s possible to hike along the beach cliffs if you’re up for it as well. Finish the day on the white sand beach of Hapuna and catch the sunset before heading out. If you’d prefer to spend more time on land, but you’re short on time, then I recommend instead checking out the Big Island’s most famous feature: Volcanoes National Park. This itinerary makes a lot more sense if you will be flying into Hilo. Using it as your base, these are the adventures you can have: You’re almost guaranteed to feel like you’re walking on the surface of the moon. Though there are tons of hikes, I really enjoyed the Kīlauea Iki Crater Trail and catching golden hour to sunset near the steam vents. This is the one of the only places in Hawaii where you can see snow. If you would like to see a truly unique part of Hawaii, this is it. There are multi-day hikes in the park, though you can get a great overview with the summit trail.  Go chasing waterfalls by beginning the day early at Akaka Falls State Park and making your way north to the Waipi’o Valley Lookout. Get some hiking in if you’re up for a challenge, or head over to the Pololū Valley for another gorgeous lookout and a shorter hike option. If you have a week or longer, rent a car and plan to stay all around the island as you turn this into an epic road trip. Keep in mind that the Big Island lives up to its name, and is surprisingly big!  Repeat the suggestion for the first three day itinerary and swim with mantas and dolphins. Truly, this experience is magical! Make your way south from Kona, stopping by Two Step on the way and arriving at Papakōlea Green Sand Beach around noon. Be sure to take a hat and sunscreen with you as there is no coverage on the walk. You can also pay a local to drive you or take your own 4 x 4 vehicle, though the road was so rough I turned back. Consider stopping by the South Point cliff jump, especially if you want to snorkel with the fish ball. Finish your day with golden hour at the black sand beach and check into an Airbnb (here’s a discount off your first booking) in Volcano for the night Note that you will probably want to bring snacks or maybe even some lunch with you. There isn’t a lot of food options apart from Naalehu near the South Point, where there’s a pretty good food truck called Aloha Mix. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is one of the most unique things to do in Hawaii! There are numerous hiking trails of varying distances to choose from, or if you’re not much of a hiker, plenty of points that you can drive up to. This is what I recommend checking out: Hilo will feel a lot more authentically Hawaii than Kona does. There’s a lot of great food in town and since your previous few days will have been action packed, it’s nice to just chill and explore the town while checking out some of the waterfalls, like Rainbow Falls and, of course, the botanical gardens and Onomea Bay Trail. Head to Akaka Falls State Park right when it opens to avoid the crowds, and continue to make your way north to the Waipi’o Valley Lookout. I recommend going for a little hike here, or if that is too strenuous, continue on to Waimea. There are plenty of ranches in this area that offer horseback riding and opportunities to try the delicious local coffee. This is one of my favorite parts of the Big Island, the Pololū Valley. If you’re motivated, this is an amazing sunrise spot. There’s also a hike that stretches down from the lookout and continues, almost endlessly, though the conditions may not be great the farther you go. From here, make your way down to Hapuna Beach for the day. You’ll have beautiful white sand and an incredible sunset. Head back home out of Kona, assuming that your last day is a travel day. If not, I recommend working in an extra day in this itinerary in Volcano in case you experience rain, which is common in that area. I spent two weeks on the Big Island during my last visit and even that didn’t feel like enough! I did the 7-day itinerary but took it a little bit slower, spending an entire day at the South Point cliff jump and multiple days in Volcanoes National Park, as well as a day in Puna doing the Pepeekeo Scenic Drive. I was also house hunting, which you can see on YouTube. Next time I’m out there, I plan to do a lot more hiking around Mauna Kea, which was closed when I was there, and to spend more time on the Hamakua Coast. If you’re looking for true Hawaiian beauty, love the sunrise, and peace and quiet appeal to you, it doesn’t get much better. Couple that with numerous waterfalls and gorgeous views and you’ve got my favorite part of the Big Island. I’m still exploring and getting to know it, but I would highly recommend doing some multi-day hikes on the Big Island, if that’s what you’re into, and exploring the Hawaiian culture and history. Be sure to reference this post which goes geographically from Kona, down south then east to Hilo, and then back up and around, for the full listing of all of the best things to do in Hawaii. Enjoy the island, it’s my favorite out of them all.  PLEASE: When traveling in Hawaii, swear off plastic. Take refillable water bottles and shopping bags, and don’t buy items that come in single use plastic, like soft drinks, fruit, bagged lettuce etc. Hawaii no longer recycles plastic or paper! Please help keep the islands clean. *Some links in this post are affiliate links to companies that I personally use and trust. They help support this site at no extra cost to you.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/kona-things-to-do/,"The Best Things to Do in Kona, Hawaii",United States,"It’s no secret that the Big Island of Hawaii stole my heart. I’ve become such a fan, so I want to help you explore every nook and cranny. Since most people begin their Big Island adventure in Kona, I figured you might be wondering how to maximize your time there.  From activities to places to eat, these are the best things to do in Kona, Hawaii:  By far one of the best things to do in Kona — or anywhere in Hawaii for that matter — is to swim with some of the amazing sea creatures! I swam with wild dolphins and it was an incredible experience. Since it takes place in the morning, you can also pack in this nighttime manta ray adventure, where you’ll cruise the ocean at sunset and watch manta rays glide by on their quest for plankton. I can’t think of a better way to spend a day in Hawaii.  Hapuna Beach is the largest white sand beach on the big island, and luckily it’s only about a 45-minute drive north of Kona. This half-mile stretch of soft sand was even named one of the top ten beaches in the U.S. in 2019. Parking is $5 and both bathrooms and outdoor showers are provided. This a great spot for swimming, snorkeling, and sunsets!  See colorful little fish like this guy as well as dolphins, turtles, and monk seals at Two Step! It’s an awesome snorkeling spot on Honaunau Bay, 30 miles south of Kona. It’s acclaimed as one of the most beautiful spots on the island, with clear blue waters, a vibrant reef, and dozens of marine species. Here’s a few helpful tips: Park in the nearby $5 lot, watch out for dangerous currents, and be sure to use reef-safe sunscreen! The best thing about Two Step is it’s easy to access. Be sure to bring your own gear.  Volcanic soil and frequent cloud cover make for the perfect coffee-growing conditions; as a result, Kona coffee is world-renowned for both flavor and aroma. Take the opportunity to embrace Kona coffee culture with a free tour at the Mountain Thunder Coffee Plantation, which is a 15-minute drive from downtown Kona. Tours run every hour on the hour from 10am to 4pm, seven days a week. Be sure to take home a souvenir of coffee beans or grounds while you’re there! About 20 miles south of downtown Kona is Kealakekua Bay, where the infamous Captain Cook landed in 1779. The bay is widely believed to be the site of the best snorkeling in all of Hawaii — how could it not be when it looks like this? However, this treasure is well guarded, as the snorkeling spots can really only be reached by a strenuous hike. A better option is to join a guided snorkeling or kayaking tour which will make sure you get exactly where you need to be with no trouble at all.  Drive 30 miles north of Kona to get to Anaeho’omalu Beach. The beach is protected by an offshore reef, keeping the water calm and providing ideal circumstances for snorkeling, swimming, and diving. You also have the option of renting outdoor equipment to play with for the day, like kayaks, hydrobikes, and bodyboards. And, of course, everyone loves a good sunset, and this beach is the perfect place to watch one.  Get into the local feel with the Kona Farmers Market, open Wednesday through Sunday from 7am to 4pm. The market is located in the heart of Kona, and more than 40 vendors offer everything from a wide variety of fresh local produce and flowers to Kona coffee and arts & crafts. Whether or not you end up purchasing much, it’s a great opportunity to find a healthy snack and chat with locals!   Check out the historic downtown area of Kailua-Kona, which is home to several famous landmarks. Two of the most notable are Hulihee Palace and Mokuaikaua Church (pictured above), both on the main road running through downtown. The area was once a place where Hawaiian royals like King Kamehameha liked to reside and where fishing was the main occupation of those who lived there. Today, its roots are still clearly evident but exist alongside a modern spirit marked by vibrant food, music, and people.  This secluded white sand beach is just so pretty! The beach is part of Kekaha Kai State Park, about 15 miles northwest of Kona. The clear, calm waters here are ideal for snorkeling and swimming, and the beach is easily accessible by paved road. Other helpful amenities here include bathrooms, showers, barbecues, and picnic tables. Overall, Kua Bay is a great spot to spend a day, but keep in mind that it can get busy on the weekends, so maybe save this one for the middle of the week.  Half the fun of going on a trip is getting to experience the local cuisine, and Hawaii is an especially awesome place for great food. With a focus on fresh, local ingredients, the food scene in Kona has a lot to offer. Here are some delicious spots to check out:  Huggo’s on the Rocks: Huggo’s offers a fun and laid-back atmosphere and a fresh menu of burgers, salads, sandwiches, fish, and more. Plus, happy hour from 3 to 5pm every afternoon and live music every night mean that this is the perfect place to wrap up a busy day in Kona. If you’re looking for a sunset dinner on the water that isn’t too fancy, this is a great spot! Umekes: Umeke’s is known both near and far (they have more than 10,000 followers on Instagram) for delicious poke and seafood made with only high quality, local ingredients. Umekes has two locations in Kona: one at Ali’i Plaza and one on Kaiwi Street (as a fish market bar and grill), each of which has its own menu and atmosphere. Island Ono Loa Grill: Some say that Island Ono Loa Grill makes the best burgers in Kona, and with good reason: they fire-grill them over lava rocks and serve them on Hawaiian sweet buns! What’s more, their ingredients are locally sourced, and it’s both a quick and inexpensive stop. Besides the mouth-watering burgers, there are also cool hot dogs, specialty sandwiches, and local plates on the menu.  Papa Kona Restaurant and Bar: Papa Kona features local musicians almost every night of the week, and their pub-style lounge menu of appetizers, burgers, tacos, and more makes for a laid-back atmosphere. This seems to be a great spot for a bite, a drink, and some music. They also have an awesome brunch!  Broke da Mouth Grindz: This spot has been featured on Guy Fieri’s Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and is beloved by tourists and locals alike. The menu is full of traditional Filipino staples with a fresh Hawaiian spin on them. It seems to be one of the best places to eat on the Big Island, hands down!  Hayashi’s Sushi (You Make The Roll): This small, family-run sushi place is hugely popular among locals. In fact, if you go at lunch hour, you’ll likely have to wait an hour or more for your sushi! However, for delicious, affordable, and high-quality sushi, it seems to be worth it. Maybe just try to go at an off-time so you won’t spend so long in line. Basik Açaí Cafe: You can’t go to Hawaii and not have an açaí bowl! Basik Cafe is a great place to get one, with a variety of fresh, colorful bowls and smoothies which are all dairy-free and plant-based. Plus, they’re just gorgeous!  Herbivores: This drive-through and walk-up spot uses the phrase, “healthy fast food” as its claim to fame. I don’t even know what category to put this cool little place under, because they offer breakfast, lunch, dinner, coffee, and smoothies, all of which look delicious! Its menu is largely plant-based and gluten-free, and has a laid-back atmosphere.   Kalikala Cuisine: Kalikala Cuisine is a family-owned oceanfront lanai on a picturesque street. Sit in the shaded patio and order one of their beautiful breakfast or lunch plates while you enjoy the seaside views. The atmosphere isn’t the only good part, though; the food is supposed to be excellent!  808 Grindz Cafe: Some say that 808 Grindz has a hole-in-the-wall vibe, but in the best way: big portions, friendly staff, and reasonable prices. Overall, it’s a great spot for a casual and authentic Hawaiian breakfast, and its largely frequented by locals. Just keep in mind that it’s cash-only! Barefoot Zone: Barefoot Zone is a healthy option which focuses on fresh, whole foods in a fun way. Try one of their colorful bowls packed to the brim with fresh fruit, or indulge your sweet side with a gluten-free, dairy-free crêpe. They also have tons of other plant-based options, including veggie sushi! Island Lava Java: The oceanside Island Lava Java restaurant has a huge menu which covers breakfast, lunch, and dinner, all made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The restaurant itself has a bright, cheery atmosphere, plus there’s an on-site bakery if you want to take one of their delicious breakfast pastries with you on the go!  Holy Donuts: Head to Holy Donuts for quirky, fun donuts freshly made every morning. It’s said to have the best donuts on the Big Island, and with good reason! They look both gorgeous and delicious, thanks to unique flavors like pineapple fritter and creme brûlée.   Kona Wave Coffee: Kona Wave Coffee is a cute little place with a full espresso bar, açaí bowls, and all natural shave ice. This isn’t your typical cup of shave ice, either: it’s a saucer full of it with add-ins like ice cream, natural fruit syrups, boba, mochi, fresh fruit, and anything else you want to throw in there!  I hope this post helps you to discover the amazing beach and aquatic adventures that Kona has to offer, along with the delicious side!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-time-to-visit-hawaii/,The Best Time to Visit Hawaii,United States,"When it comes to the Aloha State, warm weather and a tropical vibe are almost a given, but that doesn’t mean that Hawaii doesn’t experience seasons.  Whether you’re looking for smaller crowds, drier weather, a bit less humidity, or just a better understanding of overall weather to expect, this post will help you determine the best time to visit Hawaii based on your needs and desires:  Each island differs in terms of rainfall and dryness. Some islands, like the Big Island, will differ from region to region, sometimes experiencing several ‘seasons’ in a day. With that in mind, here are some statewide averages for Hawaii during the time that is considered fall through mid-winter in most of the US: The ‘spring’ will bring progressively drier weather in general and warmer temperatures, too. With the exception of Spring Break time, which can last for a while when considering universities, secondary (upper), and elementary (primary, lower) schools are on varying schedules, it can be a great time to visit: For the driest months of the year, head to Hawaii during the summer. Keep in mind, this is a popular time in the US for vacation, and you might have more crowds than usual.  With most of the kiddos back in school and no major holidays, the autumn months in Hawaii can be perfect. The shoulder season means fewer people while the weather remains pleasant.  Overall, here’s what you should keep in mind when planning a trip to Hawaii: It is best to avoid holiday breaks, which will be crowded and expensive. Hurricane season runs from June through November. However, direct hits are rare, they weaken as they reach Hawaii, and they can even occur off-season, so I wouldn’t let that factor into your travel plans but always stay tuned on weather conditions right before your trip. Opt for cheaper, off-season months like March, May, September, and October, some of which might even have better weather than the more popular times of year! thats so far away from europe unfortuantely .one day I will comexoxo     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/most-beautiful-places-in-hawaii/,20 of Hawaii’s Most Beautiful Places,United States,"The Aloha State is known for lush mountains, dotted with hidden waterfalls and framed by gorgeous beaches in almost every color from green, to red, black, and white.  What visitors might find surprising is the diversity. The Big Island has 8 of the world’s microclimates while Lanai is a dry, Mediterranean subtropical climate, and Kauai is in large part tropical, but actually has 7 microclimates too including a dry side! The surf conditions are world class in some areas, while the snorkeling, sometimes with dolphins and even whales, is unbeatable in others. Struggling to pick where to go? Look no further than these 20 most beautiful places in Hawaii:  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and while Hawaii Volcanoes National Park looks like the surface of the moon, it is probably one of the coolest places on planet Earth! The park is home to two active volcanoes, one of which is the most active volcano in the world. It spans more than 300,000 acres and offers 150 miles of hiking trails through several different landscapes and ecosystems. The starry night skies there are unbelievable, too! Read more about the Big Island’s best things to do here.  Molokai’s lush, green Halawa Valley is one of the oldest known settlements in the Hawaiian Islands. On the east end of the island, the valley is home to Mooula Falls, a two-tiered, 250-foot waterfall which can be seen for miles. The valley itself can only be reached on foot with the help of a guide, which is worth booking, but the incredible view pictured above can be seen from a turnout at mile marker 26 of Kamehameha V Highway. On the east side of Maui, the Pools of ‘Ohe’o, or “Seven Sacred Pools,” as they’re more colloquially referred to as, are a series of small waterfalls and plunge pools fed by a stream running through the rainforest. Not only are the pools popular for swimming and cliff-jumping, but also the scenery is magical! The site is part of Haleakala National Park and the Road to Hana, which you’ll see later in the list.  Also called Waianuenue Falls, Rainbow Falls earned its nickname thanks to the rainbows that appear in the mist around 10am each day. The 80-foot falls is part of Wailuku River State Park, about 2 miles outside of downtown Hilo. There, you can also see the nearby Boiling Pots, cute little springs which bubble like they’re boiling.  On Molokai’s west side, great waves and no one around make Papohaku one of the best beaches in Hawaii. It is one of the largest white sand beaches in all of the Hawaiian Islands, too, and has been nicknamed “Three Mile Beach” as a result. Not only is the beach itself gorgeous, but also a sunrise or sunset here would be even more stunning.  Keep in mind, the water here is seriously rough, and it’s not advisable to go in the water.  Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve, on the southeast coast of Oahu, is known for its picture-perfect combination of teal waters and warm yellow sand. The beautiful beach is protected by the curve of the bay as the island’s cliffs — the remains of a dormant volcano — jut out in both directions. The shallow waters are perfect for snorkeling, and although the beach often sees some crowds, it makes for a stunning real-life postcard.  The Ko’olau Mountains are the dormant remaining fragment of Oahu’s eastern shield volcano, most of which was washed into the ocean hundreds of thousands of years ago by a massive landslide. The landslide plus millennia of wind and rain erosion have given the mountains their steep, distinct look; at more than 3,000 feet in elevation, dozens of waterfalls run down the sides.  Some of the best hikes on the island can be found up in these mountains, and the views from the top are awe-inspiring.    Akaka Falls is the most famous of the Big Island’s waterfalls, and with good reason: it’s 442 feet tall! On the northeast coast of the island, it’s also the most easily accessible waterfall. The falls sits at the end of a half-mile hike through lush trees and flowers; getting there also takes you right past the smaller, 100-foot Kahuna Falls.  This gorgeous route is one of the best drives on the Big Island. Unfortunately, you’ll have to turn around at the road block created by the 2018 lava flow, but that’s just another cool reason to go check it out! You’ll also see magical tree tunnels like this one, fancy beach houses, and little bridges and waterfalls.  Kehena Black Sand Beach, in the Big Island’s eastern Puna district, is one interesting place. The contrast between the thick green fringe of trees, the deep black sand, and the vibrant blue ocean is such a unique sight; meanwhile, this is also the most volcanically active region of the island, which means that you could find yourself with a lava problem on your hands at any given moment!  Regardless of the volcanic potential, though, this beach has an eclectic spirit, visible through its drum circles and nude beach-goers.  Two miles of beach and a bright blue bay bookended by lush green mountains make Kauai’s Hanalei Bay a gorgeous spot. In the summer, the bay is calm and ideal for sailing and paddle-boarding, while winter brings great waves for surfing. At its center, the town of Hanalei has even been named Vogue’s “Hippest Town in Kauai“! This is certainly a North Shore gem. Few things are more beautiful than a pristine beach all to yourself! This 1.5-mile-long beach is nearly empty at any given time; it’s just you, the sea, the sand, and the other islands off in the distance. Nearby is the Garden of the Gods, a rock garden full of cool towers and formations which has some equally cool legends to go with it, as well as Sweetheart Rock. Check out more amazing things to do in Lanai here.  This two-stream, 173-foot (others claim anywhere from 80 to 200 feet depending on perspective) waterfall can be found at the south end of the Wailua River in eastern Kauai. Interestingly, this is the location of the opening scene of the old TV show, “Fantasy Island.” The falls can be seen from the road, and if you arrive at the right time in the morning, you might even catch a rainbow!  Southwest Kauai’s Waimea Canyon has earned the nickname, “The Grand Canyon of the Pacific.” It’s 14 miles long, a mile wide, and over 3,600 feet deep, but perhaps even more impressive is its array of colors. Cruise Waimea Canyon Drive for a couple of incredible lookout spots, or follow one of the many hikes to admire all the different shades of reds, browns, and greens. (Either way, admission is free!) Kaunolu, on the southern tip of Lanai, was once a fishing village frequented by King Kamehameha I; today, it is one of the island’s most sacred places. The village, home to the remains of Halulu Heiau and other artifacts, was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1962 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The area has spectacular views and would make for the perfect, quiet spot to watch a sunset.  Many consider Haleakala to be one of the most spiritual places on Earth, and even home to the heart chakra! The dormant volcano crater in southeast Maui stands at more than 10,000 feet tall and offers incredible natural scenery. “Haleakala” actually means, “house of the sun,” which has become the nickname of the crater as it coincides with the incredible sunrises there. (Sunsets and starry night skies are equally as impressive!)   Picturesque Kalaupapa on the island’s northern tip was once a colony for those chronically ill, mostly with leprosy, but they were compassionately treated by a man called Father Damien who arrived in 1873. Today, the stunning peninsula can only be accessed by mule ride, which follows a 1,700-foot descent from the cliffs to sea level. Whether or not you take the ride down, the views of Kalaupapa’s bright blue waters and vibrant green landscape are incredible!   Maui’s Road to Hana isn’t exactly one spot; it’s a bunch! However, driving this winding road (all 600 turns of it) makes for a special experience because of the sheer beauty around every corner. From waterfalls and tall bamboo to coastal lookouts and rainforest, the Road to Hana is without a doubt one of the most breathtaking journeys in all of the Hawaiian Islands.  The Nā Pali Coast on Kauai’s northwestern coastline is known for its 4,000-foot-tall, multi-colored cliffs. One way to explore this unbeatable scenery is to follow the Kalalau Trail, a rugged, 11-mile hike dating back to the 1800s, which travels through five valleys and ends at the pristine Kalalau Beach.  Or, kayak along the coastline and explore the sea caves and beaches scattered along it. Regardless, this is one of the most beautiful locations in the Hawaiian Islands.   Take in one of the most impressive views on the island at the Pololu Valley Lookout. It’s easy to get to, right off the highway, but you’d think you’d traveled to a secret spot because the scenery is so spectacular! If you’re up for it, follow the trail down to the beach below and then back up again for sunset, about a half-hour each way. This is a view you won’t soon forget!  While this list is far from exhaustive and is, of course, full of personal opinions, as someone who has had the pleasure of exploring all of Hawaii’s Islands, these are the spots that took my breath away. Happy travels in the Aloha State! PLEASE: When traveling in Hawaii, swear off plastic. Take refillable water bottles and shopping bags, and don’t buy items that come in single use plastic bottles, like soft drinks, fruit, etc. Hawaii no longer recycles plastic or paper! Please help keep the islands clean.  I would love to travel to all of these places!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/big-island-beaches/,The 8 Best Beaches on the Big Island of Hawaii,United States,"The Hawaiian Islands are known all around the world for their amazing beaches. The Big Island of Hawaii, in particular, has an abundance of them thanks to its sheer size.  But with so many to choose from, which beaches are most worth visiting? If you’re visiting the Big Island anytime soon, look no further! Below are the eight best beaches the island has to offer, ordered from the western Kona side of the island around clockwise to the southern side:  Makalawena Beach is the closest to Kona of all the beaches on this list (about 15 miles northwest). This stretch of pure white sand is not only gorgeous, but also usually empty, as it can only be reached by a one-mile hike past the parking area for Kekaha Kai Beach Park. (You’ll walk for about a half hour across a lava field.) Once you reach the beach, you’ll enjoy snorkeling, swimming, and plenty of peace and quiet!  A half-hour drive northeast up the coast is Anaeho’omalu Beach, where an offshore reef makes the calm bay a perfect spot to swim, snorkel, kayak, and paddle-board in. A wide stretch of salt-and-pepper sand guarantees that you’ll be able to sunbathe all you want, while ample parking nearby guarantees convenience for an easy beach afternoon.  Fifteen minutes further northeast, the white sand beach at Waialea Bay is lined with palm trees, creating that classic island feel which visitors to the island love so much! This beach is great not only for swimming, but also snorkeling, thanks to a wide variety of colorful fish and tropical marine species. Head another four miles up the coast and you’ll find Hapuna Beach, which was ranked as one of the top ten beaches in the U.S. in 2019! The largest white sand beach on the Big Island, Hapuna stretches for a half-mile. As if that isn’t reason enough to check it out, the snorkeling is great here, too! Entrance is $5 and there are shower and bathroom facilities.  Just two miles away, Kauna’oa Beach (also called Mauna Kea after a nearby hotel) is absolutely stunning. The crescent-shaped beach offers a quarter-mile of white sand and calm waters perfect for swimming and snorkeling. Plus, who wouldn’t want to stare at this view all day? A 45-minute drive up and around the northwest tip of the island gets you to Pololu Beach, a secluded black sand beach at the bottom of the Pololu Valley Lookout. (The lookout is one of my 25 top things to do on the Big Island!) Accessing the beach requires descending the 400 feet from the top of the cliffs, but the hike down offers incredible views and is half the fun of visiting Pololu!  Keep in mind, it’s dangerous to swim at this beach. While its beautiful, I recommend enjoying it from a hiker’s rather than a swimmer’s perspective.  Cruise all the way down to the southeast side of the island to Punalu’u, another black sand beach. Both on land and by sea, you’ll see Hawaiian green sea turtles, as well as lots of other cool creatures while snorkeling. The black sand against the blue water is such a cool scene, too! This beach is certainly one you won’t forget.  Last but certainly not least, 25 miles beyond Punalu’u to the SW lies the famous Papakōlea Green Sand Beach. You’ll find it on the southern tip of the island and it requires either an hour-long walk or a car with some serious four-wheel-drive to get there. It’s worth it, though, because this is one of only two green sand beaches in the United States, one of four in the whole world!  While these are just a few of the Big Island’s best beaches, I encourage you to keep exploring, because there are numerous options all over this wild, beautiful island.  PLEASE: When traveling in Hawaii, swear off plastic. Take refillable water bottles and shopping bags, and don’t buy items that come in single use plastic, like soft drinks, fruit, etc. Hawaii no longer recycles plastic or paper!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/big-island-spirituality/,Spiritual & Transformative Experiences on the Big Island of Hawaii,United States,"Hawaii is one of those places where everything just feels different. Maybe it’s the island lifestyle that’s extra relaxing, perhaps it’s the presence of the Hawaiian goddess Pele, the great creatress and deity of fire and volcanoes. Some feel that the Earth’s heart chakra resides in Hawaii. Regardless of what each person chooses to call it or how we experience it, the Big Island of Hawaii is a special, life-changing place. How can you get the most out of your visit to the island? The following are some amazing things to do while you’re there to have an especially transformative experience:  Four of the active volcanoes in Hawaii are on the Big Island, where Pele’s power is still evident and unpredictable. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is the perfect place to feel connected to Mother Nature and go on hikes all around the park. If you get a clear night, you can watch the sunset turn into an epic star-gazing opportunity.  To get the most out of Hawaii, explore the cultural significance of each island. On the southeast coast of the Big Island, a centuries-old cultural site sits within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. The Pu’u Loa Petroglyphs make up Hawaii’s largest field of petroglyphs, consisting of more than 23,000 etchings in the hardened lava that also make it the biggest concentration of rock art in all of the Hawaiian Islands. The petroglyphs are believed to have recorded events that took place, geographical trails and movement around the island. Pu’u Loa can be interpreted to mean “hill of long life,” and legend has it that important rituals were once conducted here in order to ensure long life for a newborn child. This site is a sacred and irreplaceable piece of Hawaiian history. Simply marvel in the hundreds of years of history and find some peace out in the open.  This six-day retreat in Hilo combines elements like yoga, sound healing, herbal medicine, massage and breathwork to create a rejuvenating and healing experience. The retreat provides three organic, vegetarian, whole-food-focused meals each day to help reset your health and nourish the body. Other activities include island excursions, hiking, self-worth workshops and more. You even get to spend the six days “glamping” in cool pyramid-shaped lodgings. Read more about this experience here! The town of Volcano is just 10 minutes from Volcanoes National Park, yet thanks to the way it’s situated and its elevation, it’s less likely to experience lava flow than much of the rest of the island; plus, it’s high enough that there are fewer mosquitoes around. The best part, however, is the abundance of off the grid, solar-powered and rain catchment-serviced eco-lodges and treehouses available there. It’s my favorite place in Hawaii (original name for “the Big Island”) to stay and close to my favorite coast. Read more about Hilo and why I love it so much on Alamo’s Scenic Route.  Twenty miles south of Kailua-Kona, the Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park protects a site which holds significant historical and cultural importance for Native Hawaiians (the word, “puuhonua” translates to, “place of refuge”). Visitors can see a 965-foot-long stone wall which was built over 400 years ago; nearby is a mausoleum that once housed the bones of 23 Hawaiian chiefs, which are believed to have given the site significant spiritual power, or “mana”. Though the bones were removed in the 19th century, the site still has a strong energy and is sacred to the Hawaiian people. Visit the area to feel the powerful energy for yourself.  On the North Kohala Coast, 50 acres of gardens, groves and valleys await you at Hawaii Island Retreat, a green boutique hotel. Not only does the eco-friendly property provide beautiful lodgings and organic cuisine, but also countless spa and yoga packages for guests to choose from in customizing their stays. Packages like “Yoga in Hawaii,” “Signature Spa Vacation” and “Return to Self,” are just a few of the options. On the property, guests will find an ocean-view yoga studio, an infinity pool, open-air dining, and suites, yurts, and bungalows. Alongside yoga and massage, Hawaii Island Retreat offers wellness classes ranging from chakra meditation and visualization to tai chi, hula and hypnotherapy. This could be just what you need to have a perfectly restorative experience in Hawaii.  In the late 1700s, the Hawaiian King Kamehameha the Great set out to build a temple (or “heiau”) on the northwestern coast of the Big Island. Puukohola hill became the location of this infamous temple, one which was to be dedicated to the gods in order to help Kamehameha unite the Hawaiian Islands. When he later accomplished this, he brought an end to centuries of warfare and established a peaceful Hawaiian kingdom. Kamehameha’s men laid the stones for the temple by hand, so the temple’s ability to stand for more than 200 years is simply remarkable, but more important is its role as a sacred place of worship for Native Hawaiians. Kalani is an educational permaculture retreat center which was established in 1975 to “connect participants with a richer sense of body-mind-spirit through communion with nature and to inspire all participants to become aloha ambassadors supportive of healthful, sustainable gardening and community living.” The property hosts group and individual retreats which focus on “blissful growth experiences” like healing bodywork, yoga, nature immersion, fresh local cuisine and other unique activities like hula, weaving and plant healing. The holistic, comprehensive approach to wellbeing at Kalani would make a fantastic experience for anyone seeking spirituality or transformation on the Big Island.  I went with SunLight on Water to swim with wild dolphins on the Kona coast, which was life-changing, as swimming with beautiful oceanic creatures often is for me. The company also offers a unique experience out to swim with manta rays. The late-night manta ray & black water dive duo offers close encounters with the massive rays as well as a front-row seat to the massive nightly ocean migration (called diurnal vertical migration) where countless deep sea creatures swim up from the bottom of the ocean to feed at the surface. These are creatures that most people will never see, but the Big Island’s unique topography allows for easy access. Seeing such unique creatures up close — ones which few people will ever get the opportunity to witness — is awe-inspiring.  While a chilled-out beach vacation is always on the docket for island visits, the Big Island of Hawaii offers so much more. The sheer size, the wildness of it and the abundance of nature and activities offer the kind of adventure travel opportunities that few places can. I hope this post gets you started on a fantastic Hawaiian adventure.  *This post was brought to you in collaboration with Alamo Rent A Car, whom I’ve partnered with in 2020 to bring you epic adventures. All love for the Big Island is my own.     Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-island-to-visit-in-hawaii/,The Best Island to Visit in Hawaii,United States,"Which island in Hawaii is the best to visit? Which one, if you’re short on time, is going to give you exactly what you’re looking for?  I’ve spent time on every visitable island in Hawaii, and the only thing I know for sure is that they’re all quite different. That’s why I’m writing this post today – because the best island to visit in Hawaii will depend on what you want to see, experience, and get out of it, and I want to help you pick.  Let’s focus on the perks, and drawbacks, of each so that you can plan the ultimate Hawaiian vacay:  The Big Island is so big, it can fit all of the other islands of Hawaii combined. It also has eight to ten of the world’s 14 microclimates, depending on which source you believe, offering an abundance of adventures no matter what your appetite may be. It’s also home to 4 of Hawaii’s active volcanoes. I love this island so much, I’m in the process of buying property there!  It’s big! It can take hours to get from one side to the other, and this is not an island you can truly “see” over the span of a weekend. To me, that makes it perfect for a road trip, but not for a quick pitstop.  Oahu is the most visited of all the Hawaiian islands, welcoming about half of the 9 million or so people who travel to Hawaii each year. Here you’ll find the state capital of Honolulu, Hawaii’s biggest city, as well as the famous Waikiki Beach. There’s a lot more to Oahu though, like famous surf breaks, the gorgeous North Shore, and lots of beautiful hiking on dramatic clifftops like Diamond Head Crater. What some people may consider an upside, others might consider a downside. If you don’t want to share your vacation with so many tourists and aren’t interested in a beach lined with high-rises, Waikiki is not going to be your cup of tea. That’s not to say that you can’t get away from it all by heading to the North Shore, or hiking Chinaman’s Hat (I know, cringe at the name! The official name is Mokoli’i meaning “Little Lizard”), but if you want something more wild, keep reading. Peanut shaped Maui brings in its fair share of visitors too, welcoming almost 3 million people in 2018. Yes, it’s touristy, but also insanely beautiful, and not as packed as Oahu. In Maui you can climb volcanoes, chase waterfalls, and snorkel the Molokini Crater. I traveled solo to Maui a couple of years ago and had a fantastic time. I can’t wait to go back! If you really want to get away from other tourists, it’s going to be difficult on Maui. Though there are all types of accommodation, Maui does cater to a higher-end traveler with a bit more money. Kauai is the fourth-most visited island in Hawaii, and also receives the most rain out of all of the Hawaiian Islands. That means that it’s quite lush and jungly, as well as waterfally (not a word, but it should be!). Though every Hawaiian island feels magical, Kauai has truly gorgeous beaches and dramatic mountains as well. Kauai is 25 miles long, with one road that runs along the coast. Word has gotten out about it’s beauty, and now it’s a popular island. That often means lots of traffic. It also has more mosquitoes than some of the other islands due to all of that rainfall. That said, most of the islands have mozzies, it’s the tropics, after all.   I love this little island! But it’s not for everyone. When you arrive on Lanai, you’ll notice that the only car rental available is a jeep, and that’s because nearly all of the roads on this island are unpaved and rugged. They are also very few places to stay, and very few other visitors as well. This is, overall, the driest of the islands, but you’re almost guaranteed to get most of your adventures all to yourself. If you want lush jungle, you won’t find it on this island. It’s dry, which means almost no mosquitoes, but also very few jungles and waterfalls. Lanai is also small, so you might run out of things to do quickly. You’ll also need an appetite for adventure, since many of the roads will be rugged. To some people this will be great, to others it will be a no-go. If you’re looking for luxury, there is a Four Seasons resort on the island, but that’s about it! The most local of the main Hawaiian Islands, Molokai also receives far fewer visitors than the other islands and will have the least touristy feel. This is not a touristy island at all, so don’t expect a lot of infrastructure or tours and hotels catering to tourists. Some people also warned me that the locals might not be all that welcoming, but I didn’t find that to be true as long as I was super friendly with them first. As they told me, it’s not that they want no tourists, they just want the right tourists. These two islands are off-limits to visitors, unless you take a helicopter ride to Niihau, or volunteer on Kahoolawe. They both have critical habitats for highly endangered species. While Niihau does have a few permanent residents, they have no roads, cars, stores, restaurants, or even electricity. Kahoolawe is the smallest of the main Hawaiian Islands, and also quite dry. It’s considered uninhabitable due to its small size and lack of fresh water. The only way to get there is to volunteer to help on large scale restoration projects. I hope that helps you pick out the best Hawaiian island for your trip. I had to reach to come up with any downsides for the islands, because all of them are fantastic and each is worth visiting. However, if you have limited time, I hope this post helps you to find the best island to visit in Hawaii for your desires. PLEASE: When traveling in Hawaii, swear off plastic. Take refillable water bottles and shopping bags, and don’t buy items that come in single use plastic, like soft drinks, fruit, etc. Hawaii no longer recycles plastic or paper! Please help keep the islands clean.  Thanks for this wonderful overview!  Which island would you recommend if we are on a budget and will be car-free? I will be with my 13 year old son who wants to snorkel?  I don’t like big cities. Hoping to visit at the end of February.  Thanks! Hmm, it’s not so easy to visit any of them if you’re car-free, but you could actually base yourself in Kona on the Big Island and take snorkeling tours. You’d just need to get a lift to the marina for some of them, or you can stay in Maui and book snorkeling tours that pick you up at your hotel.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/big-island-of-hawaii-things-to-do/,25 Amazing Big Island of Hawaii Things to Do,United States,"The Big Island of Hawaii is the largest, most diverse, and most adventurous island in Hawaii. I know that last claim might be subjective, but, to me, the rugged adventure that the Big Island presents is irresistible, considering that the Big Island (with the exception of Haleakala on Maui) is the last volcanically active island, with 10 of the world’s 14 microclimates, and large enough to fit all of the other islands combined. That’s what makes it my favorite Hawaiian island – and I’ve been to them all. After spending several weeks there, and ultimately deciding to buy property on the island (yeee!), these are the best things to do on the Big Island of Hawaii IMHO: The suggestions in this post will begin in Kona, where I assume you’ll fly into, working south from there and then back up and around the island. What better way to start your vacation on the Big Island than to swim in the bay with beautiful spinner dolphins!? I submit that there is no better way. If you find one, let me know. This is the cheapest dolphin swim trip i’ve found, and with great reviews. It’s a bit cheaper than what I booked for the same experience.   Swim with dolphins in the morning, then swim later with manta rays at night! It’s hard to think of a better, more adventurous way to spend a day. Since the dolphin swim takes place early in the morning, and the manta swim takes place after dark, it’s easy to do both in the same day and have a nice, long, relaxing afternoon. Manta snorkeling boats will attach lights to the bottom of flotation devices, which attract the plankton that the mantas eat. Watch as these gentle giants slide underneath you. I didn’t do this particular activity since I have scuba dived with many a manta ray, but take it from me, seeing a manta in person is a humbling and beautiful experience. You can book it here.  The suggestion is really not for the memorial itself, which is a monument to the first white guy who arrived and then was killed in Hawaii (who cares?). However, I mention it because this is where you can access the Kealakekua Bay. This is rumored to be the best snorkeling on the island, and in the morning, you might just see some dolphins. Getting to the bay is difficult – you can hike a good hour each way on a trail that’s hard to find, rent a kayak, which is increasingly frowned upon and only available to companies with permits (try Kona Boys in Captain Cook), or take a snorkeling tour. Because of the difficulty, I haven’t made it here yet, but it’s on my list. For those who fancy more accessible snorkeling, drive to Two Step. There is limited parking right in front of the tide pools, or a paid parking lot, which costs five dollars. Early morning is the best time to spot dolphins, although you’ll probably want some fins in addition to your mask and snorkel so that you can get out farther to where they hang out. The reef and abundance of fish are fantastic as well. Please wear reef-safe sunscreen!  Yo, it’s important to mention that currents and water on the Big Island can change quickly. Water can be rough, and people drown all around the island each year. It’s important that you refrain from going in the water if you have any doubts whatsoever. That goes for every beach on this list.  Just a stone’s throw from Two Step, this historic park has plenty of exhibits that take you through Hawaiian culture and history. It’s easy to self-navigate and takes about an hour to walk through the exhibits. Bring your National Parks Annual Pass for free entry. I loved this spot so much that I went back twice! Taking the South Point Road that most people take to go to the Papakōlea Green Sand Beach, instead of making a left where you see the painted car door that says ‘green beach’, continue straight all the way to the end of the paved road. Please do not continue beyond it, even if you see other people doing it, as there are historic artifacts and endemic plants that are trying to grow back. This area is famous for two things: a fairly tall cliff jump, and a giant ball of thousands of glittering fish for those who love free diving like I do. If you want to get into the water without jumping, head to the right of the cliff jump, and you will see some rocks that are climbable. There’s also a cave that you can swim up to, provided that the water is calm and nobody is jumping in at the same time (that said, please don’t jump into the cave, it’s likely to end in tears). Keep in mind that the current is very strong once you swim away from the cliffs, so be vigilant and only go in if the water looks good! It’s best to go on a weekday as during the weekends there are lots of fishermen and therefore hooks in the water. On a great day, though, it really is great. Not many tourists know about it, and the bait ball attracts some bigger fish as well. Keep an eye out for sharks, though. Papakōlea Green Sand Beach is hailed as one of only 4 in the world with green sand. Don’t expect to see a forest green beach — it’s more of a brownish hue — but it is pretty crazy to hold up the little grains and see that they are, indeed, green in color. The rare sand was created by the cinder cone next to the beach which was formed during an eruption almost 50,000 years ago. To get there, you can either walk for about an hour along the coast – bring sunscreen – or you can take a high clearance, 4×4 vehicle. I love my Hawaiian 4×4 adventures, but after making it halfway through, I decided to turn back because the road was truly terrible. In a rental car, I was too worried about causing issues I’d have to sort through with insurance later. That said, you can hire a local for about 20 bucks to pile you in a pickup truck and transport you, or just walk. I’d aim for the afternoon to avoid the heat. The sand looks best during golden hour, anyway. There will be fewer tourists around, too. Let’s be honest, this is a bit of a tourist trap, but if you are a big fan of Hawaiian sweet bread you might as well stop by. There’s slim pickings for food if you’re making your way over to Hawaii Volcanoes NP or Punalu’u Black Sand Beach from Kona, and it’s a long drive. The food truck across the way from the bakery has acai bowls as well as grilled steak and shrimp plates. It’s delicious! PLEASE: Bring your own cutlery or just use your hands if you eat here. They’ll give you a plastic fork and spoon and Hawaii no longer recycles plastic. Please urge them to stop using plastic as well! This black sand beach is famous for the sea turtles who come to rest on it. You’ll see plenty of Hawaiian green sea turtles in the water if it’s calm enough to snorkel. This was one of my more interesting snorkeling experiences, watching as the water got blurry while the tides mixed. It was a mix of cold and lukewarm water with lots of colorful fish, and of course, turtles. You will find that the areas where the turtles are resting are mostly roped off. Hawaiian green sea turtles are endangered and protected, so please don’t be one of those guys who sticks the camera in the turtle’s face to get a selfie, or worse, touches one trying to hitch a ride. But you’d never even think of doing that, would you? This part of the island has loads of farms that produce coffee, macadamia nuts, and even chocolate. You’ll see roadside advertisements from small, local farmers to stop in and try their offerings.  This is how I ended up spending $35 on a small bag of coffee. I have no regrets, though – it tastes like honey coffee. How do they do it!? The national park is one of the best places to visit on the Big Island for hiking, views, and otherworldly landscapes. As of the time of this writing, the lava flow, which had lasted for 35, years has stopped, so there are no active flows or lava glow at the moment. But you never know what the volcano goddess Pele might have in store! These are some of the best things to see there: You can learn more about which parts of the park are open here. The sulfur banks and steam vents are an easy loop right from the  Kīlauea Visitor Center. The whole walk is about 2 miles, give or take, depending on what you add in and cut out, and is a great spot to catch the sunset. Get there a bit earlier, at golden hour, and watch as the sun lights up the steam vents. The volcano area of the Big Island is the spot if you’re looking for unique accommodation in a lush rainforest. Picture ferns, jungle, and bird sounds. This is my favorite place to stay on the island for nature and the proximity to the national park. Plus, it’s the only spot on the island with a bunch of cool treehouses to choose from. Get a discount off of your stay on Airbnb here.  Hawaii’s Puna district is in a word, strange. There’s something to be said about choosing to live in a place that could be engulfed by lava at any moment. This is the most volcanically active part of the Big Island, and also the funkiest. But as much as I love the hippy vibe, I can’t shake the menacing undercurrent. That said, if you’re feeling open-minded, this beach is Puna in a nutshell. On Sundays, there’s a drum circle, although on any day of the week you’ll see mostly locals hanging out there with their dogs, family members, weed dealers, and even kiddos. Keep in mind that this is a nude beach, so plan on at least half of the people being naked, especially at the Sunday drum circles. Personally I love this, but I know it’s not for everyone! Swimming can be great here, but the surf can also be very rough. If you don’t see anyone in the water, maybe you shouldn’t go in either. Heading north from the beach, enjoy one of the Big Island’s most beautiful drives. You’ll see beachside mansions, evidence of a recent lava flow that took out quite a few of them, as well as rows of enchanting tree tunnels. If you must be irresponsible and stand in the middle of the road like me, make sure you don’t have any blind spots and have plenty of time to move when cars drive by! Given the 2018 lava flow, this road isn’t a loop anymore, so you’ll need to turn back and retrace your steps somewhat. It’s still worth it!  As you drive through the Big Island of Hawaii, it’ll become evident that not only do the microclimates change constantly, but also the vibe and the neighborhood. Hilo will have a more local feel than Kona, and that’s what I love about it. It’s also much more lush and jungly. There are a few places to snorkel here as well, including Richardson Beach Park and Keaukaha Beach Park, but if you’ve enjoyed Two Step and the dolphins, you might not be impressed. Food and restaurants are great, though. I particularly liked the vegan food at Vibe, poke at Suisan Fish Market, and Makani’s Magic Pineapple Shack for funky flavors. From Hilo, you don’t have to go far to reach Rainbow Falls and surrounding attractions. Depending on the water level you might be tempted to jump into the Boiling Pots as well, but would not advise it. Get ready, because this is the introduction to a very lush, waterfall-rich part of the island. This one is best reached early, since there is severely limited parking along the road at the trailhead, or you can pay to park at the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens, which gives you access to their trail, which connects with the Onomea Bay Trail. It might be worth it, considering the Onomea Bay Trail is pretty short, though it does end with a beautiful viewpoint. Perhaps the most famous and accessible waterfall on Hawaii’s northeast coast, Akaka Falls is truly stunning. It’s a short, easy walk from the parking lot, past large banyan trees and a couple of other, less amazing falls. This place is popular. I got there right when it opened at 8 AM and was able to enjoy it and have it all to myself for a little while, though. Parking is five dollars. Since Mauna Kea is currently closed, for those wishing for some stargazing, Mauna Loa might fit the bill. You can’t drive all the way to the peak, though you can park at the observatory and walk. Keep in mind this is one hell of a hike. Though mostly flat, it is long, exposed, and at altitude, and you probably will have just come from sea level. That said, just from the observatory you can also get some great stargazing. Keep in mind that this is not an astronomical observatory, but rather an atmospheric research observatory, so tours might not be that exciting. Believe it or not, the Mauna Kea volcano frequently has snow on the top! Given the tropical inversion that exists below this mountain peak (inversion keeps clouds, moisture, and air pollution down below so up at the summit, it is very dry and clear most of the time) and lack of light pollution, Mauna Kea is heralded as one of the best places on Earth for stargazing, according to people who measure such things. That has also made it a target of much controversy. For Hawaiians, this is a sacred mountain and home to the snow goddess, and recent protests have closed the summit as a battle wages over whether a 30-meter telescope will be built there or not. My vision of a better world is when our indigenous people have more rights, and I encourage anyone who visits the volcano, once it reopens, to do so with the upmost respect and consideration of the locals. As the locals on Molokai shared with me, it’s not about no tourists, but about the right tourists, enjoying these beautiful areas.  All of that said, there are multi-day hiking trails that go all along the area and, provided you practice Leave No Trace principles, I hope you get a chance to enjoy them. Multi-day hiking in cold weather is not a plan most people have for their tropical vacation, so you just might have much of the trail to yourself! Heading back to the coast, as you make your way to the northeast, you’ll drive through beautiful coastal towns, detouring from the highway to head to this lookout. It can be a great spot to catch glimpses of Maui on a clear day, and is a nice, easy pitstop for a beautiful view. If you have a 4 x 4 car, you can drive down to the bottom, or, of course, you can hike. Depending on where you’re coming from, getting to this lookout can mean driving through the gorgeous Waimea and past Mauna Kea or up from Kona through Hawi. Both are gorgeous drives, and the journey is part of the experience. Once you get to the lookout, which is in a great position for sunrise, I highly recommend hiking down to the bottom and then back up the next ridge. Depending on the trail conditions you can keep going, presumably for days, though the last time I was there the trail had been washed out in quite a few places. This is a truly beautiful way to spend a few hours! Are you aching for some white sand and a sunset view? Hapuna Beach will take you back to the west, dry side of the island for the perfect sunset.  This is a popular beach and you’ll have to pay a five dollar parking fee, but it’s well-maintained and usually is swimmable. If you have a late flight like I did and want to be able to swim and shower afterwards, Hapuna does provide outdoor showers! Please use biodegradable soap and shampoo if you plan to use them. Everything mentioned in this post is on this handy Google map: As I’m sure you’ve gathered by now, this island is huge and there’s an almost endless amount of things to do. With so much variety, give this island as much time as you can, and don’t underestimate the distances between places.  The best thing you can do is turn this into a road trip and move accommodation as you make your way around the island and if you can, give it a full two weeks. Otherwise, pick and choose the highlights that you love on this list and promise yourself you’ll go back! PLEASE: When traveling in Hawaii, swear off plastic. Take refillable water bottles and shopping bags, and don’t buy items that come in single use plastic, like soft drinks, fruit, bagged lettuce etc. Hawaii no longer recycles plastic or paper! Please help keep the islands clean.  I lived in Hawaii for 5 years and (I think?) Big Island was my favorite…Kauai is awesome too and it’s hard to choose just one since they’re so different! I loved Pu’ukohola Heiau and South Point. It’s cool to think that, while you’re standing there, you’re the southernmost person of 350ish million in the 50 US states. From a former local, great writeup of things to do! I’d recommend 2 additional things: (1) Get breakfast and a French press coffee from Splasher’s Grill in Kona. So frothy and delicious. (2) Take a Mauna Kea sunset and stargazing tour. It’s a 5-hourish trip leaving from Kona that takes you to the Mauna Kea summit with all the telescopes to watch the sunset from above the clouds followed by stargazing using super powerful telescopes (not the research ones but ones provided by the company). We saw Saturn and its rings in stunning clarity…a truly unforgettable experience. Thanks for the suggestions! When Mauna kea reopens I’d love to experience it. I’m so glad you wrote this article! This is really well put together and I truly appreciate the map. I’m headed to the Big Island for the first time in March and I will definitely be referring to this post. What time on a Sunday do they get things started with the drum circle at Kehena Black Sand Beach? I’d love to experience that.Thank you! I’m not sure when they start but it’s probably an all day, whenever it happens kind of thing.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/the-perfect-california-itinerary/,The Perfect California Itinerary,United States,"California is the best state in the US for scenery, culture, and the abundance of things to do. A bold claim, I know but as most Californians would probably agree, there’s a reason why so many of us call the Golden State home.  In this one state, bigger than many countries, we have the tallest mountain in the lower 48, one of the hottest deserts in the world, the tallest trees on planet Earth, the longest continuous stretch of general ocean coastline in the contiguous USA, and some of the most famous national parks. This California road trip begins in Los Angeles and loops around the state. Though you can easily give it months, you can easily customize it to fit whatever time constraints you have. Enjoy the journey! Start the perfect California itinerary in none other than sunny Los Angeles. The amount of time you spend here is up to you, but with countless neighborhoods and attractions to explore, you could easily spend several days here! Some cool activities include hanging out at the Santa Monica Pier, hiking to the Hollywood sign, visiting the free J. Paul Getty Museum, or Los Angeles County Museum of Art (also known as LACMA). Visit any of the countless beaches from Malibu down to Redondo Beach, or head up to Griffith Observatory (where they filmed part of La La Land!) for a beautiful sunset and panoramic views of the whole city. For a more local alternative, hike up to Runyon Canyon. Hit up Disneyland in Anaheim on your way south, or maybe even catch a concert at one of L.A.’s popular venues like the Hollywood Bowl or The Greek Theatre! Stay: Spend a night or two at Mama Shelter, an eclectic boutique hotel in Hollywood, or Freehand Los Angeles, an artsy downtown hostel with an amazing rooftop pool.  After you’re done in L.A., drive 50 miles south to Newport to spend some time on the mild beaches. Newport Beach is home to the largest recreational harbor on the west coast, which means that there are aquatic activities for days. Surf (or just watch the skilled surfers at The Wedge), stand-up paddle board, jet ski, or rent a Duffy boat to cruise around the harbor in. Hike or bike the Back Bay Loop Trail, or take the ferry to Balboa Island to explore its bistros and shops. Visit Fashion Island, which isn’t actually an island, but makes for some great retail therapy. Or, instead of exploring Newport Beach by land and sea, explore it from the air like I did with a sunset helicopter tour of Orange County!  Stay: Crash at either the charming Newport Beach Hotel or the artsy Renaissance Newport Beach! Or, if you want to camp instead, check out the nearby Crystal Cove State Park.  From Newport, cruise south 90 more miles to San Diego. Start your stay here by wandering through Balboa Park’s gardens and museums, like the Japanese Friendship Garden. Bike through Mission Bay Park and stroll down the Mission Beach Boardwalk, or take a surf lesson and catch a wave. Head to nearby La Jolla Cove to see a spectacular sunset over a gorgeous stretch of coastline, then take a trolley to the bustling Gaslamp Quarter to enjoy its restaurants, nightlife, and Victorian architecture. Foodies will love the Liberty Public Market, full of artisan cuisine and beverages, and even some boutiques and jewelry shops. Be sure to check out Little Italy, too, with its countless patio cafés, shops, and art galleries. Stay: Relax at Mission Bay’s beachfront Bahia Resort Hotel or make the chic Kimpton Hotel Palomar in downtown’s Gaslamp Quarter your home base for a day or two. If you want to camp, try Campland on the Bay.  150 miles northeast of San Diego is Slab City. Also known as “the last free place in America,” Slab City is home to a community of 150 people living “off the grid.” This is also the location of the famous Salvation Mountain art installation, created by Leonard Knight. Knight was a U.S. Army veteran who became a Christian mid-life, devoting himself to creating this massive, colorful site of devotion primarily using clay and paint. Spend a day checking out both sites. Stay: Obviously, hotels aren’t in abundance on this one, as you’re visiting a squatter community in the middle of the desert. However, if you don’t want to camp in your car, you can backtrack ten miles to the Calipatria Inn and Suites. Or, just keep going after a pit stop in Slab City and spend the night at the next destination on your itinerary.  Next up: the open California deserts — that is, if it’s not summer. Temperatures can get dangerously high in the hotter months, so be sure to keep in mind the time of year you’ll be visiting!  From Slab City, drive 100 miles around the Salton Sea to reach your first stop, Joshua Tree National Park. Continue on northeast to Mojave National Preserve (both Joshua Tree and the preserve make up the Mojave Trails National Monument), then onto Death Valley National Park. From Death Valley, drive straight west to the Alabama Hills. (If you want to hit Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, do that on your way to Slab City, as you’ll be driving right past it from San Diego.) Stay: All of these spots have abundant camping, but if that isn’t your style, stay at the 29 Palms Inn at Joshua Tree, The Oasis at Death Valley, or the Best Western Plus Frontier Motel at Alabama Hills.  After all those deserts, opt for a change in scenery by heading northwest up the Eastern Sierras to Mammoth Lakes, home to Mammoth Mountain. If you visit in the winter, snowboard and ski until your heart is content. Other times of year, enjoy water activities like boating, paddle boarding, and kayaking on the lake; do some sightseeing to check out the nearby Devils Postpile National Monument and hundred-foot-tall Rainbow Falls; and take advantage of miles of hiking and biking trails. No matter what time of year, the scenery here is unbeatable. Stay: In the warmer months, camp at Twin Lakes Campground, and in the winter, stay at Juniper Springs near the ski resort.  Drive an hour northwest to Yosemite, a place John Muir once called, “the grandest of all the special temples of nature.” The park is an amazing destination all year long, as each season brings its own unique experiences. Summer hosts the Yosemite Music Festival each July, for example, while winter means amazing hikes. The park is magical in fall and spring when it’s at its most colorful, too! At any time of year, visitors can enjoy the breathtaking views of sites like Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome, and El Capitan (all of which are visible from Tunnel View, a panoramic lookout point). A few other cool activities (there are far too many to list them all) include stargazing at Glacier Point, kayaking on Tenaya Lake, and hiking to the top of Vernal Fall. Maybe even stop by the Ansel Adams Gallery to check out some of Adams’ famous black and white photos of the park. Reaching Yosemite is easier in the summer months, because come winter, the Tioga Pass is closed. If visiting then, reverse this stop and Lake Tahoe.  Stay: Yosemite has thirteen campgrounds to choose from! If you prefer something a little more comfortable, check out the rustic and charming Narrow Gauge Inn. Cruise 125 miles north to Lake Tahoe, the biggest alpine lake in North America, which sits on the California-Nevada border.  The huge lake stretches across 22 miles, so the area is divided into North Lake and South Lake. (North Lake is known for a quieter, more locals-focused environment, while South Lake is more popular for tourism). The coolest thing about Tahoe is that it’s where you’ll find both lakeside beaches and ski resorts all in the same place. This means that Tahoe is great any time of year, as warmer weather guarantees water activities like stand-up paddle boarding, while colder weather means skiing and snowboarding! Biking is huge in Tahoe, too; you’ll find miles of both mountain biking trails and paved bike paths for casually cruising around. Tahoe also hosts lots of entertainers and festivals, so catching a cool event is always a possibility. Before you head out of town, be sure to follow the 72-mile “Most Beautiful Drive” around the lake.  Stay: Camping is abundant all the way around the lake, but some good campsites in South Lake are Camp Shelly and Eagle Point Campground. If you’d prefer to stay in a hotel, check out Hotel Azure or the Lake Tahoe Resort Hotel!  From here you’ll make the choice to either visit Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, on the western side of the Sierra Mountains, or drive the famous Pacific Coast Highway, which is where this itinerary continues. From Tahoe, cross over northwest and cut 400 miles across the state to  Humboldt via the Desolation Wilderness, a federally protected wilderness area covering more than 60,000 acres. (You’ll also pass Mount Shasta!) Once you’ve arrived at the Lost Coast, hang out for a while on an empty stretch of beach (of which there are many). Then, spend some time exploring Redwood National and State Parks: take a scenic drive (Howland Hill Road, Coastal Drive, and Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway are all great options). Watch wildlife, go for a hike, and even look for whales at any of the coastal overlooks along the park’s 40-mile stretch of coastline – and be sure to look for Hyperion, the biggest living tree on the planet! Catch a sunset at Moonstone Beach, where big rocks rising up out of the ground make for some cool photos! Stay: Stay at one of the area’s charming B&Bs, like the Shaw House Inn or the Victorian Inn. Or, camp among the towering redwoods at Humboldt Redwoods State Park.  Drive 150 miles back down south to Fort Bragg on the Mendocino Coast. Here, you can search for colorful sea glass at the aptly named Glass Beach, watch birds and seals at MacKerricher State Park, and take a kayak out on the harbor. Enjoy expansive views and empty beaches with bright blue waters, and head to the Mendocino Coast Botanical Gardens (also known as Garden by the Sea) to view gorgeous regional flora and fauna. Fort Bragg isn’t just known for its landscapes, though; downtown is home to a vibrant arts scene, visible through a mural walk and countless art galleries. You’ll find plenty of unique history here, too. In fact, there are seven museums in town, including a museum of tattoo culture! Be sure to take a ride on the historic Skunk Train, an old railroad line dating back to 1885 which runs through the tall redwoods. Stay: Spend a night or two at The Inn at Newport Ranch, a quaint, quiet little spot nestled amongst the fog. If you want to camp, MacKerricher is a great spot.  Follow the coastline south for about three hours to reach San Francisco. Some of the best things to explore here are the de Young Museum, Golden Gate Park, and the hippy Haight-Ashbury neighborhood. Check out twisty Lombard Street, then shop around Union Square in the heart of the city. Explore some of the 1,500 acres of the Presidio, or visit Coit Tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood, which offers panoramic views of the city. Alcatraz is also a unique attraction, the likes of which you won’t find anywhere else. Certain times of year are especially fun in the City by the Bay: August brings the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, late January and February host the SF Indie Fest (an independent film festival), and the Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival takes place in Japantown every April. Stay: Stay at the Palihotel San Francisco in Union Square or the quaint and historic Nob Hill Inn.  Cruise down the PCH 150 miles to reach Big Sur, which is perhaps one of the most beautiful locations in the entire state of California. Big Sur is special because it is north enough that the redwoods grow in abundance, yet still south enough that it sees better weather (warmer temperatures and less fog) than other locations of its kind. Waterfalls and cliffs, five state parks, two state reserves, and Los Padres National Forest make Big Sur a must-see. Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park and Pfeiffer Beach, with its purple-tinted sand, tide pools, and Keyhole Arch, are great places to start exploring. Visit McWay Falls, look for sand dollars at Sand Dollar Beach, go whale watching from one of the cliff-top lookouts, and be sure to drive across the picturesque Bixby Bridge, which stretches high above the coastline.  Stay: Camp along the river at the Fernwood Resort, where you can choose from traditional camping, cabins, and “glamping.” (This campsite also connects to countless beach, forest, and river hiking trails.) Ventana is also an awesome option for camping. Or, if camping isn’t your thing, check out the historic Deetjen’s Big Sur Inn. Another 200 miles down the coast gets you to sunny Santa Barbara, also known as the American Riviera. Santa Barbara is an amazing city thanks to its size (not too big, not too small), its perpetual spring weather (75 degrees and sunny a majority of the time), its beaches (abundant, clean, and beautiful) and its people (always friendly). Some of the best things to do include exploring the cool Funk Zone neighborhood, renting a bike to cruise State Street and the waterfront, hiking up in the mountains (try 7 Falls or Lizard’s Mouth), or lounging on one of the sandy beaches. Or, head to the top of the bell tower of the Santa Barbara Courthouse, where you’ll have gorgeous views of the whole city in all directions, or visit the historic Old Mission Santa Barbara. Spend an afternoon surfing or paddle boarding, then watch a vibrant sunset from the hilltops at Knapp’s Castle.  Stay: El Capitan, where you’ll likely see dolphins just off the coast, is a great camping spot in Santa Barbara. Or, try a cool hotel downtown like the Wayfarer and Hotel Santa Barbara. You did it! You made your way around the whole state! After completing the last leg of 100 miles back down the coast to L.A., you will have trekked nearly 2,000 miles around California.  Obviously, this is a pretty hefty itinerary which could take anywhere from two weeks to a month, depending on how long you stay in each location. If you can’t swing that kind of time commitment, eliminate the PCH portion and just flip the itinerary! Start from Lake Tahoe or Yosemite and work your way back down south. Here’s how to do it: You could also make more of a loop by visiting all the deserts, hitting Slab City, stopping in San Diego, driving north to Newport Beach, and finally ending in L.A. The best thing about this itinerary is that it is completely customizable!  I hope you love my home state as much as I do. There’s truly nowhere in the world like California.  Thank you for sharing the best things with us, thank you very much, your trip is also very beautiful. Glad I came across your site. Very interesting and informative.  We are planning a trip to California and wanted to take advantage of seeing some of SFO and to do the central coast road trip from SFO – LA. Our interests are photography and scenic routes along the way. Since we are are not fit enough no serious hiking but can handle flat walks. My ask is the following and hope you can help me. 1) Do you have a list of hot spots we can photograph during our trip2) Since we are planning to do over 3 days any strategic points (cities) (thinking of doing some sun rise and sun sets if possible) so that we can over night conveniently and distance wise so that we dont need to drive all day long.3) things to see in SFO as we will stay for 2 days and good spot to photograph the bridge.4) We like to see some of the red wood trees and how North we need to travel from SFO so that we can go north and come down south to LA. Any information will help us plan this well. You can see the coastal Redwoods in Big Sur between SF and LA. 3 days isn’t all that long so I’d recommend PCH (highway 1) along the coast. It’s all about the sunsets since it’s west-facing. I’d stop in Big Sur and Santa Barbara on the way down.  Baker beach is a good place to photograph the Golden Gate bridge from. Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/overtourism-in-the-u-s/,Overtourism in the U.S. –  Alternatives to 6 of the Most Popular Destinations,United States,"Overtourism is a somewhat new term these days, used to describe the influx of travelers around the globe, particularly congregating in certain spots. Unfortunately, this day in age has brought its own unique set of challenges regarding travel, and if we don’t begin focusing on the effects our travel has on the places we visit, tourism simply won’t be sustainable in many of our favorite destinations.  In 2018, the United States saw almost 80 million visitors, an all-time record, making it the third most visited country in the world. And that number only counts international tourists, disregarding the enormous part domestic travelers play in overtourism, too. The following are six of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States, paired with some fantastic spots to visit instead to help combat overtourism in the U.S.:   The way the light streams through this slot canyon has caused tourists and photographers alike to flock to Antelope Canyon in Arizona. One of the most photographed slot canyons in the world, it is estimated conservatively that 2.3 million people visited Page, AZ in 2014-2015, with almost a million (41%) visiting slot canyons like Antelope, according to statistics from a Page tourism survey from that time period. Antelope is really made up of two canyons, Upper and Lower, but both have grown in popularity so much throughout recent years that visiting is a fairly claustrophobic experience; after all, the canyon is only 8 to 12 feet wide on the ground. It is impossible to check out the canyon independently, as all visitors must go with a guided tour. The bottom line: the canyon is breathtaking, but touring it can be such a stressful experience because of the crowds and narrow spaces that it almost isn’t worth the significant sticker price of a tour.  There are actually tons of slot canyons all over the American Southwest, particularly in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. If you don’t have a 4×4 vehicle, Little Wild Horse Canyon in south-central Utah provides a viable alternative to Antelope.  You can explore it on your own, and navigating the narrow slot canyon poses an exciting adventure. Plus, the red rock here is still gorgeous, not to mention that the visit is free! In terms of independence, personal space, and affordability, Little Wild Horse is the winner.  In 2018, the island of Oahu alone accounted for half of all of Hawaii’s tourism, with close to 6 million people visiting the island, largely because of Waikiki. Beautiful though it may be, Honolulu’s Waikiki Beach might just be the most touristy spot in all of Hawaii.  Oahu’s main hotel and resort area, Waikiki has grown inauthentic too and out of touch with Hawaiian culture. Some even argue that its high-rise hotels, designer shopping, clubs, and bars make it the Vegas of Hawaii. Skip the tourist gimmicks for a more realistic (and likely more affordable) taste of Hawaiian life elsewhere.  The Big Island is certainly named appropriately, as it so dwarfs the other islands that they could all fit inside it more than 1.5 times, yet the island sees 70% fewer tourists than Oahu. Volcanoes, waterfalls, and black sand beaches spread out across eight different regions of the island make the Big Island an adventurer’s paradise.   Lanai is so infrequently visited that it’s usually not even included in mainstream tourist counts! 400 miles of unpaved four-wheel-drive trails make Lanai a great option for the traveler who wants to take the road less traveled — literally! The three regions of the island offer plenty of marine life spotting, tide pool exploring, sunset chasing, cliff chilling, beach lounging, and more. I barely saw anyone else while I was out adventuring there.  Not only does Molokai boast a three-mile stretch of white sand beach, it is home to the highest sea cliffs in the world at Kalaupapa National Historical Park. Other unique attractions include the United States’ longest continuous fringing reef, the waterfalls of Halawa Valley, and the iconic Kapuaiwa Coconut Grove. Most importantly, though, Molokai remains authentic to traditional Hawaiian culture with only two hotels on the whole island.  Recently, traffic around Big Sur has grown so heavy that locals printed and hung a banner reading “Overtourism is Killing Big Sur” on Highway 1’s famous Bixby Bridge. Frankly, they’re not wrong.  One local stated, “I’ve seen it change more in five years than in my 30 years of being here,” according to Monterey County Weekly. It is estimated that Big Sur sees nearly 6 million visitors yearly. While the area is, of course, unique for its awe-inspiring natural beauty, it is not the only coastal spot in California with oceanside cliffs and tall redwoods.   Skip the crowds of selfie-snappers and pick a different spot on the Pacific: Humboldt. One of the last truly peaceful spots of its kind, Humboldt is home to completely empty stretches of beach. In fact, the area is nicknamed, “The Lost Coast,” for its sheer lack of visitors.  Not only are the lonely beaches breathtaking, Humboldt boasts towering redwoods — some of the tallest on Earth. Miles of trails through the forest provide ample opportunity to unplug and connect with your serene surroundings.  I remember hiking Angels Landing back in 2007. I was the only one at the famous viewpoint when I made it to the end. These days, it looks quite different.  In the five years from 2008 to 2013, the number of visitors to Zion National Park increased by 117,000 people. In the five years from 2013 to 2018, the number increased by 1.5 million. The numbers speak for themselves, pointing to overtourism above all else. Zion sees more tourists per year than Yosemite, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, or Glacier.  Of course, the park is popular for a reason, as the challenging hikes lead to breathtaking views, but the official park isn’t really to thank for the natural beauty: the state is! Utah’s stunning red rock formations don’t exist solely at Zion, and there are countless other places throughout the state to take in the gorgeous scenery without the absurd crowds.  One of these lesser-visited places is Canyonlands National Park in southeastern Utah. In 2018, Canyonlands saw roughly 740,000 visitors — that’s a little over fifteen percent of the tourism Zion sees. It also covers a huge area of land, so you don’t have to share the trails with too many other visitors.  While there, catch a sunrise at Mesa Arch (fair warning, this is the park’s most popular feature and is very popular at sunrise), head to Needles Overlook, and check out The Loop, which, interestingly enough, is reminiscent of Arizona’s Horseshoe Bend. Or, hike throughout the park for amazing views without the hoards of photo-takers you would encounter at Zion!  Key West, the southernmost island of the Florida Keys, is a popular cruise ship stop, vacation spot, and snorkeling destination. The island only covers an area of 7 square miles, which simply is not enough space to accommodate the several million tourists which visit it every year. 2013 brought 2.7 million visitors to Key West, and for an island with a local population of approximately 25,000, that equates to more than 100 times as many tourists as actual residents. (To put that in blatant terms, that’s like each Key West local having to host 100 visitors over the course of the year — no thanks!) 379 cruise ships stopped at Key West in 2018 alone.  The reality is that Key West locals are sick of the absurd number of tourists, and the tourists themselves are sick of annoying crowds and the tired old tourist traps on the island.  St. Augustine, a city on the northeastern coast of Florida, is the oldest city established by settlers in the U.S. and North America, dating back to 1565. It certainly has the Spanish colonial architecture to back it up. The city is home to multiple historic landmarks, but more than that, the beautiful beaches make it a great alternative to Key West. Oceanfront restaurants, outdoor activities galore, and lots of sunshine are sure to make a great Florida vacation.  Siesta Key is a small barrier island off the central western coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2017, TripAdvisor named the island’s main beach, Siesta Beach, the best in the United States, and it came in at #2 the following year. The accolades can be attributed to clear turquoise waters and a huge stretch of pure white sand which never gets too hot. Ditch the traditional Florida Keys for a different Key: Siesta Key!  Southwest of Fort Myers, Sanibel Island boasts beautiful sunsets, a wildlife refuge, state parks, and countless outdoor activities – including sailing! The island is also adjacent to Captiva Island, making it a perfect spot to go island hopping. The islands offer miles upon miles of gorgeous beaches and bike paths, as well as ample opportunity for kayaking and stand-up paddle boarding. You can even go beachcombing on Travel & Leisure’s top rated beach for shells! Ah, good old New York City — the most popular tourist destination in the entire United States. The city saw a whopping 65 million visitors in 2018. (To put that into perspective, NYC alone saw twice as many tourists as the entire country of Greece.) If that isn’t overtourism, I don’t know what is!  To be fair, New York is probably one of the greatest cities in the world for its diversity, arts & culture, food scene, creative opportunities, and overall intrinsic spirit, but a lot of other cities offer those same things. Sometimes it feels like people choose to visit The Big Apple simply because it’s, well, The Big Apple, without much thought to anything other than New York’s “must-do” status. Looking for city life that’s a bit more bite-sized? Head over to Providence, Rhode Island, which was was founded in 1636 and therefore has much of that old-school charm that NYC is so famous for. Eight universities throughout the city mean that Providence is full of young people and a major hub for arts and culture. Lots of shopping, glamorous hotels, a buzzing and diverse food scene, and cool events year-round make Providence a fantastic alternative to New York.  Roger Williams Park — 435 acres including Victorian gardens — even acts as the Providence equivalent to Central Park! “Providence combines the friendliness of a small town with the culture and sophistication of a big city,” states Visit Rhode Island, which explains why Providence made the top five in Travel & Leisure’s “America’s Favorite Cities 2016. Meanwhile, as Maine’s largest city, Portland has a lot to offer. From hundreds of independent stores to shop through to year-round farmers’ markets offering fresh local produce, this seacoast town has a cosmopolitan persona big enough to rival most large cities — even New York. Named one of the “The Best Cities for Food in the United States” in 2016, Portland has a diverse culinary scene which focuses on sustainable local seafood and farm-to-fork principles.  What’s more, restored historic buildings and art galleries scattered throughout town add character to this already charming New England gem. Like NYC, Portland boasts tons of unique neighborhoods, including its Arts District and Old Port Historic District. Interestingly, Portland excels most where New York lacks: in its seaside culture. The nearby beaches are superb!  The reality is that we all must become mindful travelers who care about the ways in which we enjoy the privilege of seeing the world. And sometimes, that means taking a rain check on a popular destination in favor of an alternative for the sake of both the destination and our own travel experience.  Still dying to see these popular spots? Consider going during the off-season, if there is one, or make it a quick stop before exploring the other destinations on this list more thoroughly. Besides, it’s way more fun when you don’t have to share it with crowds!  What are some of your favorite underrated places in the USA? I have to say I disagree that anything substitutes for New York. There’s just nothing like that city, as over-touristed as it is. From Broadway to street food, summer parties to cultural events — nowhere else can replicate the ever-present energy in the air. I say this as someone who’s actually sick of NY, having lived here the longest of my adult life (I’ve previously lived in Lagos, DC, San Francisco, and London and have spent a lot of time in cities like Tokyo, Austin, LA, and many others) That said, I agree with the overall advice to explore other less popular destinations, as I do think there’s some magic to be had no matter where you go. Love your blog and appreciate all of your great and really thoughtful content. Agreed. Nowhere can really replace anywhere else. Glad you enjoy the blog! I agree that there isn’t a substitute for NYC, but if going in that direction, it isn’t the end all, be it all. You can enjoy NYC but save time for beautiful southern New England including central and eastern Long Island, New Haven (CT), Providence (RI), and southern New York State, as well as Cape Cod and of course, Boston (MA) and Portland (ME).  In terms of alternatives or additions, here are some.1. Minneapolis is great, but don’t forget St. Paul! It has lots to offer plus is the state capital!2. Portland, OR is great, but don’t forget Salem and Eugene and explore the coast where the mid-latitude rainforest meets the Pacific (if can get that rare sunny day, June is best bet, well it IS a rainforest :))3. Myrtle Beach, SC, but if not with family, try Wilmington Beach, NC or even further northeast along the NC coast!4. Atlantic City, NJ, if not into gambling, try Ocean City, NJ or if want quieter, lots of choices further south on Jersey shore, like Cape May!5. Helen, GA or Pigeon Forge/Gatlinburg, TN:  If live in the area, experience these places once. But then spend the rest in locations like Cashiers, NC, Clayton, GA or Townsend, TN6. Your suggestion Kristin from previous post: San Francisco for sure, but don’t forget Oakland!7. Philadelphia has history and activity: But don’t miss nearby Wilmington, DE, the Brandywine Valley&Creek I also think Providence, RI (and all of Rhode Island for that matter) is a great addition to your trip to Boston, MA. I am planning to do that trip next time I am in Boston. Providence and the state has a unique history because Rhode Island was a virtual utopia of religious tolerance, centuries ahead of its time. It is the smallest state, but had the biggest heart.  Hope these are useful to people!  I think it is great that Kristin is suggesting alternatives to parks in the West that can give you the same kind of experience without the crowds and likely doing less harm to the area! Kristin, do you have a good alternative to Yellowstone NP? It is a big caldera which is hard to imitate with geysers, but was wondering because that gets pretty crowded and already have been! You did mention neat places in Montana in a past post up north near Canada, but wondering specifically in this area. (Wyoming, southern MT, east-most ID). Thanks!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/vietnam-packing-list/,The Best Packing List for Vietnam,Vietnam,"Vietnam is beautiful, delicious, and a lot of fun to travel in. This coastal country is hot and humid in the south, and sometimes cold and foggy in the north, which may sound tricky to pack for – but don’t worry!  This packing list will help you pack light and right for your trip, from picking out the right gear to bringing the right amount of clothes: While you can expect the typical Southeast Asia weather (read: hot and humid year-round) in central and southern Vietnam, up north in the mountains, bordering China, Vietnam can get pretty cold, especially at night.  The rainy season typically lasts from May to October, though it rarely rains all day long. Stick with breezy, lightweight clothing, but bring along a good jacket if you plan to venture up north.  Vietnam is one of the main manufacturers for international clothing and outdoor brands like GAP, Columbia, The North Face, and so on. The local fashion scene also gets pretty cute, so leave some space in your luggage to do some shopping. They are the most practical souvenirs, anyway. The only things that can be hard to find locally are shoes and underwear if you wear a larger size. However, if you make it to Hoi An, you can get just about any pair of shoes or outfit custom-made! I know many people get anxious about packing for a trip, like, what if I didn’t bring enough underwear, or did I forget to pack my toothbrush, etc? While Vietnam isn’t exactly shopping paradise, you can easily find a replacement if you left anything at home. You can buy clothes for cheap, and there are plenty of supermarkets and local stores selling toiletries and electronic gadgets. The only things you do not want to forget are these essentials: Backpacking in Vietnam requires a lot of walking. In the main cities like Ho Chi Minh, there are many tiny alleyways that buses and cars cannot get through, so you often have to carry your luggage and walk some distance. On buses and trains, your luggage may be shoved with others to make space. You’d want a backpack that’s sturdy and comfortable! There are also some organizing and anti-theft gear that will give you peace of mind: The key to packing light is to pack enough clothes for a week, regardless of how long the trip is. Doing laundry is very cheap in Vietnam, but I’d keep my favorite clothes at home so I don’t risk ruining them! Covering up is required when visiting temples, and the locals generally dress modestly, so keep that in mind when picking out your clothes: I bring pretty much the same toiletries everywhere. When traveling in Southeast Asia, consider ditching the makeup and embracing your own skin. It’s going to be so hot and humid, your makeup isn’t going to last, anyway! Everything on this list, except for the razor, is environmentally friendly: Photography is a huge part of my travels, so I almost always have my full gear with me. Depending on your personal preference and usage, you may have more or less electronic gadgets to pack. Here’s what I suggest for Vietnam: Here are a few things that may slip your mind, but definitely good to have: I hope this packing list helps to simplify your packing process for your trip to Vietnam!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cost-of-traveling-in-vietnam/,Tips From the Banker: The Real Cost of Travel in Vietnam,Vietnam,"Perhaps you’ve heard that traveling in Vietnam can be quite cheap.  Perhaps you’ve heard that the country can be seen for around the holy grail of $30 per day.  Perhaps you’ve heard you can eat, sleep, and explore it quite well on a very limited budget. I’m here to say that you heard correctly.  After two particularly painful months (for my wallet) in Sri Lanka and then the Philippines, I was ready to go back to my cheap backpacker ways, endeavoring to spend as little as possible while having the most enriching travel experience possible.  I’m so happy to say that in Vietnam, this is entirely possible. The average I spent in Vietnam per day was $36 This was during the Tet (Lunar New Year) holiday when all busses and trains doubled in price.  Therefore, one could travel in Vietnam for even less at any other time of year. That said, Tet was a wonderful time to be in Vietnam, and celebrating with locals, eating meals and drinking around the fire with them made it all that much better. Here’s my breakdown of the cost of travel in Vietnam:  Accommodation is nice and cheap in Vietnam. There are dorms available just about everywhere, and it’s almost a guarantee that they provide fast internet, nice, warm showers, and often a cooked-to-order breakfast is included (as long as you wake up before 10am). I spent an average of $7 on dorms and shared rooms while in Vietnam.  Some were closer to $10, and some were closer to $5.  I was very pleased with the quality and cleanliness for the money I paid. Hostels in Ho Chi Minh City: $4-$10 (book your hostel in Ho Chi Minh here) Hostels in Hanoi: $4-$11 (book your hostel in Hanoi here) Hostels in Hoi An: $5-$10 (book your hostel in Hoi An here)  Be sure to download the Grab app on your phone! It works exactly the same as Uber, except that Uber is no longer available in Southeast Asia. Grab bikes are incredibly cheap and reliable, just be ready for the adrenaline rush when riding on in Ho Chi Minh City, as the bike zooms through what seems like millions of other bikes and cars. Taxis are pretty reasonable when they have to be taken.  By going with trustworthy companies like Vinasun or Mailinh, which don’t fix their meters to cheat unsuspecting tourists, and always insisting on a meter, they never cost too much. Overnight buses and trains wouldn’t have been too bad if it weren’t for the Tet holiday.  In some cases, they cost almost double.  When possible, book directly instead of through your guest house, which definitely takes a (in some cases hefty) commission if they book for you.  In Ho Chi Minh City, this means going directly to the Futa bus office in Pham Ngu Lao area and booking with them, even if you don’t intend to leave for a few days. An 8-hour bus ride costs about $10, which is pretty reasonable.  This must be the single best part of Vietnam.  I could easily get by on $1.50 on a lunch or dinner of street food, generally consisting of soup, fresh spring rolls, rice with various accompaniments, or noodles with meat. Sometimes I had the best food by just playing street food roulette, meaning I had no idea what I was ordering, but if there were lots of locals eating there, it was typically a good sign. A favorite of mine was the street soup vendor in Hoi An who shouted, “Vietnam!” at me when I walked by, followed by the biggest smile and most gleeful laughter I’ve ever heard, so clearly I had to eat there! I ended up with a soup with rice noodles, cilantro, amazing broth, and a whole shank of pork for $1.50. Then there were the soup ladies who would come over and add various things to my soup if they observed I wasn’t eating it right.  It made me feel looked after. A generally good rule of thumb is to go to places that don’t have an English menu, are full of locals, and don’t have tablecloths.  Bonus points if the food is served on the street! Can we also talk about the coffee? Vietnamese coffee is amazing, and typically only $1.  It’s made with very strong coffee, sometimes mixing up to five different varieties, then mixed with sweetened condensed milk. Yum! Almost everywhere was pretty cheap.  Ho Chi Minh City might have been the best overall deal, with really delicious street food and reasonably tasty beer for only 50 cents.  I really have no complaints! The most expensive place was Hanoi, where I spent more like $2-3 on meals instead of my usual $1.  However, I quickly found the cheaper food and coffee by heading out of the tourist areas and opening my eyes a little more to the nondescript places.  Even though Hanoi was a little more expensive, it’s still amazingly cheap and easy to enjoy on a budget, and was a city I really enjoyed spending time in. SIM cards with data are also ridiculously cheap.  One can get a month of data for only $5, along with some calling minutes and texts.  It’s almost silly not to get a SIM when in Vietnam.  Viettel and Mobi-Fone are great companies with great coverage and can be found in any city, and are topped up easily. Beer is very cheap and pretty tasty at around 50 cents to one dollar each. Let’s not forget the amazing cheap custom clothing and shoes that they make in Hoi An as well! It’s also very easy to find other travelers to split various costs with, which makes things all that much easier if, like me, you’re a solo traveler.  I almost never had to shoulder the cost of a taxi or shared car by myself.  In fact, I was never alone in Vietnam, which was really nice after some lonely days in the Philippines. All in all, I love this country, the cheap eats, and the wonderful sights.  Go there. I had heard Vietnam was cheap, but not THAT cheap! Wow! I would love to get a meal for $1.50…things are so expensive here in the Caribbean. Vietnam is one of the cheapest places I’ve been, and not only that, the value for the money is amazing. $36 is still a little bit more than we spent in Vietnam. For us it was around $15-$20, but we shared the cost of accommodation and food so it was cheaper for us! Great job! If it hadn’t been Tet I would have spent a lot less. Thanks Kristin. This is super handy as I’m flying into Hanoi this weekend! Great that you’re drinking green tea. I loooove it! Make sure you get to the tea villages in Hangzhou if you’re working your way near Shanghai Thanks Jimmy! I have no idea what I’ll have time for since I spent almost a full month in Yunnan. I move too slowly to get China seen in just two months! I think it is amazing how people can get by by only eating street food, something that most middle-class Brazilians I know would never do.  Btw, have you been gotten food poisoning? It’s one of the fears I have. I’ve never (knock on wood) had food poisoning. I think most people get some stomach issues when coming to a new part of the world, eating the food, and getting used to the different bacteria. It’s inevitable.  I love street food and trust it because they cook it right in front of me. I don’t eat things that have been sitting out and aren’t cooked fresh, though. My problem with street food in Asia isn’t really the quality, it’s the quantity. Sure you can get a meal for $1 or 2 but I would have to eat again an hour later! Everyone I know who’s visited Vietnam – and that’s quite a few – has gotten sick (presumably food poisoning) – it’s kind of a rite of passage. Kristin sounds like a lucky and rare example 🙂 But you can buy TWO meals for only $2! Variety is the spice of life 🙂 We spent similar amounts to you (though of course I track in NZ dollars). My partner was sick for most of Vietnam and consequently we started spending more on food as he became quite wary of street food. Uh oh 🙁 A few times I’ve had an upset stomach.  Not full on food poisoning – but I’ve had to put myself on on a rice and bread diet until it got better. Definitely loving China and happy to report that it’s definitely cheap in Vietnam! Thanks for the great write up. We just got to Vietnam and are looking forward to getting back on budget. Unfortunately it seems like every time we turn around there are experiences we want to spend a lot of money on. Like diving in Thailand, and kite-surfing in Mui Ne. It’s always tough to find the balance between staying on budget and not turning down the experiences we are out traveling the world for! I think it always comes down to saving when it does not matter, and splurging for the experiences that do matter. It’s nice when you find that sometimes saving can mean better experiences than splurging, like with food or accommodation options. I completely agree and struggle with the same thing. I always pay up for diving, though. I love it so much and, as you said, it’s the reason why I’m traveling. I’m not going to deny myself the things I came out here to see! That’s why it’s so nice that Vietnam is cheap. You can eat and sleep cheaply and splurge on things like kite surfing 🙂 My apologies if you’ve already mentioned it in another post, but where did you go kitesurfing, and did you do any diving while in Vietnam? If so, where was the best place? I didn’t kite surf. I had a shoulder surgery a couple of years ago and, though it’s probably totally fine, I really don’t want to push it and re-injure myself, so I stay away from things that will pull heavily on the tendons. You can go to Mui Ne, though. It’s known for it.   Diving is not good in Vietnam. I didn’t waste my money. I assumed you did since you used it as a splurge example. In that case, were there any good dive places in Vietnam you would recommend? Ah, a lot of people do so I used it as an example. I really don’t think the diving is good in Vietnam. I’d save your money on that! I enjoyed Vietnam when I was there… food is cheap, taxis are cheap, accomodation is cheap, massages are cheap, coffee is amazing, food is great! (missing my paper wrapped spring rolls and Hue style noodles now…)  Only thing I really didn’t like was the huge amount of air pollution due to the scooters everywhere…HCMC and Hanoi are quite walkable but you have to really do it with a mask for sure! I’m writing this comment to you from China, where the pollution in Hanoi and Saigon seems like a fresh spring breeze in comparison! It’s so bad here. Yes, good luck with that nasty air pollution in China. I lived in Shanghai last year and most days out of the year you need to be wearing a 3M mask. Locals will not wear them but they don’t seem to understand the health effects, yet. A real 21st century problem. Cannot compare it to UK/USA now, or even years ago. The scale is enormous. Can’t wait to get through Vietnam! Thanks for this. 😉 Helpful blog.  I’m glad it’s inexpensive there, that should make up for the expensive flight. Hi Kristin,  Thanks for sharing! I will be traveling to Vietnam in December and I was wondering if you booked your Hostel stays in advance (a few days before arriving)? I’m in the midst of planning the trip, but I don’t know if I should pay for the hostel stays now. Thanks in advance!  Dana I keep my plans fluid but around holidays at least give it a few days if not weeks in advance. did you do your homestay during tet? what about halong bay? I’m visiting next January, I’ll arrive 4 days before the start of tet and I’m nervous that I won’t be able to do any of the things I want to do. Any tips would be welcome. I was in Hoi An during Tet and went north right after. That was actually a great way to do it! I don’t know if Halong Bay is still going on the day of but leading up to it you should be able to. Hi Kristin your story is very inspiring. I’m planning a backpacking trip for my daughter and I in Southeast Asia. How do you financially support your travels? I fund my travels through my blog and associated activities 🙂 Great information! It’s always nice to learn about different ways to experience Vietnam. So interesting to read about your experience with the price differences in Saigon and Hanoi. Thanks for sharing! Hi Kristin, love your blog, very practical and gets the mind wandering 🙂 I also like the insightful posts you have shared about life on the road, relationships and finding yourself.This has gotten me planning a trip to Vietnam so thanks for the costs breakdown!I’ve only used hostels in Europe, so I was wondering if you have any tips on managing those and staying safe? I love the suggested equipment list, but for example would you recommend keeping passport and card on you at all times or leaving it in your bag in the hostel? (assuming there is no safe).Did you ever blog about these topics? couldn’t seem to find it!thanks and keep on inspiring us 🙂Filippo Glad you like the blog and what you’re finding on here! In Vietnam the hostel is required to keep your passport at the front desk, but otherwise I lock mine up in the wire mesh bag protector mentioned in the gear lists. That’s where I keep everything if they don’t have individual lockers. Hope that helps! hello. thanks for your travels  Ha   wanting to go to vietnam, my only question is about my money  what do i do with it where to put it   say, i have a thousand dollars   i would’t feel safe walking around with it  and i would not like knowing its back in my room etc etc     is there a safe place  no pun intended   leaving it under my pillow   well it’s just not right.     Thanks  keith I would not suggest traveling around with a thousand dollars at any point, anywhere. I tend to just withdraw what I need from the ATM and repeat as needed. However most hostels do have lockers and in the case that they don’t, I like to use the wire mesh bag protector: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/packing-for-southeast-asia/ We would like to do Vietnam Cambodia and China in 2 weeks. 2 adults 2 children. Is this something that’s safe and do able with children. Looking to do it cheap  and experience it properly. I guess that’s up to you but I would do it.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/backpacking-vietnam-route/,The Ultimate Backpacking Vietnam Route Planner,Vietnam,"Vietnam is an essential stop for most people who are backpacking across Southeast Asia. If you want a destination where your money will go far, and where you can get access to jungles, history, beaches, and gorgeous natural areas with ease, then Vietnam is an excellent choice. Vietnam is also very special when it comes to food. It’s interesting to see the way that it changes from region to region, and yet how cheap and delicious it is, and generally healthy too! Here’s my guide to many of the best spots in Vietnam, in the direction that I took from South to North. This can easily be reversed if you’re coming from the other direction: Whenever I see a stop motion film or time lapse of Ho Chi Minh City I’m reminded of how crazy it was simply to cross the street there. Everything seems to run in a sort of organized chaos of motorbikes and roundabouts in a city that still has some hints of French colonialism in the architecture and even in the food (Banh Mi in a French roll, anyone?). Formerly Saigon, Ho Chi Minh City is a very common first stop in Vietnam. For me, it was primarily a foodie adventure and my introduction to Vietnamese cuisine, which must be some of the freshest, most flavorful, and light food I’ve ever tasted. Apart from stuffing one’s face, there’s a lot of history to explore especially for those interested in visiting the Củ Chi tunnels and the War Remnants museum. Both activities help to give a better understanding of the Vietnam of today. Stay: Townhouse 50 – walkable to the backpacker area but a nicer part of town, with included breakfast! Beware: bag snatch thieves are all over HCMC, particularly in the backpacker area. Never take your phone out on the street and if you are walking with a bag, make sure that it has a strong strap it is not easy to slash or you could become a target. I just took my money out in a pocket that buttoned when I left for the evenings so that I wasn’t an attractive target without a bag or a phone. Mui Ne is a higher end beach destination with oceanfront resorts. It’s a popular spot for kite surfers and has sand dunes to play in as well. This is a resort town with less of the debauchery that you’ll find in Nha Trang. If you’re looking for a spot to unwind, Mui Ne is one of the nicer beachy areas in Vietnam. Stay: Mui Ne Bay Resort Beautiful and quirky Da Lat is actually an area where you will find more Vietnamese than Western tourists. It’s a popular local spot which is part of what makes it so cool. The town has great night markets, and an especially festive atmosphere if visiting around lunar new year. The monastery and elephant falls excursions are must-dos. More on how to do them here. This is another popular beach destination but though it tends to have more of a party vibe. There are some nice beaches around Nha Trang, but for the most part I thought it was a pretty touristy, somewhat seedy alternative to the much nicer Mui Ne and Hoi An. Stay: Mozjo Inn has the friendliest staff and it’s a fun place to meet other backpackers to head to the beach with. I ended up at this park simply because I wanted to find one place in Vietnam that was truly off the beaten path. I can say that Yok Don fits the bill, and receives very few tourists each year. It’s a little tricky to get to, but once you do you can get some peace and solitude away from the backpacker crowd and much of anything at all! Stay: The accommodation is tied to the park, so ask in the HQ when you arrive. It is slightly expensive for a solo backpacker, so bring a friend!   Hoi An is my personal favorite city to visit in Vietnam because for me it’s a triple threat – it’s photogenic, it’s on the beach, and I can get custom made clothes and shoes there. What’s not to love? Apart from wandering around the old town, checking out the Chinese temples and getting awesome handbags, suits, rompers, dresses, and shoes made, you can enjoy some rest and relaxation as well as this spot is much less crowded than Hanoi or Saigon. Click for different accommodation options in Hoi An depending on your budget. There are some beautiful options! While Hoi An was my favorite city, Phong Nha is my favorite non-urban area in Vietnam. The undulating, unique rock formations and the idyllic rice patties all around this tiny little town just makes it all so dreamy. The locals were friendly and welcoming, flashing peace signs, and there were caves to play in and swim in too. It’s a little slice of paradise. Not as many backpackers make it here, and that has made all the difference in a positive way. If you love nature, definitely stop in this park, rent a motorbike for a few days, and go have adventures. More on how to do that here. Hue primarily entered my itinerary because of bun bo Hue, a soup I was very keen to try. What I found was a quiet city (mostly because it was just after Tet, or Lunar New Year), full of ancient history. It was almost haunting in a way. I didn’t stay for long, but I highly recommend Jodi’s guide to anyone looking for more on Hue and what to eat there. My favorite memory of and Hanoi circled around Cafe Giang where I tried the famous Hanoi egg coffee. Please, if you find yourself there, stop everything you’re doing and head to this café. I know it sounds like a gross concoction but egg coffee is like a Cadbury creme egg and a cup of coffee met in heaven and spawned a beautiful love child. Apart from that, Hanoi is known for its is shopping in both high end shops and excellent markets all around town, and its interesting mix of East and West as the French influence is also still present in the quaint tree-lined city streets and old buildings. It’s also the jumping off point for Halong Bay and Sapa in the north. Stay: Little Diamond Hotel All around Hanoi, you’re bound to see signs advertising 2-3 day trips out to Halong Bay, famous for the magical landscape of limestone rocks shooting right up out of the bay’s waters. The trips usually involve at least one night on the boat and one on an island, and can vary in luxury and price point. The party option is the Castaways Tour which is more of a booze cruise than nature excursion. For something higher end, visit a few tour operators in Hanoi and see who can give you the best price on the tour that suits your desires best. Get a few different prices and negotiate. Spending the night in a Hmong village in Sapa is kind of a must when in Vietnam. It’s a chance to get a local experience as well as seeing some of the most beautiful rice paddies in Vietnam. I went with a group of 14 other backpackers, taking the overnight bus up from Hanoi. We did a hike, had a few meals around a camp fire, and enjoyed an overnight in the home of our host in the rural area around Sapa. More on how to book here. Phu Quoc is an island in the South of Vietnam, closer to Cambodia. I haven’t been, which is why I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it. However, I want to add it here because it’s apparently very laid back, and probably has the best beaches in Vietnam. Judging how close it is to Cambodia and how incredible that coastline is, if you have time, add it to your itinerary (then please come back and comment on your experience!). Here’s a map to help you plot your points. Actual travel time will be much longer on buses, motorbikes, and trains, but this can give you a sense of distances:  Getting in: Vietnam requires that most tourists have a visa. For Americans and most other nationalities, the best way is to obtain the 30-day visa ahead of time in the capital city of a nearby country at the Vietnamese embassy or consulate. You can also buy a visa online (I used myvietnamvisa.com), print the approval letter, bring along passport sized photos, and pay a $45 stamping fee when you arrive. Definitely bring USD to pay the fee, as any other currency will cost more! The ATM in the airport also rarely works. Transport-wise, there are several easy ways to get around Vietnam: Vietnam is an adventure, and it can be a ton of fun and delicious too. Plus, with the ease of getting around and the cheapness of the country for visitors, it’s a no-brainer for those backpacking around Southeast Asia. Great post and photos!This reminded me of our 2+ months backpacking through Vietnam back in 2014 – I’d love to return.  I would definitely add Ninh Binh, it is the perfect chillout place only a couple of hours away from Hanoi…it’s known as Halong Bay on the rice paddies…without all of the tourists. I love this guide and the one you posted on Thailand a few days ago! I’m planning a long-term Asia trip with my boyfriend for next year and these guides will definitely be coming in handy! 🙂 Awesome! Is there any other info you’re looking for an not finding? I’m happy to make more! I came here to look at the pictures and to see if you had the same itinerary as I did, haha. I would also add Tam Coc, if you liked Nha Trang it’s a very similar environment with boat tours in the river and ancient heritage sites to explore on a motorbike, it was one of my favourite places in Vietnam. (I also went to Phu Quoc and it rained heavily the whole time. FML.) Also about the visas: a lot of nationalities now can get in for 14 days without a visa, but unfortunately I don’t think that includes Americans – and who wants to only spend two weeks in Vietnam anyway?? I overlanded from Cambodia and to avoid the embassy hassle I paid an agency in Phnom Penh (recommended by my hostel) 50 dollars and they had the visa ready in a day. In my opinion that’s the easiest way to do it if you’re taking a bus into Vietnam. Not sure if you knew these things already, but thought I’d put in my two cents 🙂 Vietnam often plays second fiddle to Thailand, but it seems there’s enough to do here to fill an entire trip by itself! I like the idea of Vietnam because the route is a straightforward north-south line lol, so there’s no question where to go next. Lol I like that too. I found Vietnam to be a little bit less touristy The sand dunes in Mui Ne are beautiful; they remind me of La Guajira in Colombia where the desert meets the sea. Asia is such a diverse continent – I loved Hong Kong but am itching to visit Vietnam. This is a very helpful post! When do you think is the best time to visit Vietnam? any and all times but I thought it was particularly pretty and festive during Tet (lunar new year) Great post!  I love Vietnam and the food is simply amazing everywhere!   Backpacking Vietnam is easy and safe.  We did the reunification express train and took our time going north to south which stopped by some of the places you mention.  We however liked Nha Trang mostly because we are SCUBA Divers and the diving is decent there.   Agree with Hoi An of course.  We stayed at Cat Ba island in Halong Bay.  Great place to stay, cheap cheap cheap and you can get on junks to tour the bay easily without booking from some weird Hanoi travel agency brochure that misrepresents the tour. LOVE that suggestion for Halong Bay! Thanks so much and I need to stay there next time! Hello Kristin,  Thank you very much for taking the time and effort to share such amazing details.I am planning my first solo backpack trip to Vietnam and i am following your blog as a Bible for my trip.I would really appreciate your help in planning my trip further, I think you were on a long trip, i have just  9 days to explore the entire country, i will reach Hanoi and leave from Ho Chi Minh.Can you please suggest which places should i go and which i can miss.I also wanted to know how to go from Halong Bay to Nha Trang or Hoi An.Thank you Hmm, definitely see Hoi An. You’ll want to break it up anyways with a stop in the middle. You can take overnight trains in order to help save time as well. I couldn’t do trains because it was Tet so they were booked up, but any other time of year it should be possible. I did overnight buses which aren’t as much fun, but still get the job done. Halong Bay takes at least 2-3 days, and usually people do tours that bring them from Hanoi up there and back down. I thought it was just OK even though yes, it’s pretty. I loved Phong Nha the most, but that’s just because I love small villages when I travel. If you can go there, do it! Thank you very much Kristin.You are very very kind.I feel motivated to goI am going next week. Dear Kristin, this is what my temporary itinerary looks like, would be really grateful if you could go through it and give your suggestions. Day 1 HanoiDay 2 Halong BayDay 3 Halong BayDay 4 Travel by train to Hoi AnDay 5 Hoi AnDay 6 Da LatDay 7 Mui NeDay 8 Ho Chi MinhDay 9 Return The problem is taking into account how much travel time is between those places on the chance that you can’t always take an overnight train (plus, you’ll be exhausted). You’ll end up with just a few hours in each spot. I’d remove Da Lat and Mui Ne and give yourself more time in Hoi An so you don’t feel like you’re always on the move. Or, I’d scrap heading south of Hoi An altogether, unless you fly out of Ho Chi Minh. It’s just a lot to try to do in one week. Thanx Kristin…. taking into account your suggestions….i have slightly altered my itinerary..i am flying to Da Nang  from Halong Bay instead of taking the train…also I am planning just a day tour to Halong Bay instead of staying there for 2 days…If I had to choose between Dalat and Mui Ne…which one would you you suggest? Depends on what you want. Mui Ne is beaches and sand dunes and Da Lat can actually feel cold, and is more mountainous and has a very local feel. HI Kristin, love your blog: very inspirational and since i’m going to Vietnam soon I’m going through all these older posts again 🙂I had a question I hope you could help me with.I’m effectively backpacking north to south and will end up in HCMC where I’ll also go to the mekong delta.After that I’m planning to go to Phu Quoc to finish off the trip. unless I decide to stay in Phu Quoc for longer, I have a couple extra days to potentially spend around HCM. How many days would you recommend spending in HCM? I’m also considering going to Vung Tau for a day or so, but have heard mixed opinions. is there anything else worth exploring in the Area for a day or 2? many thanks! A lot of people go to the Chu Chi tunnels outside of HCMC. If you’re a foodie you could explore it endlessly. Jodi is my guru for that https://www.legalnomads.com/saigon-street-food/ Hey Kristin…I never thank you enough, I just came back from my first solo backpack trip to Vietnam and I cant describe in words how amazing it was and you are largely responsible for it. Thanx to you and your blogs, I had a fair idea of where I had to go and what I was doing.You inspired and influenced me in a way I’ll never forget. Lots of people helped in making this possible but you my friend were the first one, your blogs were my window into an unknown country.Hope to meet you some day.God bless youThank you once again Hi Kristin,I am planning for Vietnam from february 5 or 6th , for 20 days.I have read your  blog ( and Others) and this is what I have so far HCMC 2 daysCha Tho, delta of Mekog 3 days (this can be done as a tour, right?)Hoi An 5 daysHue 2 daysHanoi  2 days + Halong bay 2/3 days + Nin bing 1 day tripSapa 2/3 days and back to Hanoi to Fly back I still have to give a better look at transportations, though.Do you think it is feasible? Sure, though I don’t think you really have to plan it ahead that much. I was there during Tet a few years ago and I tended to book things a couple of days ahead of time and just winged it. You might find you want longer in some places and shorter in others. If you’d prefer to look ahead of time, though, this looks good! I’m unsure about the Mekong Delta tour to be honest but most hostels can help you book those. Hello, I am now following this blog and I love it. I have a few more detailed questions. You mentioned holding on to your purse or not taking money out and putting it away where people can see it. What is the best way to keep a copy of your passport and your money safe while walking the streets, paying for food, and while sleeping?  If you do get attacked or robbed and they are pulling on you and won’t stop, can you fight back or are you going to go to jail if you hit them (not recommended, but sometimes you have to:)  Also, were you concerned about getting bed-bugs and how do all of these places keep the mattresses that are sooo used from getting crabs, lice, and bed bugs?  How do you secure your belongings when you are sleeping in a dorm?Thank you, I truly enjoy all of your posts.Tammy Glad you like the blog! To answer your questions:– Lock everything up back at the guesthouse/hotel/hostel– They’re driving by on a motorbike so there’s very little opportunity to fight back.– I do check for bedbugs. Check the corners of the bed for little spots. I’ve found them twice and decided not to stay.– Many dorms do have lockers (bring your own lock) and I also use a wire mesh bag protector which has been essential in places where there aren’t lockers. More here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/packing-for-southeast-asia/ Beside the comprehensive information, I must say that you’re a fantastic photographer lol Hi, Kristin.  Love the blog!   We are planning a month long trip to Vietnam and Thailand, with emphasis on Vietnam.  We thought that was tons of time, but once you put pen to paper figuring our where to go — not so much!  To avoid a total whistle-stop tour, among other decisions we think we may need to choose between Halong Bay and Phong Nha.  You seem quite bullish on Phong Nha, but of course everyone says one MUST do the Halong Bay cruise.   Would it be madness to skip Halong Bay?   Or, we could squeeze in an overnighter in each of those places, although that strikes us as a bit rushed.  What do you think?  Any thoughts would be hugely appreciated! Since they’re in completely different parts of the country, I’m wondering why it’s an either/or for those two since you have a month. I personally wasn’t impressed by Halong Bay I’m sad to say, but the weather wasn’t great and I admit it is beautiful, but very touristy. I’d cut out time in the more touristy beach spots. They’re not that special, but Phong Nha, to me, was the best part of Vietnam. Great post! I have to say that Vietnam is so wonderful. I started my trip there from Ho Chi Minh city then took the flight to Hanoi Capital. The food was so stunning. A bit surprised by the crazy traffic in peak hours :)). After Hanoi, I headed to Lan Ha Bay (near Halong Bay) as my friend’s recommendation and got amazing experiences. The boat I stayed (La Pinta cruise) was so excellent with services and activities. I’m considering the Central ( Hoi An and Nha Trang) for my upcoming trip in Vietnam. I love the central part. Agreed on the traffic. It’s nuts! Hi there!I am looking into spending a month in Vietnam but I’m having trouble finding information about trekking there. Is it possible to do multiple day hikes independently and camp without booking tours? Would hitting national parks throughout the country be a good way to experience the nature of Vietnam?Thank you! I didn’t actually do much hiking there, which is rare for me to be honest, but I’m sorry I don’t really know the answer to this one. Hi Kristin! Can I ask how long this trip took for you? About a month. I took my time but if you can give it a month then do! Do you transfer accommodation in every city you go? Or do you just stay in one accommodation only? You’d have to stay in new places in each town, yes. Me and my family is planning to travel in Vietnam or 7 days. Please recommend us where to stay when we arrive from airport. Thank you!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-books-for-traveling-in-asia/,The Best Books to Read For Traveling in Asia,Vietnam,"Reading is where I get the majority of my enjoyment these days. Whether it be a book or an online publication, reading has been such a great way to learn more about each culture I’m in, to figure out how to develop income streams, and even how to better understand interpersonal relationships. This particular list is a set of my favorites for traveling in Asia. Each of them sheds some light on the cultures and many are autobiographical. One thing they all have in common is they are each incredibly compelling reads. This is an ever growing and evolving list as I find more great reads to add, but for the time being, here are the books that I’ve read from cover to cover over the past two years and would absolutely recommend that you do the same:    First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers by Loung Ung This is easily one of the most powerful books I have ever read and is one of the best insights into Cambodia’s troubled past. It helped me appreciate even more the vibrant, smiling people Cambodians are today.  It details the loss, hardship, and ugly realities of the Pol Pot regime from 1975 onward in Cambodia in such a way that brought tears to my eyes more than once while reading. It wasn’t easy to get through and there were times when my hair was standing straight up on my arms, immersing myself in the story of this remarkable woman’s childhood. More than that, her strength and courage shines through as the reader watches her turn from a spoiled city child to a strong, independent fighter. For those traveling in Cambodia, understanding the genocide is important to understanding how the country has become what it is today.  Miss Bangkok: Memoirs of a Thai Prostitute by Bua Boonmee First of all, I don’t meant to say that this book is everything you need to know about Thailand or its vibrant culture, but there is no denying that a great many people come to Thailand as sex tourists. This book really helped highlight how some women come to end up in the sex business, and it is incredibly eye-opening. I won’t give away any more than that, but suffice to say, it’s a powerful story and one that shed some light on the reasons behind why some of these women do what they do in order to survive. I’m willing to bet many of the patrons of the Thai sex industry have no idea about the harsh realities behind the curtain.  Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam by Andrew X. Pham This book was a compelling page-turner written by an author who truly has a gift for writing. I felt like reading his words helped me grow as a writer, as a traveler in Vietnam, and even as an American. Andrew X. Pham was born in war-torn Vietnam and he and his family risked their lives to come to the United States as refugees when he was a child. He grew up as a quasi-outsider in the US and as an adult, only to feel the same feeling as an outsider in his birth country. His objective was to cycle through the country, and while this would have been a compelling enough story, it’s really the cultural reflections and Andrew’s feelings and difficulties that made it so interesting for me. I personally really loved visiting Vietnam. As a white American, it’s amazing how different our experiences ended up being. If you read this before or even during a tip to Vietnam, you’ll be moved.  Little Princes: One Man’s Promise to Bring Home the Lost Children of Nepal by Conor Grennan Little Princes is the first book I read during my travels in Southeast Asia. It left a lasting impact as I made my own way to Nepal less than a year and a half later. Grennan’s self-deprecating writing style in the beginning endeared me to him as a reader, and made it easy to empathize with him throughout the book as he made astonishing discovery after astonishing discovery about orphanages in Nepal. Whether you plan to visit Nepal or not, this is a fantastic read and one that I have recommended over and over to friends and family. Sold by Patricia McCormick Sold is a novel based on the true stories of thousands of girls smuggled from Nepal to India to become sex slaves. While this is certainly not a feel good book with puppies and rainbows jumping out of every page, I sometimes think reads like this are important to understanding the world  in every aspect – the good and the bad. Through awareness and education, there can be growth and change. (Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, parts of China, the list goes on)  What Makes You Not a Buddhist by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse The title of this book really is misleading.  It seems like it’s going to be a long, dry, boring account of the religion when in reality, it’s a genius, engaging, and easy-to-understand explanation of Buddhism as a philosophy towards life, love, and loss. Though I’m not a religious person, this book truly did change my life and outlook for the better. It helped me understand change, what is really important in life, helped me grasp compassion, and to let go of anger. I know that’s a lot for one book to do, but it opened a world to me that I otherwise couldn’t quite understand given my Western background and upbringing. The author does a great job of explaining Buddhism in a Western framework without pushing Buddhism as a religion, making it appropriate for people of any religious or cultural background. It was a super helpful intro for me before going into a 10-day silent meditation in Thailand. In short, it just seeks to help spread understanding. This is the book I recommend the most to friends of mine who are traveling, going through a transformative time, or simply looking for a better understanding of life in general. Best of all, all the proceeds are donated.  I wrote this guidebook after three years of traveling by myself, two of which I spent in Asia. I’ve gone back after 5 years of consecutive solo travel and updated it with new information as well, including how to get over the fear of traveling alone, how to save up, how to stay safe on the road, how to save up, earn, and save money on the road, and have included a bunch of case studies and advice from other solo female travelers as well. This is the most comprehensive resource out there for women traveling alone! A Thousand New Beginnings: Tales of Solo Female Travel in Southeast Asia is a memoir I wrote during the first year that I traveled alone in Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. It’s the personal account of deciding to leave my job and boyfriend to travel solo with a one-way ticket and nothing but a carry-on backpack. It includes excerpts from this blog, along with a lot of entries from my diary that I never posted, including falling in love, nursing heartbreak, and finding surprises on the road at every turn. — I read all of my books on a Kindle because my goal of traveling light would be quite hampered by large books. Given I’m usually reading 2-3 at a time, I need them in electronic format. Plus, I can keep highlights and clippings of the books for later reference – which I do make use of. I am always looking to add to this list, so if you know of a great read, let me know! Lastly, these are affiliate links, which means if you make a purchase via the link, I get a very small percentage of the sale price. It’s not much but it does help me maintain this website. Now that I think about it, if you have someone special in your life that is traveling soon, one of the best gifts would be these books loaded on a Kindle. Just a thought! Happy travels.   I love this because I always try to read a book about the place I’m traveling to/in. I also appreciate that you highlighted books written by people who actually live or are from those countries. I think both  perspectives (insider vs outsider) are good, but I always tend to lean to the home country authors. Last, I read Catfish and Mandala about 10 years ago and I still remember how good it was! Which is at lot considering I often can’t remember books I read last year:) I like the first-hand narrative style of people from the countries as well. Sometimes it’s an outsider who wrote it as in the cases with the Nepal books, but the others gave me a better insight, I felt. Hi,I was going through the comments, and saw your reply asking for the affiliate link of the book Nothing to Envy. I will take this opportunity to send the link to youHere’s the link:Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea I loved your website and articles. You are doing a great job! Thanks and thanks! “The Red Market” by Scott Carney.By no means is this an uplifting book either but it does show you a dark world hidden within some countries like India, Philippines, & China.http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061936463 It’s important to understand all aspects, I think. Not just the good parts. Thanks for the recommendation! Ah, amazing! I was just thinking one of my aims for my trip next year should be to read at least one book about each country I visit. This is a great selection to get me started. Wish I had some recommendations for you, I plan to have many by the end of my trip! Great then I look forward to your eventual recommendations! I know a must-read for Myanmar- From the Land of Green Ghosts http://www.amazon.com/From-Land-Green-Ghosts-Burmese/dp/0060505230 Awesome, thank you! Thank you, Kristin for your great list of book. Next week I will go to Myanmar and I was glad find book about this country in comment to this post. Now I read “From the Land of Green Ghosts” and expect very interesting travel. I just love the commenters on this blog! They’re so helpful. Anything on China? I’m heading there in a few days. I’ve been reading China in Ten Words by Yu Hua, which has been a fairly easy read and talks about the author’s upbringing during the Cultural Revolution, among other things. I’m definitely going to check out What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Thanks! I’ve read a lot of textbooks about China, especially modern Chinese politics (it was an area of study for me at University) but not as many memoirs. A good friend of mine loves My Several Worlds by Pearl S. Buck. There’s a novel called To Live by Yu Hua that you might find very interesting. It’s about a formerly rich family’s struggle as Mao rises to power. There actually are a lot of memoirs about China, too many of them. The most popular ones are Peter Hessler’s books, works by Xinran, Wild Swans, Wild Grass, and Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress. I personally recommend Ancestral Leaves by Joseph W. Esherick, which chronicles his wife’s family through most of Modern Chinese history. As a historian, he knows his facts. Many of them focus on the turbulence of the Mao Era or the strains on society caused by the neck-breaking  pace of development. Pearl S. Buck, writes from the Republican era. Mo Yan, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a good place to start for contemporary Chinese literature. He works tend to be a bit political and focus on Chinese society. Soul Mountain, also by a Chinese Nobel laureate for literature, Gao Xingjian, is in contrast a much more personal journey and doesn’t touch much on the social upheavals of the era. The Republican era was a golden era for Chinese arts and literature. Writers from that era, such as Lu Xun, Xiao Hong, Ba jin, Qian Zhongshu, and Lao Shu, are still deeply revered in modern Chinese society. Thanks so much for the suggestions, Paul! It’s clear to me now that I should have been reading a lot more books on China all along. It’s the country that fascinates me the most. Will definitely add some of these to my list of books to read and hopefully grow this post to include some of these. Oh, totally love this post. I’m always looking for books or movies that have the places I want to see in them. Great idea. 🙂 I absolutely adore The Lover for Vietnam. It’s an oldie but a goodie. Adapted from a book as well which I suppose I should have included here as I’ve read that one too but forgot about it until now! I’ve just started ‘Anil’s Ghost’ by Michael Ondaatje which touches on Sri Lanka during their civil war. So far I really love it – perhaps I am slightly biases since I was there in September and have a huge love for the country, but I would say it’s worth reading! I do as well since I was there about a year ago. Thanks for letting me know because I’d love to learn more about that beautiful island. Great list Kristen! I haven’t read Miss Bangkok, Sold, or What Makes You Not  Buddhist, but the others are great and really do have a lasting imrpession, especially when you read them in the country they’re set in. 🙂Reading books about different countries and their history, and other travellers’ account of their adventures is one of my favourite parts of travel!! You’ve read all the others? Nice! I guess great minds think alike. Out of those I’d recommend What Makes You Not Buddhist next, but that is my favorite book so I’m biased 🙂 For fiction, the Bangkok 8 series is interesting and entertaining. Certainly not an accurate representation of Thailand in general, but the author does highlight several finer points of Thai Buddhist practices and cultures that are fascinating and interesting to read about if you’ve spent some time there. I really enjoy books about Buddhism so I might like that one a lot. Ahhh thank you for the reminder that I have been meaning to read “First They Killed My Father” for three years now since first visiting Cambodia! Added it to the list. Great, great read. I just read a great book set in India, by Kiran Desai, called Hullabaloo In The Guava Orchard. A really easy, funny read, with engaging characters and great descriptive prose. Of course for fiction, there’s always Memoirs Of A Geisha, too, which I LOVE. One I really recommend is called Nothing To Envy, by Barbara Demick. There are accounts of six defectors who escaped North Korea during the massive famine that killed millions in the 90’s. Such a good book about a country that we don’t know that much about. I loved Memoirs of a Geisha as well! I read it in high school.  THANK YOU for the Nothing to Envy suggestion. I think I’ll read that next because N. Korea really fascinates me. If you have an affiliate link with amazon send it over 🙂 What a great list of books. Thanks! I think I’d start with the What Makes You Not a Buddhist. Its a great one to start with One of my absolute favorite books has always been Shantaram. I recommend it to everyone! Its a beautiful autobiography (some ppl do challenge this) of a convict from Australia who escaped prison and ran off to India. He really writes beautifully about living in the country and his adventures there.  And then of course if you want a lighter take on India, there’s always Holy Cow that helps balance off the two experiences =) I did read Shantaram and while I felt the guy was a good writer I just couldn’t get past his god complex. It bothered me. It did help me get a better feel for India (I guess?) but I didn’t love it enough for it to make the list. It was a compelling read, though. I give it a 6 out of 10. There are some great books here! Some of my favourites are A Fine Balance (India), Wild Swans (China), The Quiet American (Vietnam), Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (Japan) and Ghostwritten (set in many locations, but the Mongolia story is my favourite). Maybe I should write my own post! Thanks for the recommendations! Looks like I need to do some China reading. Thanks for this list! I’m living in bangkok at the moment and really wanted some reading inspiration! What makes you not a Buddhist is honestly one of the most amazing books I’ve read, I’m going to spread the word it’s very rare to find something so grounded in fact and truth yet so magical at the same time. Keep doing what you’re doing – I love your blog! Xx Yay! I’m glad you liked the book! It really did change my life for the better. Oh, this brings back memories. I always used to try to read a book set in another country before I got there/while I was travelling around. I’m not quite sure when I got out of the habit. I’d like to do it again, though. Thanks for the inspiration! Always such a nice way to understand and appreciate a country’s history 🙂 I love to read about places that I’ve been too. I read a LOT of China books because it helps me grasp the country a bit more. You should check out Peter Hessler’s books – he’s an awesome writer. I’m really curious about the Buddhism book, it would be nice to learn a bit more. Awesome thank you. I think you’re the second to comment recommending Holy Cow so I’ll look that one up. The other sounds incredible as well. Thanks for the great list, I am excited to check these out. I always try to read books when traveling in a country – I feel like it gives so much great context and cultural understanding that you don’t always get just by interacting with locals. Here are a few that I found useful – for Cambodia – Report from the Stricken Land; for China – easily the best travel companion is China Road by Rob Gifford (also available as an excellent audio book); and for India – Inspite of the Gods – the rise of Modern India. All of these were written by journalists who covered these countries for decades and have plenty of anecdotes, historical knowledge and well rounded understanding of a range of subjects pertinent to these countries. Those are great suggestions! A lot on this list are written by locals but it would be great to get a journalist’s perspective as well. Thank you for the incredible list its helpful.. Great suggestions! I loved Catfish and Mandala! Although its not as deep and insightful… No touch monkey was a great lighthearted traveler’s book for southeast asia (and other parts of the world)… definitely recommend for a light read 🙂 Thanks for the suggestion. I definitely agree with the title at least! Thanks for the recommendation for: What Makes You Not a BuddhistGreat description and awesome read. Just finished the book this avo! Awesome I’m so glad you liked it! I was excited to see that a lot of people ordered that one. I think it would make the world a better place if everyone read it 🙂 I read “When Broken Glass Floats” while in Phnom Penh which is a similar memoir to First They Killed My Father. I had planned to read them both, but after the first one, I didn’t think I could handle reading about that tragic history again. The book reduced me to tears more than a few times, and like you say, made me appreciate the smiles and hospitality around the country so much more. The other books you’ve listed look great as well, Miss Bangkok looks powerful, and Bkk is one of my favourite cities ever – might have to read that one on my next plane ride there. Thanks! I cried too reading First They Killed My Father. I agree it might be tough to read two such memoirs back to back. I started reading one about a child soldier in Sierra Leone and wondered to myself why I read such tough books but then realized, it helps you appreciate the current situation much more and the need for love in this world more than ever. Hi Kristin, Did you use a travel guide in south east Asia? Awesome website by the way, inspiring and useful! X iris Nope. I never do. I get my ideas by talking to locals. Orwell’s first novel, Burmese Days, paints Colonial Burma in a satirical light and offers decent insight into old traditions such as chewing betel. It’s worth reading just to see Orwell’s nearly century old take on present day Myanmar as well as his stunning insights into the bureaucratic nonsense that came along with it. Thank you for the recommendation! Hi there, I really enjoyed reading your past updates and most recent post 🙂 I was recommended your blog by transient20s. I have just started on WordPress since I am just beginning my travels – not only to keep my own recording of the journey, but also to read other people’s recommendations and insights. Some of the stuff I have read so far is great and I would love if you had any other recommended bloggers etc for me to follow? I am 23 and my first post lists the places I will be visiting. Thank you! Rebecca x How kind of them to recommend me. Yes for sure! These are my faves: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-travel-blogs/ I’ve always considered “The Beach” a must read for anyone visiting Asia, but I love your list. Will definitely try to read at least one of those books this year! I haven’t actually read it but based on the movie, can definitely see why. I was trying to think of things that are less based on fiction and more based on the culture of the countries, but should read that one as well. If you are travelling India I absolutely recommend “The God of Small Things” for some beautiful magic realism and accurate “images” of local kids. And of course I have to recommend the famous “the white tiger” also full of indian typical images and very very entertaining reading. Both Indian writers Would love to read them regardless! I love having a peek into a culture I’m not yet familiar with Yep, Catfish and Mandala is a good one. I read it long before I ever wen to SE Asia, but remember it as a compelling read. So compelling and well-written. I love reading people who are such great writers as they encourage me to improve. I loved Little Princes! I recently did a Buddhist temple stay here in Korea and loved my time there. I’ll definitely have to check out “What makes you not a Buddhist” as I really want to learn more about the religion.Thanks for the recommendation!Some of my favourites are Escape from camp 14, a book about one of the few people to have escaped from North Korea’s prisoner camps. A shocking but interesting read (although it came out recently that he had lied about a few things in the book)Into Thin Air is also a great read! I am so fascinated by North Korea so I’m definitely going to give that a read. Thank you for the suggestion! Are there book about Malaysia and How long can I use these book? I haven’t read one about Malaysia yet but when I do I’m happy to post about it! These are mostly memoirs and relevant any time. Thanks for the awesome list! I am definitely going to check them out, especially the one about Buddhism. When I’m in Thailand later this year I am going to check out a meditation retreat in a temple, so I should probably learn more about Buddhism first. 😛 That’s a really good idea and I was very glad I’d read that book prior to going simply to have the basics down when the monks referenced the Truths.  Is it this one you’re going to? Was a very profound experience for me: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/monastery-thailand/I have some tips to help you prep here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/suan-mokkh/    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chillest-places-asia/,The 8 Chillest Places in Asia,Vietnam,"When you imagine the most peaceful place you’ve ever been, what comes to mind? I’ve been to places where, whether it’s because of a hippie vibe, a genuine feeling of peace, or just the amazing people around me (usually all three), it just feels chill, and I feel like I could stay there forever. I came to realize over time that these are the places I like the most. They’re usually small communities, very focused on the preservation and appreciation of nature, and the general feeling is one of calm. Here are the best of what I’ve discovered so far: Even the name, Ella, sounds all magical and beautiful. In Ella, plenty of bars and restaurants have lounge lofts with bean bags, coffee stops, and your typical corner roti man serving up meals for under a dollar. The train ride to or from this beautiful town is breathtaking as well (get the spot in the doorway!). Ella itself is full of waterfalls, wonderful hiking, and is bordered by tea plantations on both sides. I’ve said it before and will say it again: it’s some sort of unspoken rule that anywhere with tea plantations will and must be beautiful. Yubeng is located in the far west of China, right up against Tibet in Yunnan province. It’s high in the mountains and from the nearest city – Deqen – can only be reached via 15km by foot or mule. In Yubeng the chickens, donkeys, and pigs run around anywhere they want, the locals dress brightly, and the air is crisp and clean. It’s a sacred area and all along the trail to Yubeng prayer flags are strung along the trees. I’ve never been anywhere as peaceful in my life. The white snow, the tall peaks, the running water, the steaming chicken hot pot, the ever-present silence and reflection, and the lovely people still give me a feeling of grace and peace when I think of it. I talk about Pai all the time. In life, in this blog, in my dreams. I just love it there and it feels like such a hippie paradise. I could get stuck listening to reggae, eating amazing inventive eggs benedict at Boomelicious and play with fire at the Circus School all day. I could visit the Land Split, swim in the waterfalls, and drink iced coffees all day as well, and usually do some combination of all of the aforementioned in the span of just one afternoon. The thought has often crossed my mind to take up a longer term residence there at some point. Speaking of hippie paradises, Otres Beach in Cambodia might be the winner, at least when I was there a little over two years ago. Most visitors who spend a while there have the same routine: wake up, swim, have some muesli and green tea, buy a mixed bag of small and sweet banana, mango and pineapple from the fruit lady, have a few Anchor beers, swim, consider BBQ or a bonfire, rinse, repeat. Why not? It’s paradise incarnate with its white sand beaches and perfect clear blue water. Don Det is the first place I’ve ever seen a double rainbow. I was floating down the Mekong river in an inner tube and right before me, stretching from one bank to the other, was the most perfect double rainbow at the most perfect time that it could have appeared. It’s easy to laze away in Don Det, reading, swaying in a hammock, riding a bike around, and just existing in that river world. I didn’t expect to see hippies in China, and then I arrived in Dali. Dali has everything from the old man still living in a traditional house, wearing traditional clothing, growing a full fu manchu and a smoking long-stem pipe, to the dreadlocked rasta Chinese guy in his early 30s selling handmade bracelets on the steps of the main street. Dali is relaxed, it sits on a beautiful lake, and Chinese and Western tourists both absolutely love it. Tonsai beach, located off of Krabi and not to be confused with the Tonsai on Koh Phi Phi, is gorgeous. Discovered by accident when I was entranced by the look of Tonsai on my way to Railay (I asked the boat man to take me back to Tonsai once I’d seen it, please and thank you), I’ve returned and just love the chill vibe and beautiful surroundings. Tonsai is also an active place, full of kayakers, divers, rock climbers, fire dancers ,and slack-line walkers. It’s the perfect place to pick up a new skill, or to just laze around by the beach and read books. This was my favorite part of Vietnam because the locals flashed peace signs at me as I rode by on my motorbike, families watched fascinated and waved from their porches, and and old lady sat on my bike with me, stroked my face, and then rested for a while as we just sat there in relaxed silence. It was all quite strange and amazing. There’s really only one road through the town and not a whole lot of noise or business around. This makes for a really peaceful, agricultural, and naturally beautiful place. I definitely felt calm and in my natural element while at Phong Nha. — Those are my personal favorites, but there are an infinite number of chill places to find, no doubt, and what is chill is usually a bit undiscovered, so the chillness level does change often. Regardless, when I look back on my travels, these are the places I tended to enjoy the most and to find the most like-minded people. Coincidentally they are all naturally beautiful. What would you add to the list? I’m always on the hunt for the next peaceful, quiet, mellow destination.   Hi Kristin,First thanks for the list: after 7 years, I will be back in Southeast Asia in a few days for 4 months, and 2 of the places you list are actually on my list (never been there before): Phong Nha Ke Bang & Otres Beach. I was actually scared Otres Beach would be awfully touristy!In a completely different way, the last place I found really relaxing and inviting to slow down in Asia was Turtuk, in the Nubra Valley in Ladakh.CheersGilles It’s possible it has become more touristy since I was last there – in fact I’m sure it is. If you really want something more remote you can head to Rabbit island off of Kep in Cambodia. They didn’t actually have running water or even electricity when I was last there, so I’m guessing things may have upgraded slightly since then. Would love to hear your thoughts after you go to Otres! Thanks Kristin!I will let you know and of course write about it.I am concerned about the masses especially since I will be there over Xmas.CheersGilles Please add the name of each country. The name of each country is listed right next to the name of the city. Ella is in Sri Lanka, Pai is in Thailand, etc. Hoi An is very pretty. I’ve heard great things about Khao Sok! Otres Beach was definitely a highlight of my Asia trip. I met some awesome people there and we enjoyed low key days on the beautiful beach and then BBQ and (50 cent) beers after the sun set. Perfect. I also really liked Don Det and Pai so it seems like we have similar tastes. I’ll have to check out the rest the next time I’m in Asia. I think the beach BBQ I had on Otres was the best I’ve ever had. The meat was so good and we ate it all with our hands. I just love eating with my hands, to be perfectly honest. I would also add Chitwan in Nepal and also Battambang in Cambodia. Unbelievable laid back and peaceful for a small city! Thanks! I should check those out as I haven’t been to either one. “It just feels chill” – Ok, you couldn’t have said it better. Great suggestions and i love the photos (hanging out in Pai is my favourite). Haha, it’s a feeling, you know? Awesome! If you hit any of these I think you’ll be pleased with the vibes. These place are all really nice, but if you reaaaally want to chill out I’d say head to Central Asia! Like Khorog in Tajikistan, or Arslanbob in Kyrgyzstan. So laid back! So many people have suggested that lately and I’ve heard great things. They’re on the list now. Aahhh I am ALL about the chill places! Def adding these to my list for my RTW next year. Thank you! 🙂 Nothing better than a great chill place! It’s now my mission to visit as many of these places as I can on my trip to Asia next year. Thanks for sharing them! That’s awesome! Let me know how it goes please! Dali is the only place I really want to visit in China…met a couple who owns a hotel there and it just sounds magical There are so many other amazing places in China worth visiting as well, especially around Dali. Let me know if you ever make it out there! Khao Sok in Thailand was incredible.. I had to return a few months later! I will go back as well. I agree with Don det, so relaxed. Great post, gives me some ideas for the future Thanks for letting me know about Khao Sok. I want to check it out! Hi you should try Easter island its Amazing i sat at the higest point on the island, then it hit me there is No one higher than me for 3500km wow .. That’s very cool! Her Kristin,This is a real cool post. I liked it so much I reposted on my blogs facebook page 🙂 I thought I would have been to more but have only been to 3 places on this list! I think Tonsai Beach was my favourite chillest place thus far! A couple of cool chill places in India would be McLeod Ganj (gorgeous tibetan town in the foot of the Himalayas), Palolem Beach in Goa ($3 private beachfront cananas – yes please!) and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan (go and stay in a castle for a few days eating amazing foods while watching the sun set from the roof of the castle). Have you been to any of these? Awesome, thank you! Thanks so much for giving me India tips! I am really looking forward to the time when I take off for an extended trip through there. Yes, Ella does sound very pretty and serene… And Pai? We’ve not heard of that before in Thailand. Another chill spot is Gili Air (one of the Gili islands off Lombok, Indonesia) – but don’t go to neighboring Gili T if you’re looking for “chill” as that’s quite a party island! We loved Koh Lanta in Thailand – found it very restful. But we hear a bridge is being built to connect it to Krabi, so rumour has it that the island may not stay so peaceful for long… I went to Gili T for a week right at the end of my first 10 months in SEA and have to say I really enjoyed it! I know it’s a party place but better for a solo traveler. I think Gili Air would have been awesome with a partner but my friend came back and said solo it was a little depressing.  You haven’t heard of Pai?! I’m obsessed with Pai! Go forth and visit! Thanks Kristin for exploring some best places of Asia through this post. Thanks for reading 🙂 Great post! I would love to check out Don Det, Laos. It seems like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. You’re website is pretty amazing. Hope my blog can be half as good as yours one day. That’s really kind of you, David! I would say you could be right assuming Don Det is like a quieter version of Vang Vieng. It’s still its own thing and its own place but both are worth checking out. Both are beautiful. Hi Kristin,I am headed to Southeast Asia in a few months but will only be able to stay for a little over a month. I am starting in Thailand and ending in Bali with a final night in Singapore. I am hoping to be efficient and get to see parts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia as well. Any suggestions on how to make the most of your time while backpacking and ensure you get to see everything on your list? (Not your list specifically, just a list in general :-)) Any advice would be awesome!Thanks,Jordan You’re a bit limited with that timeframe and I’m sure you don’t want to burn yourself out with rapid movement, so I’d suggest seeing Angkor Wat in Cambodia, checking out an island such as Perhentian or Tioman in Malaysia, and exploring Hanoi and the surrounding areas in Vietnam, as those were the highlights for me and I bet you’d be pretty happy with those spots. So glad to hear it’s still good because I would like to return in May 🙂 Gah! I miss Pai so much and it was by far my favorite place in Thailand to visit. The hammocks, the sunsets, the night market, and the freakin’ food! I never made it to Tonsai but I’ll have to hit that next time I’m in Thailand. I feel like we are very alike in places we love to chill, so when I do finally get to Sri Lanka and China and the like, I’ll make it a point to check these out! we probably do have similar taste! Pai is always a wonderful place to be. I love your posts! And since I read the articles about Pai I just want to go there like immediately 🙂 in 2 weeks it is gonna be so far 🙂 Could you please share, where I can find this chill terrace from your Pai picture?  Wish you lots of fun on your further trips!! Thanks Maria! The photo is at the Container. OTRES BEACH brings back some serious ‘chill’ memories. Its amazing how its right down then way from the ‘main’ beach but its literally deserted.   Great choice! Glad to hear it’s still like that because I plan to return after 2.5 years away in May! Hi Kristin!I really enjoy your post, I ran into your blog for I will embark on my first solo trip in a couple months. I’ll be heading to Pai and I just love the picture you posted for Pai. Do you mind telling me the place. The one with the beautiful scenery and hanging chairs. Thanks It’s called the Container 🙂 HelloWhere in Pai is the photo with the swinging chairs taken? I’d love to go!K It’s called the Container, near Coffee in Love Hi, I will be travelling to southeast Asia in a couple weeks. Where are the hanging egg shaped seats in Pai? Thanks The Container Hello, is a great article. I hope sometimes i will visit Asia because is such a great place and i like their food Always wanted to visit Asia. And your post makes me want to make it happen more. Thank you! c”,) Indeed, Pai and the Land Split, are quite the Chill places! The snacks and beverages on those hammocks had me feeling like I was just floating on a cloud. I can still taste that yummy tamarind…mmmMMM. Hi Kristin! I’ll be back to Asia next year, and this is absolutely gold to include in my plans, thank you! I know you focus mainly in Southeast Asia, but if you ever decide to change destination, you could try Costa Rica 🙂 Puerto Viejo and Montezuma, even if are touristic places, have that chill vibe that make you question if you should leave everything to just live there! Thanks for the great post! I went through Costa Rica once for a week when I was in my early 20s and hit Belize the year after that for the same length of time. I’d love to move slowly through Central America the way I did through Southeast Asia. I’ve heard it’s a great place for slow travel as well Great post and I agree with otres being the best! I lived there for a while but do make sure you choose otres 2 not 1. kampot (a couple of hours) away is also amazing! Found some new gems from this for the next travels though. Great article. Thanks 🙂 There are 2 now? I figured it had started to grow…    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/best-hostels-in-vietnam/,My Favorite Hostels in Vietnam,Vietnam,"I started counting and realized that in the past 18 months of traveling as a nomad, mostly in Southeast Asia, a full month of which was spent in Vietnam, I’ve slept in no fewer than 157 beds, tents, hostels, guest houses, apartments, homes, home-stays, and even concrete beds. That’s a lot of places to lay one’s head!  Vietnam is the country I actually left for last when traveling in Southeast Asia, and now I wonder why! I loved it so much, in part because of the great hostel options. I base my ratings and reviews of hostels on three main things: cleanliness, social atmosphere, and staff.  At most of the following hostels, I ended up meeting really amazing people, had a good experience with the staff, and found the rooms to be clean (enough). Please keep in mind that I’m a budget-oriented traveler, who likes a good value for my money, meaning I won’t go for the cheapest, dirtiest option just to save a few bucks, but I won’t spring for a luxurious suite either. The booking links are in the title of each hostel: Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) Town House 50 I didn’t know before I arrived in Saigon that I was staying ever so slightly outside of the Pham Ngu Lao “backpacker area,” which ended up being just about the best choice ever.  The backpacker area is pretty seedy, and reminded me quite a bit of Khao San road in Bangkok – pick-pocketing is rampant in the area and it’s just not appealing.  The great part is it was only a ten minute walk away, so when I felt like having cheap beer, I could walk right over to Pham Ngu Lao, and then return to the safety of Town House 50 when I was finished. Town house 50 is clean, the staff is absolutely incredible, and a the cooked-to-order daily included breakfast made this one of my favorite hostels to date. Nha Trang Mojzo Inn Don’t ask me to pronounce this place, because I surely can’t! Though I’m not the biggest fan of Nha Trang – I find it’s way too touristy and is really only good for partying – I have honestly never encountered a friendlier staff than the girls who work at Mojzo. They try to remember everyone’s name at this rather big hostel, are incredibly helpful, and so cheerful that it’s infectious. The cooked-to-order rooftop breakfast, included in the room rate, would make this my favorite hostel in Southeast Asia if only it wasn’t in Nha Trang! Hoi An Sunflower Hotel Sunflower Hotel has a pool, the price is right, and it seems to be the hangout for budget-conscious backpackers in Hoi An. You’re sure to meet plenty of people there, and they have a free pick-up service from the bus stop! Conveniently, they have bike rentals on site for only $1/day. The breakfast buffet is a pretty impressive spread as well. It’s a great value for the money. Hanoi Little Hanoi Diamond Hotel Much superior to the Hanoi Backpacker’s option, where they are pretty darn disorganized, this smaller hotel is about the same price, when sharing the room with another person, and is much nicer. The downstairs area is a nice place to have friends over and socialize before going out, and it’s still close enough to the bars and backpacker area to walk over for nighttime festivities. — I’ve saved this for my trip – thanks! 🙂 Totally agree with these recommendations, especially Little Hanoi 🙂 Ah and boy do I miss those breakfast buffets in Vietnam! Never knew that about Agoda. Thanks! There are definitely a lot of options available. Probably too much! I struggled a bit in Hanoi. Most places seem to be geared towards couples, families or boozy backpackers. For me I just want a shower that doesn’t sit above the toilet seat! Yeah, it wasn’t as easy in Hanoi. Having someone to share with there is definitely nice. Hi Kristin,thanks for that input, I will surely look at it again when I arrive in Vietnam, especially since I am looking for the same type of accommodation as you, it seemsCheersGilles I agree with everything about Mozjo!! Such a great hostel and some of the best staff I’ve ever encountered, but I hated that it had to be in Nha Trang! I’d probably go back just for the hostel lol!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/chinese-visa-in-hanoi/,Vietnam to China: Visas and Land Crossings,Vietnam,"After flying from California to Europe, then to Chiang Mai, to Sri Lanka, to the Maldives, the Philippines, and then Vietnam, I’m tired of flying, and I knew that once I got to the top of Vietnam there was no way I would have interest in flying from there to China given they share a border. Unfortunately, I found minimal information on getting a visa and making the land border crossing. I read all kinds of forums stating that the easiest way is to go through a travel agent.  Numerous comments followed from people who only got 21-day visas because the agency had pocketed the extra money for the 30-day and only returned their passports to them with a 21-day visa.  Yikes! Even if this wasn’t the case, I still wouldn’t go through an agency because, why do that when the embassy is right there? Taking matters into my own hands, I found the embassy in Hanoi and did it all myself.  The whole process took about 5 days and just a few minutes per visit to the embassy.  Here’s how it’s done: Getting a China visa in Hanoi Now that I’ve typed that out, it does seem a bit involved, but I have a chip on my shoulder when it comes to doing things through a tour or travel agency, so I had to see if it could be done on my own. All in all it really wasn’t that bad, and took very little time with each visit to the embassy, though there were multiple visits which an agent would eliminate, though there is a risk of a 21-day visa and higher fees with an agent. Crossing the Land border into China This was relatively straightforward, to begin with, at least. It was pretty easy to head from Sapa to China, even after a day of trekking for about 10km.  I still had an amazing action-packed day and was able to get into China by nightfall. I, personally, wanted to head to Xin Jie Zhen (Yuan Yang) first, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site famous for its amazing rice paddies. No, I didn’t get enough in Sapa.   For those looking to head to Kunming, it’s possible to get overnight or daytime transport from He Kou. There are no overnight busses there, which meant I’d be staying in the border town of He Kou for the night. Luckily, it’s a nice little town – for a border town – and nothing like the seedy ones I’ve seen in Cambodia, for example. However, I ran into an issue when the only blog I could find on the border town subject turned out to be wrong about the ATM placement.  It appeared as though construction had replaced it with a concrete wall.  I ran around to all of the other nearby ATMs I could find – none of which would work for me.  I had no Chinese Yuan, and no money changers were open. My only saving grace was my ability to speak Chinese, as English is simply not spoken in this town.  I was able to explain the situation to a hotel (after the first one waved me away) which thankfully took my passport as collateral and told me I could pay in the morning when the bank opened. The next morning they explained to me where to find it and I was on my way.  Luckily, the ATM there did accept my card and I didn’t have to change any money. So, let me inform you that the ATM you need to find is now near the one and only (small) park in town, which looks like a long roundabout if consulting a map.  If you walk straight out of the embassy, you’ll eventually reach said park.  Look for the Bank of China with a logo that looks a bit like a red target symbol.  Once you hit the park, make a left and you should see it. After obtaining my cash, I caught a little green bus on the street that borders the river (you’ll see green bus stops. Take one headed in the direction away from the border crossing) for 1 RMB and made the 15-minute journey to the main bus terminal where I caught the final 10:30am bus of the day to Xin Jie Zhen.  (Note the busses stop running after dark). There was some conflicting information here, too, as I had also read the final bus departs at 9am.  My guess is things change so rapidly in China that schedules, construction, and various other things make information obsolete after even a year or so. One thing will remain the same: you absolutely can cross the border, take a mini green bus for cheap, and bus out of He Kou to your next destination if heading from Vietnam to China. Share some of your craziest border crossing stories in the comments! Lucky you speak a little of the local language! It’s difficult sometimes trying to figure out the best way to get a visa. You read that you should apply for your visa before you leave home (but that means mailing in your passport). And then you also read that you can get one when you land in the city (maybe…). This was the situation we faced when traveling to several African countries. In the end, we paid top dollars for an expedited visa service to obtain visas for Tanzania (since we’d be arriving in the middle of the night and in Zanzibar, and the airport services could be closed), but took our chances with the other African countries. I’m very lucky I could speak with them! Not sure what would have happened otherwise. Maybe a sleep on the street? Is it possible without flight booking can apply china visa Thanks for writing that up. I wondered about the crossing since I was in Sa Pa also. My friends who are Vietnamese told me that it was not possible to go from Lo Chi to China. When I looked into the China Visa from the US, I thought it was too involved. I like Laos and Cambodia (I did later this one online) because you pay about $25-35 on the spot and get the Visa in about 10 min after you fly in for Loas. I always planned ahead and saved a lot of time. Wicked awesome tips and detail on this Kristen…definitely striving to create guides like this from my experiences. I’ll probably end up having to do something like this when I visit China, and seeing how my luck with border crossings has been a little shaky, this was rad insight =) Glad to help. I forgot to add the Vietnamese exit official stared at my passport for like 15 minutes, calling over others to look at it too. I was like uggghh come on we both know there’s nothing wrong with it. How long was the visa that you got in Vietnam? one month. It’s all you can get at Hanoi Just got our chinese visa in hanoi, was very easy. We printed the off the form online first and filled it out before we went there. We also printed off our insurance policy, our first nights accomodation, (which we later cnacelled). On the forms, we were asked for the names of 5 places we were going to stay. We just got these off hostelworld. When we went in to the embassy, she asked us why we didn’t have all the bookings. I said I didn’t want to book them all until I got the visa. As for flights/transport, we said we were going in by land and flying from Beijing to India, which we said we would book once we got our visa. She said that was ok. We had to call back the next morning to see if we had being approved and we were given the pink slip for paying at the bank. Going to the bank was easy, when you come out of the embassy, turn right and walk for about 500metres until the end of the road. Then turn right and follow the road all the way until you see the Daewoo Hotel, at Daeha Business Center. You can’t miss the big sign. Its about 3km from the embassy. They did not ask for an invitation letter. So overall, it was very easy. What we brought to the embassy wasOur Irish passportsFilled out forms1 passport photosOur insurance policy printed outFirst night booking form hostelworldPhotocopies of our Vietnam visa, our passport and our entry stamp.We got a 30 day visa, single entry. You have 1 month from date of issue to enter the country, and the 30 day visa starts on day of entry. Visa cost 30 USD each for Irish citizens. thanks for all the info, that makes it a lot easier. Can you also tell me if it is possible to aply for a 45day of 60day visa? or is it only possible  to apply for a 30day visa? thanks Only 30 in Hanoi, unfortunately hi Kristin! I lot of friends told me that I can`t apply for chinese tourist visa in Hanoi. Did you apply for chinese tourist visa???? Or which kind of visa did u get??? Hi KristinLoved the info, you made it really simple. Unfortunately once we got to the embassy we were told that we can’t get a tourist visa, they will only give to residents of Vietnam. We then tried an agency and after many phone calls were told we couldn’t get one. This is all due to the recent conflicts between the two countries. Oh well, change of travel plans! Thanks so much for the update. I guess things are getting pretty tense between China and Vietnam at the moment. As an alternative you can first head to Hong Kong to get the visa for the mainland. Getting the visa in hong kong is much much more expensive, though quite hassle free through an agency More expensive?! Wow I thought it was horrible in Vietnam. Thanks for this info, really really useful! Definitely check into what the regulations are at the moment because due to a worsening relationship between China and Vietnam I’d heard this wasn’t possible – at least a few months ago. I am trying to get on next week for a little trip to China, not over bothered if I can’t get it but I will definitely update with the current situation on whether you can go via Hanoi visa system. Thanks I’d definitely like to know what the current situation is! Heading up to Hanoi in a few days and will be applying for the tourist visa ASAP – having heard lots of conflicting reports about what and what not to take, this has been a great help! Just got my fingers crossed now that they’re still giving them out up here! Fingers crossed! Would love it if you let me know how it goes for you. Hey Kristin, Excellent blog and information, really useful, although comments around mid year were a little bleak on the 30 day tourist visa from Hanoi. I’ll be there in about 1 months time and was trying to enter China via the same route as yourself. I’ve sent off various emails to embassies and consulates so I’ll let you know how that goes. Fingers crossed! Thanks again… I know that relations between China and Vietnam got pretty strained after I left due to China’s idea that they owned the sea around there. Hopefully it’s better now and I would love any updates after you try to get the visa. I hope it works out for you! Hi Kristin, have you got any updates on whether they now issue tourist visas in Hanoi or HCMC for foreigners. We are about to book our tickets back home departing from Beijing.Neil and Jack, you were going to try and get a visa in Vietnam, how did it work out?Many Thanks Not sure but I hope someone who tried recently can give us an update! My brother and I got a China *Transit* Visa in Hanoi mid December 2014 with zero problems. – We travelled Hanoi-HK via Nanning and had the whole trip documented (Hostel in Nanning, Bus booking Nanning-HK which was in fact only a temporary reservation, and even flights out of HK)– We arrived just when they opened in the morning. Zero wait time, almost no other people there.– China visa processes seem to be pretty much the same all over the world. So if you do not find infos (about needed documents etc) or even forms from the local embassy just get them from another one (say the one in your home country)– The day you apply already counts as one of the processing days. So if you apply on Monday you can get your visa on Thursday.– The bank really only accepts USD, otherwise you pay a hefty conversion fee.– The security guard was super friendly (not sure if I read otherwise on here or somewhere else .. 🙂– There were other Westerners there inquiring about tourist visas, so I would assume that they do issue them at the moment. Thank you so much for the update! I know a lot of people were wondering so this is great news. I didn’t find the guard unfriendly. He actually let me in after closing hours. Possibly because when he tried to close the door I stuck my shoe in and insisted. He still could have said no, though, and he didn’t. Hi i was wondering if anyone has got a normal travel visa recently from hanoi? i am an irish citizen and have been looking online to see if the two countries relations have improved? Hello all, Just thought I’d give you an update on the China visa from Hanoi (Jan 2015). As confirmed by others already you can now obtain a China visa from the embassy in Hanoi for either 30 days only or a transit visa. There are no others available.  Hope this helps.CheersNeil Ok so the same case as when I went about a year ago. Thanks! Currently in Vietnam and going to China soon.  Thanks for posting and thanks for the updates!  Very helpful 🙂 Glad it’s helpful! Hey, I’m headed to Hanoi on Monday the 6th of April, hoping to get a 30 day tourist visa, anyone have any updates. Thanks for all the posts. I’m glad to hear that! I’m heading to Vietnam tomorrow starting from Ho Chi Minh and I want to enter China by bus from Hanoi.If anyone does get the 30 days tourist visa in Hanoi, could you please confirm how the process is nowadays?I’m mostly concerned about having to buy the return ticket beforehand, as I read that many people didn’t show it and they were granted the visa as well. Thanks for the post and everyone else for the updates!Keep on travelin’! If you must show it, expedia refunds any ticket if you cancel within 24 hours of purchase. Hey gang, I processed my visa in Hanoi 2 weeks ago, First I went on a Monday,  but that was a Chinese holiday, so closed. Returned Tuesday, filled out the form had the passport pics, printout of my first hotel in nanning for 3 nights. I got the call that evening my visa was denied. I needed to give a detailed itinerary of all my stays in China for the entire trip, not just the four destinations.  I was traveling overland from Hanoi to nanning,  then by train to goungzhou,  Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing.   In order to process my 30 day single entry visa I had to book hotels in each location and provide printouts of each,  explaining where I would be and when. I explained to the woman on the phone that it would lock me in, and I wouldn’t be able to extend my stay in any of the locations with prior bookings made for the entire trip. She Didnt care, and then had me print train schedules for the trips between each city. I refused to buy the tickets, and told her so, as they are non-refundable. She was OK with this, but made me show her I knew the schedules by print out. I made my booking for 30 days across 4 locations,  and then canceled the bookings the next day. She Also required my ticket for bus to nanning.  However she did not require a return ticket or flight out of China.  The bonus, I paid 160$ (20$ more) to have it expedited, and returned on Friday to pick it up. I did not get the 30 day single entry I applied for,  I was given a 10 year multiple entry visa good for 60 days per stay.  I’ve been informed this is the new visa for Americans.  So….good thing she’s knows where I’ll be for the next 30 days ha! I think it really comes down to who you deal with when you go, and the mood their in. 🙂  good luck I’m jealous you got the 10-year. I paid $140 twice for 30 days each. Definitely comes down to the mood of the person! Always! I’m a huge fan of your blog and often use it as a resource for my travel plans. But this post was probably the most useful one, and it even popped up as my first result in Google. Thank you!  PS: I know you’re a lot in Berlin, but maybe check out Munich That’s awesome Felix. I hope this information is still relevant but the comments have been helpful on here as well. Enjoy your time in China! I will definitely check out Munich at some point – perhaps for Oktoberfest 😉 Just got my Chinese visa yesterday, 20/8/2015. Was just as simple as described here, all i did was book one nights stay at a hotel in kunming, which i cancelled as soon as I printed it out, and printed out fake tickets for the train from hanoi to lao cai and then from mengzi to kunming. Just did everything up until giving credit card info, printed this out as a confirmation, and they accepted it. Im an American so i got the ten year multiple entry visa, without even asking for it. Anyways, they didn’t ask for insurance, flights out, or anything about my itinerary. It was quite easy really, so don’t stress too much about it! You got a 10 year at the consulate in Hanoi?! They weren’t giving anything over 30 days at the time that I applied. I’m so jealous as I ended up spending $300 on visas just to be there for two months. Applying from home next time! Now you can also take the train from HeKou North Station to Kunming. It’s 6 hours. Thanks for the update! Its now so easy for Americans to get 10 year visas for China for $ 150,you must apply within the United States Yeah I learned that later on. I just hadn’t been in the US for a good 10 months so I didn’t sort it out prior but would definitely do that moving forward. Thank you for your useful information. I am planning a 2 week trip crossing Vietnam to China, your info about visa is very useful for us Hello! I’m a Duch girl and currently in China with a 60 days tourist visa. After sixty days, I’m planning to go to Hong Kong and to Hanoi. After that I want to go back to China. Where should I apply for the new Chinese visum, in HongKong or in Hanoi? Is both possible?Looking forward to hear from you! I’d probably try HK. Should be easier, but I am not an expert with this kind of thing, sorry! Oké, thank you though! Is it possible to obtain te visa in hongkong, than fly to Hanoi and than fly to China and get in to China with the visum obtained in HK? No clue, sorry! Hi – Thanks for the useful information. I am going to be travelling from Hanoi to Mongolia by train via Beijing.  Does anyone have updates regarding if the Chinese Embassy is issuing tourist visas still? Also, if I have confirmed train tickets through China, do I need to book hotels too or would my train tickets be sufficient? Sorry if this seems like an obvious question, but I’ve done my share of travels and know countries can be uniquely bureaucratic.   Thanks in advance for your help! 🙂 Thank you for this.  Very  helpful. I am in Hanoi and have been told 10 different stories, most telling me I cannot get a tourist visa to China at all.  I will head to the embassy.   Much appreciated. If you could let me know how it goes for you, please do! Curious if anything has changed. I just applied for the visa, and i will get it on Monday , 31st Oct 2016. Yout post was so useful so i decided to comment. Now chinese embbasy asked so many document. The first visit, i didnt bring all, so i went there 1 more time with all documents they asked. I applied for double entries, so they may asked me more.– nationality: south korea.Preparation in cluding copies of passport, vietnamese visa page.1. 2 flight tickets. In and out of china2. Travel insurance- i arrange it with less than 5 us in my country’ insurance company3. Hotel booking at least 2 nights4. Schedule in china – make it simple- like date, city, hotel name of all ur visit. ( no need hotel booking, just find hotel in the internet then write down)5. Bank statement: no need official one. Just go to ur internet banking and prink the page ur money value. I heard they request budget 100 us per day. So if u stay there 10 days, you need to show them at least 1000 us in ur account I requested express service, but it takes 4 days working process. I guess many applying so they didnt accept my request.  Once i applied visa, they requested me to come back at 4pm same day. If you come back, you will get you know your apply is accepted or not. If ok, they give a small pink cute paper to pay your visa fee as described the above post. Good luck to everybody for chinese visa. Thank you so much for letting us know all of this! So then they are looking for a bit more than when I went, but I also wasn’t able to apply for a double entry. Good to know and THANKS SO MUCH again! Hi thanks for the useful tips.  We want to enter (and maybe leave) China by train.  A lot of the advice refers to round-trip flights.  Does anyone know if we can get a visa with train tickets instead of flights? Any recent experience or advice much-appreciated! Thanks, Josh Sorry, I should have said we will be applying in Hanoi and are UK citizens!  Thanks, J. Hey!  I already have my visa for china.Now i m in hanoi. And in the next days i will go to china by land.  Can someone tell me if i must show them on the border again the bookings and the fly out Ticket?. Or they want only see my passport and the visa They only requested my visa and passport, personally. Hey there,thanks for all the information!I was wondering: did you book your train ticket out of Vietnam before or after you arranged your visa?Is it better to book the train say for example a week before and then start applying for a visa? Or did you book the train once you had your visa?Hope you will reply, since the blog is already a bit older :).Kind regards I crossed by foot to China. Then I took a bus from the other side of the border. So I didn’t have any onward travel proof if that’s what you’re asking. This info was really useful so I thought I’d add some more up-to-date info. if you’re applying for a visa in Hanoi the process is really easy as long as you have all of the required documents before you turn up. They’re currently asking for proof of entry in and out of the country as well bookings for your entire itinerary. I only had a booking for the first three nights and they asked me to show evidence of bookings for the entire month. I used booking.com which lets you cancel the bookings for free. For entry in/out I booked trains using trip.com (free cancellations but a $4 booking fee for each trip. I booked Hekou to Kunming (they asked a few questions about this one and asked for a bus ticket to Lao cai and I had to explain that I was travelling from Sapa to Lao cai and I couldn’t book a bus ticket) and Shenzhen to Hong Kong. Another guy who applied the same day managed to get a visa for 40 days (he asked for 3 months and had bookings for the first 40 days) and he used printouts of a skyscanner flight search instead of an actual reservation/booking. I wouldn’t bother turning up too early as there’s a window for foreigners which moves pretty quickly (30 minutes maximum waiting time). Pickup was three business days after I applied. Hi thanks for the infos and tips. Do you know if you get a fake ticket by plane and enter by train if the check it or it is somehow written on the visa? Why not just show them the train ticket?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/is-vietnam-safe/,Is Vietnam Safe to Travel In?,Vietnam,"It’s confession time: sometimes, I’m really scared to travel to certain places alone. Sometimes, even if the bus ride is 9 hours long, I dread the last 15 minutes because I’m going to have to rise to the occasion, watch the motorbike taxi drivers as they point directly at me excitedly, ready to grab my arm, repeatedly asking, “taxi?”, or any other tactic they can try to get a sale from the foreigner. It can be daunting, though it probably seems from reading this blog that I’m brave and I navigate these difficulties with flying colors. I’m not, though. Not always. Perhaps I left Vietnam for the second-to-last country I would visit in Southeast Asia because I had heard mixed things.  I was warned there were rampant scams, people weren’t friendly, and I’d have to always be on my guard. It turns out, Vietnam is now my favorite country in Southeast Asia.   I know! After all of the negative and scary articles saying just the opposite, how can this be so? Honestly, I was a little afraid that being an American there would cause some negative backlash, but I never lied about where I was from, because with all of my country’s faults and issues, I’m still proud to be an American (as everyone should be of where they’re from), and was glad to feel welcomed despite the turbulent past between my nation and Vietnam. One interaction sums it all up pretty well: A Young kid sat next to me on the public bus to Yok Don National Park (where they see very few foreigners) after sitting across from me, then moving to the seat in front of me, then finally summing up the courage to move back to the empty seat next to me.  We got to talking and I told him where I was from, to which he said,  “You know, the American war was very bad.” Me, hanging my head a little: “Yes, I know.” Him: “But it’s in the past now, so it’s okay.” He then moved on to another topic. That was touching, and let me know that the past is past. I think the most important thing to understand about traveling in poor countries is, yes, as foreigners we will pay more sometimes.  We will get scammed sometimes, and we will be frustrated from time to time.  That’s part of traveling and it’s better to just accept this than to get angry and bitter when it happens. I think it’s also important not to always listen to what I say.  Don’t listen to what anyone says.  Take travel advice and suggestions for just what they are – suggestions. Go places with a clear head and make your own decisions about a place.  If I had listened to negative opinions, I wouldn’t have spent so long in Malaysia, and may have never seen Borneo.  I might have never bothered with the Maldives because it was “too expensive and resorty.”  Those would both have been huge mistakes! So if you have interest in visiting Vietnam, please go.  Do it, it’s wonderful. Some tips: Have you traveled in Vietnam? What’s your opinion of it? — I have also heard very mixed reviews, probably more negative then positive and a few people have tried to dissuade me from visiting this coming summer.  But I have to say, reading your posts has really made me look forward to my visit and I plan on approaching Vietnam, along with all of my other travel experiences, with an open mind and a positive attitude.   It also doesn’t hurt that they have recently opened a Vietnamese restaurant in Glasgow that is aaaaa-mazing! Happy travels 🙂 Honestly, I love love LOVE Vietnam so please don’t let anyone tell you not to go there. Thank you very much. I glad hearing about the love of you with my country. I am a VIetNam people, i really introduce many information, many landscape, … of VN to anyone, If you come back my country, I can hope become a friend with you, becoming a tourguide for you, Together discover VN, street foods, ….. Nice to meet you. Thanks, I enjoyed reading this post 🙂 Whenever I hear of travellers being cheated or overcharged it always comes to my mind, that someone should create a post which has some common prices included in setting countries. So that one can have an approximate price 🙂 Probably there might even be something like this already, who knows. I’ve just not got around to search yet. https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cost-of-traveling-in-vietnam/ my vietnam budget 😉 I hated Vietnam.  I have been to over 80 countries and it is the one place I have absolutely no interest at all in returning to.  I found the touts in areas like Hanoi relentless.  We couldn’t even relax in our hotel room!!  It’s really not the place for me, but agree that others should make up their own minds – just don’t ever expect to find me recommending it 🙂 That’s a bummer 🙁 I didn’t really experience the same thing but I as I said, a lot of mixed reviews come from people who have traveled to Vietnam. People seem to love or hate it. Sharon, I couldn’t agree more. We are experienced and open-minded travellers who have been fortunate enough to see a great deal of our World and Vietnam is definitely not for us. We never were scammed (too experienced?) but despite constantly trying to gel with the place, we grew to REALLY dislike it and even cut our trip short (part of RTW). From the ridiculous constant horn blowing to the filth and lastly the cruelty to animals – we saw large fish literally chopped into sections to order and kept alive between cuts. Dreadful. Saigon was interesting for two days. The people who seem to like it are typical guided tour tourists being shepherded around or the backpacker “wow look at me on a bike having an AMAZING time discovering Vietnam” groups. I won’t be back. I stayed for a month, never taking a tour, and did like it. Locals were also kind to me, but there are a lot of scams, yes. I find that’s the case in most poorer countries I go to. I still loved it but it is a polarizing place. I have only heard good things, and this is like the 8th post in my blog feed today about Vietnam and how amazing it is…I think it’s a sign that it’s time for me to get there! Haha, there were a lot of other bloggers there at the same time that I was there! It’s a travel blogger favorite for sure. I’m totally with you – I LOVED Vietnam! It’s probably one of my favorite countries I’ve been to so far. I met very friendly people, never felt unsafe (or “hated” due to my being American), and didn’t really get scammed because I knew to watch out for it. Already can’t wait to go back someday! Agreed if you know what to watch out for you can have a pretty easy time there. Many bloggers say that they never got scammed because they know what to look for, but never say what to look for, or how they learned what to look for. It is frustrating for people who are planning trips. It would be great if the bloggers who know what to look for, would share that wisdom, especially if there are particular scams associated with specific countries/cities/locations. And if they did get scammed, ‘fess up and share the experience with their readers so we know it can happen to anyone and it’s not the end of the world, or cause to grow bitter. Maybe that is why they know what to look for. Thanks for sharing your enthusiasm for a place that is indeed polarizing, and therefore feels more risky to consider. I have talked about that. You can read it here: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/getting-robbed-in-berlin/ In this post I have a whole list at the bottom of what scams to watch out for. Did you read the whole thing? I’ve always been a little scared of Vietnam and I’m not sure why. I have travelled to other countries in SE Asia and enjoyed them but have been reluctant to visit Vietnam. Recently however a few of my favourite bloggers have been bringing its beauty and charms to my attention and it is moving higher and faster up my must do list. Maybe I will visit sooner than I expected. Same here but once I arrived I was so pleasantly surprised that I wondered why I had waited so long to go Completely agree I agree with this post 100%, not just as a general travel philosophy (go where you want and take all advice—even from travel bloggers—with a grain of salt) but as a specific testimony for Vietnam as well. On our original itinerary, we were planning to hit up Vietnam immediately following China, but we had such a rough time there that based on all the negative things we had read, we changed our minds and decided to try it later. When we did finally make it here, about 6 months later, we fell completely in love and couldn’t understand for the life of us where all of the negativity had been coming from. To be honest, I think that many of the pitfalls that people highlight about traveling in Vietnam are true for everywhere in Asia: taxi scams, theft, and foreigner overcharging are found pretty much EVERYWHERE on this continent. If you remotely have your wits about you, I can’t imagine anyone being fleeced too badly. It’s really a wonderful country (we’ve spent 5 months total here now!) and I’m glad more people are beginning to recognize that. A lot of people I’ve met in China have had it rough traveling here. I haven’t really had any of those experiences but it helps TREMENDOUSLY being able to speak the language. I completely agree that all of the scams that happen in Vietnam happen all over southeast Asia, so it’s really not limited to there.  Taxis the world over can’t be trusted, I’ve found. Except for maybe in Ireland.  They’re awesome. Cute story with the kid. I always felt a tick of guilt in Vietnam and I used my time there to learn as much about the war as I could. It was a big history lesson for me. I never lied about where I was from and most people never held it against me. I wasn’t always sure if it was because of tourism, though, or because it’s truly in the past. That being said, Vietnam was my favorite country, too. I loved it there and can’t wait to go back! Well maybe it’s both. Who really knows? Hi Jeremy,I was born and raised in VN before moving to the US, but can attest to this question. It is not tourism – the average Vietnamese you’d meet may not have even a second cousin twice removed in the tourism industry, but would likely never flinch at the fact that you are American and that your country was involved in the war. The generation born in the 80s simply just don’t care – to us, it’s a distant past, and while a lot of us are still affected by the government changing hand (eg if you don’t have “connection” in the party, it’s harder to get into good schools and get good job than those who do. Note: harder, not impossible. Times are changing), it doesn’t affect our daily life as much as it did our parents immediately post 1975. VN was colonized by several powers, and if we were to hold grudges against the US, then we’d also hate the Chinese (1000 years of colonialism), the French (100 years and so much brutality), the Japanese (see famine of 1945: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Famine_of_1945). Yet it is laughable to think we like or dislike Americans/French/Chinese/Japanese more or less than any other foreigners. (Due to constant threat from China, the average person may dislike China more depending what’s happening, but that’s current event, not history). In summary, foreign powers come and go. We’re used to it. We get past it way, way fast. Time to move on and ain’t nobody got time to worry about that kind of things when ya got cram school. I guess we have pride in our country instilled in us since childhood, but I firmly think people should be proud of who they are, not necessarily the mistakes others who share the same heritage have made. No country is 100% transgression-free. I totally loved Vietnam as well! I think it was my favorite country in SE Asia regardless of the scams, etc. You’ve got some great tips here! People should not skip the country at all! It’s stunning and rewarding! I’m going to SE Asia this summer, and I was asking a friend what countries to visit. He also said Vietnam was his favorite! So, it’s definitely on my list! Enjoy! It’s beautiful and the food is SO GOOD. Nice article. Many good points, I lived in vietnam for almost a year. Worked with tourists in Nha Trang, and heard a lot of annoyed people, mostly gripes from backpackers that had belongings stolen, and often because they where not carefull. In the tourist districts you will have an above avarage element of criminals. Mostly pickpockets and oppurtunity thieves. I had my belongings stolen twice myself, both times a lot of the blame was on myself.So be careful, and dont whine when the lady selling baugettes on the corner tries to charge you an extra 5000 vnd (25 us cents) over the guy in front of you.You probably earned more last month than she did all year.I loved tipping as much as i could over there. People appreciate it.Most people working in restaurants and bars work 12 hours a day, 6 days a week with 1 day off (could be anyday of the week) and they make from 1.5-3Mil VND a month.So it’s no suprise they want to get some extra money out of the foreigner that walks around with a phone that costs more than their yearly salary.But that being said, vietnamese people in general are incredibly nice. and especially people in the country side.And I cant wait to go back there.. Nha Trang is pretty bad. It was my least favorite place but it’s not real Vietnam, it’s little Russia!  I tipped a bartender there and he took my hand and kissed it, he was so surprised and happy. I have to say that I much preferred Malaysia to Thailand because I didn’t get scammed around every corner in Malaysia. Reading about Vietnam does get me worried that I’ll get really frustrated, but I won’t let it put me off going there. I loved Malaysia too. I wrote this to point out that I didn’t get scammed as much as some people said I might.  I think the key is just to know the scams so you can avoid them. Gosh! I haven’t been on your site for so long. I thought you had come back home.Vietnam shocked me in a way. It was so different from Thailand, Laos and Burma, but at the same time it was my favourite place. I went home for a couple months but went back on the road. I have no plans to do more than visit home every now and then. I’ll keep traveling for the foreseeable future 🙂 I went to Hanoi last July for business and loved it! The food was great, the people were really friendly, and a lot of people had dogs for pets which I thought was pretty cool. I love Hanoi! loved VN.  and on the scam-o-meter, thailand wins by a mile.  met wonderful people, and lost count of the kids and other folks who just came up to us to practice their english and find out where we were from.  sure, there was the taxi driver who had no clue how to get us to chinatown in HCMC, and the cyclo driver who ran off without giving us change, but there were also the folks who sent us rounds of beers at dinner and got us to sing happy birthday with them all night.  and the catfish soup that changed my life.  and the rambutans hanging over our heads.  and biking over rickety bridges through the Mekong delta sure that I was going in at any minute.  be nice to people, give them the extra 25 cents without worrying about it, and enjoy the ride. Very well said. I think Vietnam gets blamed for scams that happen everywhere. You really can’t judge a place based on taxi drivers and street vendors who overcharge. It happens everywhere. I know Vietnam Is a beautiful place to visit. I have seen in the TV channels and movies. Hope more and more people change their mindset and visit this amazing place. Vietnam is amazing. I’m French, and although I do agree that the “american war” was much more recent, French did occupy the country for quite a long time, yet I haven’t felt even the slighest agression or resentment. Concerning Americans, in Ho Chi Ming, which French still call Saigon, they do have the “Museum of the American war atrocities” … As for the travel tips, Vietnam is as safe as anywhere. Anywhere in South East Asia, taxi try to rip you off a few dollars/kip/baht/dong ! It happens even back in Europe when they make you take a longer route to charge you more.And yes, in Paris, you can get your phone snatched as well. So go ahead and enjoy Vietnam, there is nothing to be afraid of ! I did visit that museum fully expecting it to be as one-sided as it was. I did like that they didn’t blame American people, though, and even pointed out that soldiers were carrying out orders and often did not want to be doing what they were doing there. i was born in VietNam. I so proud of my country. i realy want every  friend fully understand my country. Many people in VietNam  very friendly and easy to talk, check information… When I was 16, my family of 5 traveled quite extensively in southeast Asia. When asked what my favourite country was on where i would go back to, Vietnam is always at the top of my list. Yes, the cities are big and busy, but the beauty of the country and the vibrancy of the people and their culture makes it so endearing. As discussed above, I am sure we were ripped off a few times, but with time we learned to keep an eye on things, take precautions, and let it go. You will be overcharged (or tried to be overcharged) no matter where you are. I would return to Vietnam in a heartbeat.  One of the reasons I love it its the ease with which you travel there. The country has a relatively sophisticated rail network and transit. Traveling to the far north, down the east coast, and to the south in the Mekong are all affordable and efficient. For a family of 5, we notice immediately where getting around is an issue and where it isn’t. There is most often an abundance of charming hotels/hostels/guest houses which we found to be carefully maintained and very reasonably priced. Another benefit is the abundance of wireless internet, a definite plus when trip planning as you go. Go in with your eyes open, and give it a chance 🙂 So true. The internet is great, it’s super affordable, transport is abundant, and it’s just beautiful. Plus, I ate so well there. It ticks all the boxes, really. I’m glad you enjoy my country. Were you nervous with the insane traffic? Yes, I’m not sure I could ever get used to crossing the street! Hi Kristen, I love this article and I love Vietnam too! That story about the young boy and the war might have made me cry right there on the spot. What a sweet moment. Thanks for sharing x Was definitely heart-warming and I am so glad I went and checked it out for myself rather than listening to what others said about it. What was your favorite place there? I loved the middle. My partner and I spent around 5 months in Vietnam. Loved it. Will probably go back. Only thing I wasn’t impressed with was the food. Got very sick quite a few times. I had heard from many people and had read and saw on SBS TV about the great food. Foodies heaven they all said – we didn’t find that at all. Very disappointed. In contrast the food in Thailand was sensational and cheap.We spent a fortune – so not really as cheap as you would hope. But I do t begrudge the money spent – I just need to get smarter with spending 🙂  – so we can stay longer next time. Whaaaaat?! Vietnam and Thailand are on par for me as far as food goes. Did you stick mainly to Pho or avoid the street food? I find that I’m much less likely to get sick if I eat street food. The food is fresh, super cheap, and delicious. However it’s necessary to learn the Vietnamese dishes and their local names. Check out legalnomads.com next time and you’ll have a better eating experience! Hey! I’m planning a 12-week trip to SE Asia, my first really big adventure – and your blog has been really helpful.  I wonder whether you could help me decide between two potential trip ideas: Peninsular Malaysia 2/3 weeksFly to Cambodia 2/3 weeksVietnam 4 weeksBangkok for flight home (around 1 week) (I’d wanted to go on to Northern Thailand but by then it’d be March, with the awful haze!) OR Banana pancake route:BKK – Northern ThailandA bit of LaosDown VietnamCambodiaOn to Malaysia I love culture, food and stunning sceneryNot crazy about going out of my way to see wildlife/beaches My original plan to go Hi David, Maybe i’m a little confused here but they look more or less the same! I just see Thailand added in for the second option. Truthfully you don’t have to plan that all right now. It’s easy to wing it in Southeast Asia and it’s what I always do there. Have fun! I feel Vietnam is beautiful and nice in general, especially the Northern and Central Dalat. I guess it happens to most Asia countries where they like to con foreigners as they think we are richer. I recently went to Mui Ne and had a very bad experience. Activities are extremely overpriced, and we even encountered thieves in White Sand Dunes.  But nevertheless, I still very much enjoy traveling in Vietnam. Things are cheap in general and the scenery is very beautiful. ? My favorite is Dalat and Sapa. I won’t hesitate to go back again, but I will avoid Mui Ne and HCM for sure.  Hey Kristin! Great blog! I´m from Uruguay and I´m traveling to Vietnam 20 days from today! I have a question for you. Do you have any recommendations for photographers on how to take pics and don´t get your camera stolen?  I see you in blog you say “NEVER take out your phone in big cities like Hanoi or Saigon” So I´m guessing you shouldn´t take your camera out? The main reason I´m traveling is to take pics… What do you think? Thank you!! the problem is motorbike thieves tend to ride by and grab it out of your hand. I think if you keep the camera in a bag that isn’t easy to slash and just take it out for photos, then put it back, you’ll be less likely to have an issue than if you have it in your hand walking around. Just be mindful in the big cities. i have read all the blogs about HCMC on here and i will be there in May for the back half of the month and first half of june, i am retired now but i think that because i am an easily offended man and i get angry quickly if someone scams me and i catch them doing it they are liable to be on the wrong side of my fists  so what would you advise please as you are from this country??  do not misunderstand but i love Asia and the people it is just i do not take kindly to people who do bad things to me, they tend to get their head ripped off   have a nice day++ Most scams in HCMC are sneaky and you’re likely to be robbed before you realize it’s happened. That said, I’d be very careful about being violent in abroad where the court system may very well not be in your favor. Dealing with police there is something I’d avoid. Hopefully traveling helps you to embrace love and harmony. Just be careful with your belongings and read up on scams first and you should be ok.  To clear up any confusion, I’m from the US, not Vietnam. Have fun!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/sapa-vietnam-trekking/,Sapa: Trekking Rice Terraces and Staying With Hill Tribes,Vietnam,"The fog was rolling in and the cold weather was biting at my nose.  My endless summer had officially ended. I was at the very north of Vietnam, in Sapa, about 10 hours north of Hanoi, preparing to go trekking with some of my favorite travel buddies. They sent a message through for me to meet them at the church: “There will be a local woman there to meet us named Susu but ignore that ’til we get there as apparently some locals claim to be her and kidnap people. Unless you feel like getting kidnapped, of course, then go ahead.” The day started off with a laugh. That’s just how that group was, and I loved every minute of their company. The trek started in the quaint town center, weaving through the markets where Hmong women sold various wares, fruits, and spices.  We would be trekking for a few hours to the outskirts of town along the famed rice terraces.  Then we would eat some local food and stay with Susu’s family in a traditional hut.  What exactly the day would be filled with apart from a long walk, some food, and rice wine, we hadn’t really looked into. In short, we had no real idea what we were going to be doing. But we DID know it was going to be colorful, beautiful, and an adventure, at the very least. As soon as we turned up a side path, things got muddy (and therefore more interesting).  In an effort not to slip and slide everywhere, I scrambled up the rocks and kept a quick pace. I’m a big fan of trekking and found myself far ahead of the group on the way up. “You’re like a man! Strong!” said Susu. I’d like to think this was some kind of strange compliment. Though most of the landscape wasn’t visible due to the thick fog, the immediate surroundings were gorgeous, full of bamboo forests and cherry blossom trees. Upon reaching our destination, we built a fire and explored the surroundings while waiting for lunch. I slowly turned my body as if on a rotisserie, trying to warm my otherwise freezing being. While walking down a misty path I turned to my friends and said, “can you believe what we’re doing right now? We’re living with a hill tribe in Vietnam! Every now and then I just have to pinch myself so that I don’t forget these moments.” The meals were mainly vegetarian, comprised of tofu, fresh vegetables, mushrooms, rice, and of course, rice wine. The children played, the women worked, the men drank rice wine, and we tourists were either busy sitting by the fire or trying not to get run over by territorial water buffalo while walking along the farms. That night, unsure of where exactly Susu intended on having us sleep, it ended up that we were all placed in the loft, side by side, in a giant spooning train (or as my friends called it, a cuddle puddle).  It was valentines day, after all. What could be more romantic? The following day, well rested and warm from the collective body heat, I awoke to a slightly less misty day, and an amazingly beautiful walk back down to Sapa, passing by the very famed rice terraces I had so hoped to see. They did not disappoint: Crowding around the fire, roasting chico-pies as I had done in Yok Don, trekking through glorious rice paddies, participating in the biggest cuddle puddle ever, and bonding with my new friends (whom I’d sadly part with the next day), was the perfect ending to an amazing month in Vietnam. Do it yourself: — Sounds like you had fun! And didn’t get kidnapped! 🙂 I’ve always wanted to see those rice terraces too! They look amazing!  What an experience, enjoyed reading it. They are pretty darn impressive. The ones in China are even more vast! I laughed so hard at the kidnapping Susu!! Too funny. This looks incredible! In theory I did get kidnapped! I slept at her house 🙂 Looks like you had a great time. Really looking forward to visiting Vietnam and it’s rice terraces. The look so beautiful and it is such a unique landscape really only found in parts if Asia. One of many reasons why I love Asia so much! Wow, that sounds amazing! Looks like you had a great experience! I’ll travel to Vietnam in October and I think I’ll go to Sapa after reading your article here:) You definitely should do some trekking around there. It’s so pretty 🙂 INtersting post and so informative! I will be filling this away for when I make it to SEA! Wow! I love the photographs of the women cooking. Their outfits are incredible! Good thing the foggy weather didn’t hinder your experience too badly 😛 They have such cool style! I was really happy when the fog cleared a little on day two. Currently in Sapa for three weeks volunteering so looking forward to doing some trekking as soon as I get over this manflu. Fanispan should be opening up soon too! I googled it and now I have mountain envy. Been doing some great ones in China but I feel like I missed out now! Hi just thinking which agency you booked for the Sapa trek ? I am still in dilemma of choosing bus or train (bus save a lot but seem dangerous )? can you give some suggestion ? I took a bus but a train is definitely safer. My friends booked the trek then added me to the reservation so I’m unsure, but pretty much any agency can book for you. I’d suggest shopping around. Thanks Kristin ! I like your blog anyway, Keep it up! =) Hey Kristin! We’ve been in touch before. I was traveling through Central America and now I’m in SE Asia, currently Vietnam! Anyways, I’m curious what time of year you went to Sapa? I noticed you posted in March but wasn’t sure if that’s when you went.  Also, how long did you stay in Sapa and how long would you recommend staying? Thanks so much! Jess Hey Jess. I was there for two nights over Valentine’s day (feb 14). Probably the coldest it gets there. I just wrote a piece on Sapa Vietnam and I just found yours (we had very similar trip haha hence the super similar title!) The homestay was lovely though wasn’t it? Beautiful cherry blossoms – I didn’t see those. Would love to go back when it’s green and lush. Looks like a dream! Home stays are always such a great experience. What’s the name of this lovely village? I couldn’t find Hmong in the Vietnam map… Ravi Sapa! The exact village I’m not entirely sure.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/phong-nha-vietnam/,Phong Nha: The Highlight of Vietnam,Vietnam,"The kids excitedly called out “hello” to me as I rode by. The mountains rose up out of the ground as if spontaneously popping up to greet me. The rice terraces seemed like a an endless green carpet leading to an eternity of natural beauty. Farmers smiled and raised their hands to make a peace sign. Our biker gang rode by, each person in turn yelling a similar hello or flashing peace right back. I’m speaking of Phong Nha (Ke Bang) National Park near Hue in Vietnam. Is this paradise? It’s darn close. Phong Nha wasn’t really even on my radar until I teamed up with my Vietnam travel buddy, grill master Double D, who told me about the famous caves in the area. I had certainly heard about all kinds of caves in Vietnam, but had no idea how amazing and still unchanged these caves would turn out to be. Apart from that, renting motorbikes and exploring the area for a couple of days in a row made this area the most beautiful, enjoyable, and amazing part of my entire month in Vietnam.  Here’s why: The Dark Cave This cave is accessed by either kayaking or swimming to the cave mouth, and requires a guide.  This ended up the most expensive part of the day, but was so much fun, we were happy to pay. The cave is darn muddy.  At first, I just accepted that, yes, I was going to have some really muddy feet.  Then my legs got involved as the mud got deeper.  Before I knew it, I was waist deep and, while rounding a corner, huddled behind a rock as a barrage of mud balls came raining down on me. It was time for a mud war!   Our group of five ended up practically swimming in the mud by the end of it, throwing mud at each other every now and then and finally just accepting the muddiness and fully immersing ourselves, hair and all!  The guide even got in on it, all of us laughing and playing like children again. When I finally washed the mud off at back at the mouth of the cave, I realized that as the mud washed off it left my skin and hair incredibly soft.  People pay good money for this kind of thing in fancy spas! If you’re a confident swimmer, bypass the kayaks and just swim to the mouth of the cave to save some money.  Do this whole thing in a bathing suit, or clothing that you’re OK with getting muddy and wet.  Paradise Cave Paradise cave is absolutely massive.  Unlike the cave visited during the typical Halong Bay tour, this one has no graffiti, has not been changed at all (the walkway is a wooden deck added in rather than a paved walkway that changes the natural flow of the cave), and the lighting is all natural colors, rather than the reds and greens I saw in the other caves. One could spend hours in here, marveling at the shapes and seeing various things in them, subjectively, much like cloud or star-gazing. At the entrance of the caves one can either walk or take a little open-air shuttle bus to the cave entrance. Enjoy the walk and save your money. It’s an easy stroll in the shade and not worth the extra cash to bypass.  The Pub with Cold Beer  This is known as the place where one can “buy a chicken” live, have it plucked, butchered, and then cooked for lunch.  Though I didn’t personally buy a chicken (it’s a 200,000 VND price tag), I was present when a few other tourists did. I have now seen a chicken from the living stage to the plate stage.  It was a little grizzly. That’s all I have to say about that. The drive out, though, was beautiful. Fair warning, the road turns into a dirt and rock road with lots of pot-holes on the way to the pub, then ends at a river that needs to be crossed on foot (or bike, if you’re particularly adventurous and confident). No matter what you do, if you are motorbiking be sure to have travel insurance – it’s just the right thing to do. The incredibly friendly locals in this area, and the natural beauty, made it very worth it. The awesome side roads  My favorite thing was getting lost on the little side roads around the national park.  The reaction from the locals was absolutely awesome. Much in the way that the kids ran out of their little shacks in Kratie, Cambodia, yelling hello, the kids (and their parents too!) did the same on the small side roads here in Phong Nha.  Honestly, what feels better than being welcomed every few minutes by the locals?  It’s my favorite part of traveling and definitely makes a place that much more amazing for me. The complete lack of traffic and generally good main roads made this an easy drive. Even better, a first time rider came out with us and fell in love with motorbiking, much like I had my first time driving myself on a motorbike in Pai, Thailand. It’s tons of fun! *All of the above can be done with a tour, but I tend to avoid tours and prefer doing things on my own.  I spent about half what the tour cost was, but am comfortable driving a motorbike, which is essential on these roads, particularly those on the way to the Pub with Cold Beer.   Do it yourself:  Another great article!! I’ve visited one cave in France like the Paradise one and even though it was not as big, it was beautiful. I don’t like motorbikes that much but I think I should learn how to drive ( and get a license of course xd) consering the amount of stuff you can do on your own if you can drive one 🙂 Thanks Leo! I don’t have a motorcycle license. They don’t care in Southeast Asia. They don’t check when you rent a bike 😉 That’s good to know! I just have to learn how to drive one then 🙂 I didn’t bother with that til I got to SE Asia either! You’re the best xd Oh Wow, you had me at mud war and then those cave pictures sealed it! Thanks for helping me plan one of our Vietnam stops! No problem! I’d love to hear your feedback after you go! Great post Kristin! The scenery looks stunning and it sounds like a place you could have a lot of fun. It’s incredibly stunning. I wish photos could do it justice Ah, the caves look amazing! Love the fact you stopped for a quick mud fight 🙂 Entirely necessary! I’ve added Phong Nha to my Vietnam list for July…it’s getting longer and longer!  I can’t wait to visit, it looks like you had a blast. I just visited the national park and loved it! The mud in the dark cave was absolutely fantastic. Next stop is Hoi An! I’m so excited, thank you so much for your posts, it helps a lot! I’m so glad you liked it! Enjoy Hoi An, I really loved it. Hi,great article.I will go there with my wife and our 4-year child. I would prefer not to motorbike with my daughter behind me. But I plan to come with a baby seat that can fit on any bikes (bicycle). So two questions:– is it possible to rent bikes in Son Trach ?– how far are the sites within the park ? Is it doable to reach Paradise cave by bike ?ThanksJulien It would take a really long time on bicycle but there are van tours that you can do and then cycle around the paths closer to son trach separately. We are so glad that we found Phong Nha! It totally wasn’t on our radar until we were planning a motorcycle route from Hanoi to Hoi An, and it turned out to be a convenient stop on our multi day tour. We ended up doing a quite expensive Paradise Cave tour, which was fun, but next time we are riding around Vietnam, we will be sure to DIY our own day in the park. Thanks for the great post 🙂 Definitely take a motorbike around. The smaller roads are wonderful! The pictures in the post were amazing and also the description was so much lively that I felt like I am with you in your trip. Thanks so much 🙂 Love the pictures! What kind of camera did you bring into the caves? That was this one: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/backpacking-asia-packing-list/I’ve since switched to this one: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/how-to-take-travel-selfies/ Great post Kirstin! I’m going to add in Phong Nha into part of my Vietnam trip after reading your post. Just one thing, would you be able to provide more details on the tours? Like any specific agency name that we should look out for when we’re there? I didn’t take any tours! I self-drove and self guided. Easy Tiger hostel offers them, though Amazing post Kristin! I’m going to Vietnam in two weeks and this will be a must stop! We are planning to go from Hoi An so… Questions:– how many days did you spend in Phong Nha?– do you know how to get there from Hoi An? Motorbikes maybe? Or too far away?  Thank you so much! So looking forward for this adventure!! You could motorbike there. It’ll take some time but if you have time on your side could be fun. I took busses in Vietnam. I think I was there for 3 or 4 nights total. Enjoy it! How long did it take to drive from Hoi An? Hard to recall now but I took a bus and it made a stop or two. A few hours. What a great post – thanks for sharing! We’re planning a Vietnam trip next for 2017, and have bookmarked this post for future reference. ? Thanks for the detailed post! I’m in Phong Nha right now looking into non tour guided info and this was very helpful! Happy new year! Can I get through the dark cave if I dont know how to swim? Also, do I need to pre-book a guide or do I get it there only? Can I get safety equipment and zip line fun there only or I need to prebook a tour? Thanks! They won’t let you go in without a guide. You can kayak instead of swimming. The cave itself is just muddy so you walk through that. No idea about ziplining. I didn’t know there were places to zip line there. Paradise cave is so beautiful! Your pictures are also great, especially the landscapes.Thanks for sharing! Reading this blog post makes me want to go back to Vietnam. When you’re in Phong Nha don’t miss Ruc Mon cave! I’m telling everyone cause it’s magical and not well known. It was just discovered in 2016 by a local guy, and they’re waiting to get it measured but it has the potential to be the 2nd biggest cave in the world (the biggest in the world is also in Phong Nha). There’s a few different tours for the cave cause it has two entrances, and the one I got to go on was so magical, we went on a beautiful hike to the entrance and had a huge lunch on banana leaves, and then spent a few hours swimming through the cave and climbing. We literally were scaling the sides of the cave with headlamps, it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever done to be honest. The guide brings a DSLR to take photos inside the cave and sends you the photos for free. And the man who leads the tours is the man who found the cave (and spent 2 years exploring it to prepare for tours). For us it was a more worthwhile experience than walking around in a lit-up cave with a thousand other tourists. It was much more down-to-earth, the family was so nice, and we even stopped at a local village on the way back and drank rice wine and sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves with some of the locals(: What an amazing experience! can you visit both places in the same day?  dark and paradise cave? Yep! Great article. I been in Phong Nha after reading this article and really enjoy these caves and the countryside around the little town. Once I was there, I decide to stay longer because I was offer to join a new tour to go further in the National Park to meet the local tribes leaving deep in the National Park. After a 1h30 car ride on a beautiful jungle road we started to trek from village to village and learn more about the life of these tribes. The village got electricity with solar panel since only 1 year (2017) and this tour started to operate in February 2018, before that no foreigner was admit in this area because it’s a frontier area with Laos protect by the army,  so the life of these tribes is untamed and untouched by modern civilization. On the way we swam in two amazing waterfalls and at nights we drank local rice wine in a little village lost in the middle of the jungle. It was such a great experience that I want to share it with you to let everybody know about that. If people plan to go to Phong Nha they should consider to stay at least 3 nights to have time to visit these tribes in the jungle. Nice how can they get there?

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/south-africa-road-trip-itinerary/,The Perfect South African Road Trip,South Africa,"When I arrived in South Africa I knew that I wanted to do a road trip across the country.  As my first foray into the African continent, I was sure it would be different than Asia where I’d spent the previous three years of my life, easily hopping from place to place on a motorbike or one of the many buses. South Africa wasn’t going to be as simple without plentiful public transport and easy local options, so a road trip seemed like the perfect way to take it all in. I arrived without any idea of how to go about this, or how to find a partner in crime, but things have a way of working themselves out. A few days in I met Callum from Canada. He turned out to be the perfect road trip buddy and, lucky for us, the country far exceeded both of our expectations. Daily, we’d turn to each other in awe of what we saw. The constantly changing microclimates and incredible amount of diversity really blew us away. Since then I’ve returned twice, adding more destinations in each time. As far as road trips go, this must be one of the best places in the world to do one. If you’re considering it, grab the opportunity with both hands and enjoy the ride. Here’s the perfect South African road trip itinerary: Self driving in South Africa is cheap and easy, and the most convenient option, IMHO. You can pay for services like Baz Bus, but once they drop you off, it gets hard to explore the area without wheels. If you share a rental with one or more other people, it works out cheaper and gives you so much more flexibility! If you’re looking for the right car rental, click here to compare options. For the most part, you can go cheap with the car. I’ve rented a VW Golf and a Ford Fiesta and both were fine. Apart from potholes, most of the roads in South Africa are easy to traverse with a cheap, small car, including Kruger National Park. You don’t need a 4×4, unless you’re heading truly off the beaten path. Additionally, I highly recommend getting a Vodacom SIM card when you arrive at the airport. It will help tremendously with navigating. Plus, WiFi in South Africa can be hard to come by. Finally, don’t forget travel insurance when you’re in South Africa! I love the World Nomads explorer plan which covers hiking and other adventurous activities. Without further ado, here’s the itinerary: Johannesburg is a great starting point for a road trip and with its rich history and the Apartheid Museum, a helpful introduction to South African culture. What I really loved about it was the openness and friendly nature of the locals, who are quite likely to invite you to hang out again and again. I love the vibe of this city. It’s easy to talk to people there and it’s a welcoming place. I might be the only person in the world who prefers Joburg to Cape Town, but Johannesburg has a soul that I really enjoy. Plus, if you’re there over a weekend, you can find wonderful markets full of friendly and outgoing people. If you have the time, I also recommend exploring Soweto, the biggest South African township. *Remember to be careful in the big cities in South Africa, though. Don’t walk around, especially at night, and don’t leave anything at all, even if it’s a cheap pair of sunglasses, visible in the car. Lay your head: I’d suggest an AirBnB rental. A few years ago, a local South African let me in on a beautiful secret: Horseshoe Bend had a love child with the Drakensberg and it’s called Blyde River Canyon. Exploring the hiking trails, God’s Window, the Three Rondavels, and Mac Mac Falls all along the Panoramic Route can easily take up a full week in and of themselves, but if you are just looking for a stop on the way to Kruger National Park, stay near the Three Rondavels viewpoint to get this fantastic view. Lay your head: Blyde Canyon: A Forever Resort It took me four visits back to South Africa to realize this, but if you don’t go to Kruger National Park you’re missing out! It’s so much fun to be able to go through a safari destination with paved roads and to be able to self drive. The best part was this could all be done with a tiny sedan! After being on safari in Etosha National Park, all throughout Botswana, Zambia, and the Serengeti, Kruger might actually be my favorite! There are a few other places where you can see the big five (Lions, leopards, buffalo, rhino, and elephants), all in the same day. There are also hippos, giraffes, zebras, lots of impala, honey badgers, genets, loads of birds, and tons of other animals I’m forgetting. To supplement your self drive, I highly recommend signing up for the night drives which you can book at your accommodation. Since the park is huge, I suggest entering at Timbavati, staying one night at Olifants, and then making your way down to Lower Sabie before heading out to Golden Gate Highlands. Be sure to go grocery shopping either in Johannesburg or Hoedspruit before heading in so that you can cook your own food at the self-contained bungalows. Lay your head: Book Olifants and Lower Sabie on San Parks official website Golden Gate Highlands is known for the sunset reflection on the gorgeous rocks, painting them gold. This must not be a place that many tourists visit because I didn’t see anyone else on the Wodehouse trail and our hostel was empty. If one were to stay in the nearby town of Clarens, surely there would be more people around, but it felt a bit too touristy to me and staying in the town of Kestell was way more fun! It’s one of those small towns that doesn’t even have a traffic light. If you do stay there, check out the only pub in town for some great conversation and a quirky crowd (meant in the best way). The park itself is ideal for some seriously impressive vistas, wild animal sightings (think zebras, ostriches, wildebeest, kudus), and the sunset. Lay your head: Karma Backpackers. It felt so cozy since it was in someone’s home, and I loved her dogs. Waking up early in the morning and heading out to the Amphitheater hike at the top of the Drakensberg mountain range, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it’s yet another gorgeous, 4-5 hour hike that will take you to the second-tallest waterfall in the world. Say hi to the horsemen from Lesotho at the top (who will most likely try to be a bit intimidating at first and ask for money, but will relent once you laugh it off and say you don’t have anything to share), run around the plateau, through the mist and along the rivers, and spend an hour or two at the top of the world. From there it’s an easy drive to the middle of the park where you can choose between the Cascades, Rainbow Gorge, and Cathedral hikes before heading out for a long 8-hour drive the following day. If you can spend more time in the mountains and do a trek spanning a few days, definitely do so. I wish we’d had time for that! Click here for more on how to prioritize if you’re short on time. Lay your head: Amphitheater Backpackers, it’s well-situated for the rest of the popular hikes in the area. The Transkei might be my favorite part of South Africa. Also known as the Wild Coast, this part of the Eastern Cape was absolutely perfect for skipping the makeup, going on walks with adventures in every direction, and becoming one with the jungly beauty. Many travelers, locals and foreigners alike, go to Coffee Bay on the Wild Coast as it’s a gorgeous place to hang out and there are plenty of other backpackers around. The hike along the coast from Coffee Bay to the Hole in the Wall is mind-blowing as well, as is the hike in the other direction to Mdumbi. A photo posted by Kristin Addis (@bemytravelmuse) on Mar 7, 2015 at 5:00am PST  I know I keep saying that everything in South Africa is ‘gorgeous,’ ‘mind-blowing,’ ‘incredible,’ and many other colorful adjectives, but that’s because it really is! I couldn’t believe how blown away I was by the landscape, especially given what I’ve seen elsewhere in the world. Almost nothing rivals this place. This is a long drive from the Drakensberg. Apart from stopping in a township along the way for some street BBQ, which we did a lot during our trip and I can’t recommend enough, the day was mostly spent powering through and avoiding potholes. Lay your head: I stayed at Coffee Shack but wasn’t that impressed.  Staff wasn’t friendly and the vibe was a bit off. I liked the atmosphere more at Sugarloaf Backpackers just down the road. A 4-5 hour hike away, Mdumbi is also a wonderful place with a great backpackers. Another gorgeous beach destination, Cintsa has idyllic waters and great cultural interaction opportunities, especially through Buccaneers, the backpackers there. One of the only Fair Trade certified establishments in South Africa, they give a lot back to the local community and bring in experienced volunteers and medical experts to provide assistance in the local township. I loved staying there knowing that in good conscience I was supporting a place that gives so much back. Just by laying on the beach and enjoying their gorgeous ensuite accommodation (with the above view!), I was helping in a small way, too. One could spend days or even weeks surfing, going for long walks, and swimming in the gorgeous waters in Cintsa. Lay your head: Offering a range from backpacker and tent accommodation to the more upscale but still affordable ensuite and family options, Buccaneers is the best possible choice. While at Coffee Bay a local yogi I met highly recommended staying at a permaculture farm in Hogsback. I’m so glad that we listened, because it was a wonderful place, a little slice of paradise. At first it reminded me a bit of hiking in Northern California. Until, while resting at a waterfall, a butterfly the size of my head flittered by, Callum unsuccessfully tried to pull a Tarzan on a jungle vine, and I heard baboons barking in the distance. This area is known for sightings of fairies and woodland creatures. After seeing the huge, bright dragonflies and butterflies that, from a side angle, really did look like fairies, I can agree. Spending a week here unplugged would be magical. Lay your head: Terra Khaya, the permaculture farm, is wonderful. I met such interesting people there, loved the communal meals, and really respect that the farm runs entirely off the grid, operating on solar power. The dorms felt so clean and free of insects, the private rooms looked pretty cool, and the outdoor shower was one of my favorite showers I’ve ever taken. Ever. I absolutely love this place. Most people would probably skip it or just pass right through, but it’s such a nice deviation and lesser-known alternative to the touristy Garden Route. Take a look at my nearly-poetic love for this place in this post so you can see, and feel, what I mean. Do yourself a favor and do stop here. Seriously. It’s so wild, so spacious, and so serene all at the same time. Deserts are special that way. Lay your head: The Rest Farm holds a special place in my heart. It’s great for lounging or volunteering in exchange for room and board. In the coming months various workshops will be taking place there, too. Nature’s Valley, an introduction to the Garden Route, was unfortunately a quick pass-through for us but one that won’t soon be forgotten. There are several hikes in the area that I wish I’d had a chance to check out. Top-of-the-list went to bungee jumping at Bloukrans Bridge, which is the highest natural bungee jump in the world. Lay your head: The guesthouse here, Wild Spirit, is seriously cool. It has a treehouse, drum circle area (with hula hoops because those are important, too), piano room, and a deck with a beautiful view. Nearby, there’s a dairy which produces nearly all of its own products (or sources locally), and serves a delicious and cheap breakfast. Unfortunately, because I wanted to love everything about this place, I hate to say that the dorms left a bit to be desired. They felt too cramped and old. I’d go for a private room or the campgrounds instead next time. Once you hit Wilderness, you’ll know you’re in the Western Cape. The circular huts of the eastern part of the country fade and make way for picture-perfect beachfront cottages. It’s not that one is better than the other, though I missed the rugged style of the east. To each her own, right? The sunset here wasn’t the typical orangey-pink sherbet sunset I’d normally think of to characterize a spectacular sunset. Rather, it consisted of wispy clouds, purple, periwinkle, and soft blues. The sky seemed massive that day over an expansive beach and the sun appeared to take hours to set. The day just didn’t want to end, it seemed. The waves on the sand mirrored the sky perfectly in a blurple (that would be, blue + purple) explosion. It was poetic. Lay your head: On the Beach Guesthouse The birthplace of Pinotage is a must-stop for at least a day or two on your way into Cape Town. It reminded me of a cheaper, more laid back version of wine country in California, and with better wine, if I’m honest. Take a bicycle tour from winery to winery, mix your own blend, and try a chocolate wine pairing. For more on how to enjoy Stellenbosch to the fullest, check out my guide. Cape Town is the place of models and movie stars, glittering frigid waters and a tourist favorite. The way Table Mountain rises like a towering giant in the middle of the city – as if life gathered and grew around it – is unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Outdoorsy types have an almost limitless amount of adventures to experience here, from day hikes to multi-day treks, various water sports, kite-boarding, diving, and shark encounters. I admit this is the most beautiful city I’ve ever been to, with funky neighborhoods such as Woodstock, and posh beachside neighborhoods such as Camps Bay. If you’re staying for a while, read our full listing of things to do in Cape Town. Lay your head: I’d suggest an AirBnB rental which provided a better value than hostels in Cape Town. The map below has most of the stops mentioned in this post. Click ‘more options’ below under ‘Cape Town’ to open up the map in your browser and make changes as desired.  While this itinerary certainly doesn’t exhaust the options, it’s perfect for a 2-3 week jaunt through the country seeing the highlights – both the better and lesser-known ones. Get ready for an incredible introduction to one of the best adventures in Africa. *Some links in this post are affiliate links to companies we use or hotels we have stayed at.

Asia first! :p Both! Holy Cannoli! These pictures are beyond amazing. I haven’t dived into Africa much myself yet, but South Africa keeps getting pushed higher on the list. And SO good to know it is roadtrip-able. I want to see all of these places! This is what travel blogs are for! Thank you! I was really glad to find it was so easy to road trip around too! Definitely want to do it again and explore new spots That Wild Coast though!! It looks like an incredible road trip. It’s my favorite part. Loved it so much there. Definitely not SEA prices. Will do a costs post, just for you 🙂 Hey Kristin! Just discovered your blog, I am obsessed! I follow a lot of travel blogs out there and I am an avid traveler myself, but all your experiences are dreamy and I love your writing 🙂 I am heading to SE Asia for 2 months at the end of the year and wrote down a lot of ideas inspired by your experiences. I am not even in Asia yet and I am already thinking about my next trip (of course ;)) and going to South Africa has been a long time dream of mine. However I never thought that I could transform it into a road trip! Love the idea!! I believe someone else in the comments asked you for the approximate cost of this trip, I’d be curious to know too if you don’t mind….  I see that you didn’t go on a safari which, while indeed quite touristy, is another dream I have. Curious question – why didn’t you? Not of interest for you, and too expensive? (That would be my issue mostly, spending more than half of my total budget on a 3 day safari! But once in a lifetime, right..) Thank you for all this info! That’s great, Coralie! I did go on Safari later in Namibia, Botswana, and Zambia. I don’t care if that kind of thing is touristy. It’s worth it! I did a 35-day overland safari and that included tons of animal stuff. It was a camping trip so basic but so much fun. Lots and lots of blog posts to come on that. So glad to read that! Ah, I’ve been interested in South Africa for a while and your post has made me wanna go even more! Definitely included in my to-go list now. God, I can’t wait to get to South Africa. Your journey looks absolutely fantastic, and I’ll definitely be using your post as reference when I go there myself. I have the added benefit of having a lot of family down there to stay with and show me around, but the data you give is so much more useful, as it is from the point of view of a solo traveler, which is exactly what I am. So great you have family there! You’ll meet lots of folks along the way too, no doubt. Kristin, are going to the Skeleton Coast? I’ve always wanted to go. It looks AMAZING, not to mention not the morm, and I know you love the beach. I did briefly but upon my SA return I’ll spend more time there for sure. Nice article as always!Have you done a post on security of personal belongings by any chance? Or are us novices unnecessarily paranoid about this aspect of travel? Specifically to South Africa I have one written but not yet published. It’s to come! Nice looking forward to it! I wanted to see the other parts of South Africa. I’ll check the touristy ones out later 😉It’s such a big and amazing country and I am so privileged to have seen what else it has to offer. Kristin, You have the perfect itinerary for my taste, but sadly we will only have 6 days to follow the same route. I understand that we will spend a good chunk of the day in the car but as long as the scenery is beautiful, i am ok with it. What is your opinion. Would it be doable? If i calculate well, it would be 5 hours driving per day. Is that accurate? Hey Agnes – definitely more than 5 hours per day. We had a few 9-hour days and we had double the amount of time. It pains me to say this but maybe cut out coffee Bay and the Karoo. I loved them the most but the road into CB is very slow and bad and the Karoo and even hogsback take you off the main road which will eat into your time. You’ll still get a nice garden route trip that way which is beautiful. Hey Agnes,  I’m sure you have done your roadtrip already and loved it  but to others who want to know more about travelling South Africa in six days, here are some tips. 6 days is well possible. I would suggest starting in Joburg and heading down towards Port Elizabeth via Bloemfontein; along the way enjoy the Klein Karoo and the Orange River (by camping on it). As Kristin says you will miss out on the heart of Transkei, which is beautiful, but unfortunately such is life that you can not digest it all. In going the route I picked you can stop in at beautiful little towns in the Eastern Cape that straddle the Transkei for eg. Nieu-Bethesda. This little gem in the heart of the Eastern Cape will warm your heart and it will need to – in winter it is really cold!  As Kristin says you can then take the garden route towards Cape Town, which can be enjoyed in zig zags too – Patensie and other Klein Karoo towns can be visited by darting inwards and then back outwards towards the coast. On the way, you can also enjoy the southern most point of Africa, Knysna, wine and ostrich farms and an awesomeness of landscapes that will leave you dizzy.  Remember to take the Outeniqua pass from George to Oudtshoorn (where my family is from). Landscape here dries out pretty quickly – and coastal jungle will become a dessert in just a few kms.Research some of the towns along the way here. You will not be disappointed.  As I said, 6 days is well possible. The route I have shared is no more that 2000 km and that is easy to enjoy in that amount of time. I host similar road trips – and you get some other hints by checking out myepicafricanroadtrip.com 🙂 I second the suggestion to spend more time in the Karoo and I loved Neiu Bethesda as well. I might even suggest heading down to the coast in the Transkei and skipping the garden route altogether. People say they like it because it’s ‘so European’ but that’s exactly what turned me off. I didn’t travel all the way to Africa to be reminded of Europe! Hi Kristin! I loved reading your story! I am planning to go to South Africa in Jan. From Canada and currently living in Seoul, Korea.  May I ask you how long you’ve travelled in SA and the approximate cost for the whole trip there. 9 weeks and it was glorious. I saw you already found the budget blog but in case anyone else is wondering: https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-does-it-cost-to-travel-in-south-africa/ Hi Kristin!I follow your blog and snap posts for months and always enjoy them!! Zascha  asked you in a comment about the cost of your trip. If you still have the detail of it, could you email it to me please? And also, what was the duration of your trip??I’m going there in May, and buying my tickets tomorrow, so excited!!Thanks so much for all your hard work which truly helps other people traveling and discovering the world. If you ever doubt about it, think of all the people you help everyday!! 😉 Hi Julie. First of all, thanks so much for the kind comment! Here’s a cost breakdown of my time in South Africa. I’ve spent a cumulative 11 weeks there and loved every minute of it. You’re going to have a great trip! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-does-it-cost-to-travel-in-south-africa/ Hello! I just discovered your blog after I booked a flight to SA for August. I had tentative plans to make it down to Cape Town and back to Johannesburg, but now I’m definitely inspired to road trip. I’ll be going alone because I couldn’t find anyone else to embark on the adventure with me. I’m curious about the days you traveled the longest. Were you concerned about driving after dark when going from place to place? Some distances look rather long and since I’ll be alone, I’m more wary of night driving in isolated places. Any advice would be great! Hey Christie, I think you’ll be able to meet people at the backpackers who will want to join you. I did that plenty and met others who also hitched rides from place to place. It’ll help you share the driving load and gas! I wouldn’t recommend driving at night if you can avoid it. I did a few times right at the end of the drive just as I was about to get to where I was going. Sometimes you can’t avoid it but do take extra precautions in Cape Town and Joburg. Have fun! Hi, Kristin. I’ve recently discovered your blog and enjoy reading about all your travels. As a South African I was particularly interested in your take of our country. I’m pleased you enjoyed it so much! You even managed to teach me something – I’d never heard of the town of Kestell before (near Golden Gate National Park) and had to look it up. You learn something new every day! Keep up the good work. 🙂 I’ve found that South Africa is a really beautiful country that gets an undeserved bad reputation as being dangerous. Parts of it definitely are, but not the whole country! Great write up Kristin, very accurate  information. I am a Saffer too and personally I am glad we have a reputation as a dangerous country. The result is we get quality travellers that want to see our country. Thanks for posting a really good blog post. True, the difficulty of traveling in a lot of the places in Africa in general is what keeps it lesser-visited and I think that makes a lot of difference! Kristin – this post was shared by a friend of mine and we’re thinking of doing this trip in December!  I tried to sift through most of the comments above, but how many days did you spend on the actual road trip from Jburg to Cape Town?? We have about 11 days scheduled for South Africa (nothing compared to 9 weeks and someday I hope to extend my vacation time). I see that you spent up to 9 hours/day driving…with the hikes included, how many days would you allow for this itinerary?? If we had to cut out a few stops, I see Coffee Bay was one of them. Which others would you suggest?? Thanks! Actually we were on a tight schedule and I think we did it in ten days. I had a flight to catch to another part of the country that I’d already booked. You may have to rush and cut some stuff out. I wouldn’t cut Coffee Bay. I love that place. I’d actually cut more of the garden route but I know that my answer is unorthodox. I just felt like I’d entered Europe in the Western Cape and missed the ruggedness of the Wild Coast Thanks so much for posting this! I’m also debating an 8 hour drive (coming from Lesotho) to get to Coffee Bay, it was worth it, right?Did you spend a night in each place? I’m curious on if you just flew through, staying a night each place along the way, seeing things are you drove, or did you dedicate multiple nights? I’m debating between a night in various places along the way, or fewer stops with more time in each. It’s hard to decide where since as you put it, everything is gorgeous!! I think it’s worth it. I stayed for two nights in Coffee Bay and breezed through some other places. More time for the trip would have been awesome but that’s not always possible, right? Decide where to stay longer as you go – that’s my advice. Thanks, I think I’ll take your advice and leave about 5 or 6 nights free to choose where to stay as we go, I wish we had more time but you know how it is… Totally know how it is. I think that’s a good buffer. I think we did around 10 days but really would have loved more time Looks awesome. We are starting to think about doing a SA road trip and will definitely plan on making some of these stops. If you could only do one, would you recommend Drakensberg Mts or Golden Gate Highlands? The Golden Gate Highlands hike that I did is doable in an afternoon but most of the Drakensberg will take longer, so I’d decide based on how tight your schedule is. One bonus was there was nobody at Golden Gate and tons of wildlife. Hey Kristin!Enjoyed reading your post (along with all the comments) My husband and I are planning a 45 day road trip in SA. In your opinion, would this be an appropriate route for us? We appreciate any help/advice you have to offer since we have absolutely no experience in this part of the world.Thank you! You should definitely also include the coastline from Mozambique as I’ve heard excellent things. The west coast is also supposed to be nice and you can spend more time in the Karoo as well. This is just opinion, but I would prioritize the Eastern Cape and those coasts over the Western Cape. More nature and it’s the path less taken. That sounds like such a wonderful trip, enjoy it and if you discover anything not on this itinerary that’s amazing please let me know. It’s my favorite country and I’ll be coming back soon.  Hello Kristin! Thank you so much for the amazing post! I’m so inspired that wet decided to do it too!  We are thinking to rent a car from jnb, is the cheapest mini car would be ok to drive all the way? Or do I need to rent something like a truck? What did you drive and which company did you use? Did you take full cover insurance from car rental?  Thanks!!! Awesome! I had a small volkswagon both times I rented a car there and it’s mostly fine. Some of the roles are really full of potholes so just be careful when you drive. Take the full insurance and actually I always rent from someone different. I just pick whoever is cheapest or happens to have cars! You missed Durban!!!!!!!!!!! I will definitely do this trip one day, probably starting from Mozambique. I did go to Durban but I missed the coast from there to Mozambique and I KNOW that I missed out! I want to go back sometime in early 2017 I think. my name is Kul Kapoorgoing to south africa for a month….starting from JNBwant to hook up with other travelers in south africa…. Every summer I travel to third world countries for volunteering. Ghana, Zambia, Malawi, Bolivia.This christmas will be my first ‘holiday’ in years and I decided to go to South Africa.I will fly with a good friend to Joburg to spend christmas. We would love to drive along the Garden Route and go to Cape Town.Where do you think we can start our trip by car after Joburg?I really like your blog and I think we will sleep at the Wild lodge as you wrote.We are so excited but also looking for ideas, placets to visit and lodges. There is so much to see but we only have 17 days… I would love to hear from you. 🙂 I did mine right from Joburg. Get the car there and head down to the Drakensberg and work your way down the wild coast. It is honestly so much better than the garden route, IMHO. This looks amazing!! I’m thinking about doing something very similar, so this is super helpful. What kind of car would you recommend driving? I just rented a basic VW – the cheapest they had. It was fine! There are tons of potholes but we survived. Hello Kristin! 🙂Your post inspired our journey completely! 🙂 Thank You so much for this blog. I just have one question for you or anyone else – did you book your hostels etc. before your roadtrip, or you just arrived and asked for a free room/space to sleep? We donť like ‘planning too much’ because we could be late on our schedule and then it causes unnecessary problems with booked accomodation… Sorry for my English and thank you for any reply! 😉  Katerina Yay so glad to provide inspiration! I called the hostels the day before I arrived. For dorms this was usually fine but if you want private rooms you do need to book much farther in advance. You can also bring a tent and camp at all of these places. Thank You for such a quick reply! I was hoping for answer like that, because we are arriving in one week. We are low-cost-travelling, so we don’t need some fancy rooms 🙂 And we will only have hammocks and sleeping bags, so we will se what is possible with that 🙂  K. We spent 3 months last year in the Western Cape and absolutely fell in  love with South Africa. We want to come back and explore the northern part of the country, so I was curious about your mention of  Golden Gate Highlands National Park and the Drakensberg (there’s also Kruger National Park and Blyde River Canyon which are worth seeing in that area).So much incredible national beauty in South Africa (and you also mention Lesotho which have heard good things about). Frank (bbqboy) and definitely hit the coast apart from the western cape! You have posted an excellent article. I was born in S. Africa and grew up right next to the Drakensberg. We left 21 years ago, supposedly for 5 years and never returned, due to our children settling down and now live in Scotland. Your article is very accurate and I can recommend any who read it to consider and visit some of these. Ideal places to enjoy the beauty and recharge out of the rat race. Thank you. I’ve loved reading your blog and look forward to our trip to SA even more. We are coming with our teenage children.  We’re definitely keen on a safari. Which do you recommend. Thks Depends on where you are going. LMK and I can provide company suggestions Wow Kristin, this is an awesome itinerary! I’m so jealous that I’ve only travelled like one third of what you did 🙂 Well, I have to return to South Africa for another dose of adventures and road trips, I guess 🙂 Happy travels! Cheers,N. This looks amazing Kristin! Definitely taking lots of inspiration from this for my trip in December. I only have a week or so to play with. Do you think this is enough time to get from CT to Joburg? That’ll be quite a rush. I would pick a smaller area to explore, and for me it would be the wild coast, but most people would probably pick Cape Town and the garden route. Though that area is beautiful too, it reminds me so much of Europe and not that much of Africa. Thanks for your reply Kristin. We’re actually spending a full 3 weeks in South Africa and have 10 days for the road trip. Hoping that will be enough but might have to omit the Karoo sadly as we’re aiming to make it all the way to Nelspruit. Did you have trouble with mobile signal whilst you were on the road? What did you use for navigation? Just maps/phone or did you pay extra for sat-nav in the car? We used Google maps and as long as you are connected when you plot the route, it follows you via satellite so you should be OK. You can also download offline maps with Gaia maps or maps.me. They’re not always totally perfect but I find they are helpful as long as you cross reference and make sure it’s accurate. I did it in ten days as well and the Karoo was something I went back and visited later. Hey! Great blog and great information about South Africa!I’m doing a full month long road trip and I’m particularly interested about your experience driving through the Transkei. I’ve heard bad stories about driving through some of the smaller towns in the area and I really want to know how you found it and if you have any advice for service stops and toilet breaks on the journey.Thanks in advance!Kirsty. That’s my hands-down favorite part of South Africa! What did you hear? You mean about the road conditions? Yes there are a lot of potholes, so watch out for those. I loved Cintsa, Coffee Bay, Mdumbi, oh man the list goes on! I did some part of your road-trip. I just can confirm that it’s a fantastic trip… Hey Kristin – Great blog post. Loved your story telling style!I am planning to travel with my wife and 2 kids (9&6) and we will be following the same route as you but backwards from cape town to J’bg!  We included stops on coffee bay and Drakensberg after seeing your post. Do you have any tips on what not to do when traveling with kids on the roadtrip? your suggestions will be very valuable. Also tell me if it will be ok to hike with kids for 4-5hrs on the Drakensberg mountains!Best,Suresh Hi Suresh, I honestly don’t know what it’s like traveling with kids so it’s really hard for me to judge what’s appropriate or not! Sorry wish I could be more helpful. Hi Kristen! Love your blog/insta so much! Was so useful for planning my Patagonia trip last year and looks like it will be just as useful for South Africa!! I know there are some comments above about the timing of this road trip, but I have just less than 4 weeks’ holidays and am hoping for your thoughts on whether you think this would be appropriate: 2 weeks for the road trip above, another 5 or 6 days for the Cape Town region, around 3 days to go up and see Victoria Falls, and then back for a 3 night safari in Kruger (doing this at the end as it will be April and therefore apparently more chance of seeing wildlife than in March). Originally I wanted to fit a week camping in Botswana in before Victoria Falls but am thinking if I try to squeeze it all in I won’t be doing South Africa justice! Thank you so much in advance for any thoughts you may have! 🙂 Hey Jas, I think that sounds good. However, how are you planning on getting to Vic Falls? Are you flying? Overland travel in Africa once you get out of South Africa can be painfully slow.  Also, if it appeals or works with your timing, I’m leading a tour there in October/November and we’ll be going through Botswana and up to Vic Falls. Chobe in Botswana is mind blowing for animals, maybe even better than Kruger. https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/womens-africa-tour/ Hey Kristin, Nice to see your post..specially at the time when I am planning to make a similar road trip in mid of this year.Just wanted to confirm if its really worth & safe for a ROAD trip with a 10 year old kid & an infant.We (my wife & I) are planning to hire an XUV from Johannesburg till Cape town. I am more concern about safety. It’s not the safest country that’s for sure. There are car jackings and break ins in the big cities. Always keep your doors locked and never leave anything visible on the seats, even cheap sunglasses. It can encourage break ins. You just have to be very careful there, sadly, but it’s a fantastic trip and I’d do it again, even solo. Hi! I recently found your blog as I was doing my own research while planning a trip to South Africa. Many other travelers, including you, have suggested to rent a car when exploring SA. Do you mind giving more details about this? Was it easy to rent the car at the airport? What type of paperwork or identification did they need? How much was it? How was driving in another country and on the left side? Do you have any other tips for someone’s first time doing a road trip in another country? I have traveled 6 months in Europe and just utilized uber and public transportation, so this would be a first for me!  Thank you! Hi Rachel, it’s easy to book ahead of time on Expedia or directly with an agency like Hertz or whoever you like to use! They need the same things you need to pick up a car domestically, like your license and passport. You can just walk up to the airport and try to get one, which I’ve done in Johannesburg before, but if you book ahead of time then you know for sure you can get one. I don’t have a hard time on the left anymore, but it was weird at first. Just be aware that you’ll probably hug the right side of the lane more than you should, since that’s what we’re used to, and always check your mirrors to make sure you’re in your lane. Give it extra thought when turning and follow the cars in front of you. I found driving in South Africa to be pretty easy and laid back. Have fun! This looks AMAZING! South Africa is on my list of places to visit, I have fallen in love with it.  Which Month did you do the road trip? Lovely article by the way. This was in January which is perfect because local kids are back in school so you get amazing weather but smaller crowds. Heya Great blog…..It’s a direct pitch for me to book a package for Africa’s Tour!!!!    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler. I'm Kristin, and my vision of a better world is one where more women are empowered and living out their dreams. Solo traveling is the best method I've found to become the best, bravest version of me.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/cape-town-itinerary/,An Insider’s Guide to Cape Town,South Africa,"Cape Town, affectionately called the Mother City, or Ekapa by locals, was long a “spring-break” destination for many of us who went to university in the slightly less exciting cities of South Africa. Like many before and after me, I decided to make it my base for a few months after studying to join the fan club of ex-students, ex-holidayers who could find no good reason to leave and CPT originals, born and bred between the mountain and the (freezing) cold ocean who remain loyal to the city. Few cities are so lucky to have a mix of the natural and the cosmopolitan, but Cape Town won that lottery and you’ll realize quickly there is something (a lot of things, actually) for everyone. Here are some things to do, see and look out for no matter your interests, budget and time in the city: You’ll come to notice within seconds of meeting Cape Town that being outdoors plays a huge part in many people’s lives here, and to my surprise it doesn’t decrease much in the chilly winter months (about April- October is Autumn/Winter down here). It’s also not limited to the super-fit as there are electric bikes, scooters and segways aplenty and hiking trails for all levels. Or you could just go relax at the beautiful Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens or fit right in with locals on their lunch break at the more central Company’s Garden.  BeachesCape Town boasts 10 beaches with ‘Blue Flag’ status i.e. the highest standards of cleanliness and amenities like bathrooms/change rooms. There are definitely more than just 10 spots on the 300km coastline hugged by the chilly Atlantic Ocean, almost all with views of Table Mountain, Lion’s Head or another of the city’s many peaks. • Camps Bay for a lively strip of some great restaurants and bars (and even some celebrity sightings),• Llandudno or Bakoven are where the locals will go for a sundowner as they don’t get too crowded in the summer.• Simonstown is where you’ll find Boulder’s Beach, home of just the most adorable penguin colony around.• Surfers take note: Muizenberg is where you’ll learn and Blouberg is where you’ll find the biggest, baddest barrels whether you’re taking them on or watching the pros at it at one of the numerous championships throughout the year. These beaches are ideal for other watersports as well, such as kitesurfing and stand-up paddling.   HikingDid you even come to Cape Town if you didn’t Instagram the life out of at least one hike? Alright, maybe you make the cut without the Instagram part. Either way the most sensational sunrises, sunsets, views and workouts lie in the city’s many hiking routes and peaks. • Lion’s Head: keep an ear open for the organized Full Moon Hike every month between October and April, or head up to catch the sunrise.• Table Mountain: you can of course climb this treasured mountain, which is in its own protected reserve – take the cable car back down after a meal at the restaurant or do the whole thing.• A personal favourite is hiking Skeleton Gorge which connects the Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens with Table Mountain running through a beautiful ravine up to the most beautiful views of the rolling hills of Constantia before hitting the mountain itself. • Hiking from Hout Bay Dunes to Sandy Bay – the country’s oldest nudist beach – is one of the most underrated routes but does not disappoint with panoramic views over the beach, an old shipwreck and the Twelve Apostles.  RunningAny and everywhere but some popular and scenic routes include Sea Point Promenade, Newlands Forest and along any of the several mountain/hill hiking trails or beaches. There are also plenty of weekly Park Run events around the city if you’d like some company.  Given the country and the city’s cultural diversity, there’s already a world of possibilities when it comes to food. Cape Malay cuisine will introduce you to some hearty meals with a South Asian/Middle Eastern influence and of course, this meat-loving nation’s most important social gathering – the braai (barbeque).You need not miss out on your favourite food though as it’s likely you’ll find it somewhere in the city, from Mediterranean eateries to Pan-African cuisine to vegan restaurants. LocalMzoli’s is the city’s most famous braai spot, located in the Gugulethu township. Pop in on a Sunday with your own drinks and pre-braai snacks, order your meat at the butchery next door and get down to local house music until it’s roasted and ready to go collect. A number of restaurants in historic Bo Kaap offer walking/cultural tours or cooking lessons on South-Asian influenced Cape Malay cuisine which you of course get to sample too. Pop in to Biesmillah at the top of Wale Street for a delicious takeaway and peruse the narrow side-streets for food and spice stores if you’d like to give it all a go yourself.Visit the farm stalls and markets in Stellenbosch for local honey products, Montague for dried fruit and a number of up-and-coming olive produce and the list goes on and on. International Literally any and everything. Sushi at Nobu (at a fraction of the price of other Nobu’s worldwide)? Check. Tapas bars? Check. Chocolate boutiques? Check. Look out for events like Restaurant Week where there are great promotions and special menus too. Cafés/ Coffices This is where you’re really spoiled for choice, as every area has theirs. A few personal favourites: Giovanni’s Espresso Bar, Greenpoint. Caffé Neo in Mouille Point (complete with communal tables and reliable Wi-Fi!). Yours Truly – choose between the cool hipster scene at the larger double-storey Kloof Street and the more quiet, cosy Long and Loop Street hideaways. Supermarkets make it extra easy to eat al fresco/self-cater too, for when you hit the beach or the beautiful gardens and hiking trails around the city.  WineThe Western Cape Province is wine country and the best of South Africa’s world-class wines are cultivated and perfected right in the backyards of the city. Wine tours/tastings with pairings:• Delheim Estate have a wine and cupcake pairing among others!• More interesting tastings include wine and biltong (dried meat strips, a local delicacy) and even brandy and chocolate at Van Ryns!• You can self-drive, join one of several tours which include transport from Cape Town or take the good old City Sightseeing Bus which has a dedicated wine route through to historic and affluent Constantia – the purple line.• The Franschoek Wine Tram is a charming tour which entails being coached around some of the dramatically picturesque Franschoek Valley’s top wineries in an open-side tram on six different hop-on/hop-off routes to different parts of the valley, each visiting eight wine farms. BeerWhere there are hipsters, there is craft beer and this city is not left behind, boasting its own strong craft beer culture. • Woodstock, Cape Town’s answer to Brooklyn or Shoreditch, is home to several micro-breweries to tour and sample as well as many events and festivals in celebration of the local brews. If that’s not quite your scene, many restaurants and bars stock locally produced beers. Check out Drifter Brewing Company for tastings of products including a beer aged at the bottom of the ocean and a delicious kombucha gin & tonic.• Kiff Kombi Tours run their own craft beer city tour, if you like to combine your ales and your sight-seeing!  From local history and art showcases to local architecture and Cape Town’s fashion scene, the city does a decent job of introducing visitors to the different sides of modern Cape Town that make the city what it is. MuseumsA vast selection of museums offer an insight into specific areas of the city and the country, such as:• the South African Jewish Museum in the Company’s Gardens• District 6 Museum with records and memoirs of an originally multi-cultural neighbourhood that was ripped apart by forced relocations under the apartheid regime• the Slave Lodge, where you can explore the huge impact and long history of slavery in South Africa• Robben Island is one of the most famous former prisons in the world where visitors today can walk in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela and many of his comrades in the fight against apartheid who were imprisoned here. It comes as a surprise to many just how close the island is to the city (it’s within plain view from Signal Hill and other high points) and just a half-hour ferry ride from the V&A Waterfront. This is of course a popular site, so book your tickets days, even weeks, in advance on the official Robben Island Museum website. Free walking tours I personally have found that a great strategy when exploring a new city is to go on a walking tour led by a local guide as early on as possible. It makes it easy for you to navigate certain areas during the rest of your time in the city and you get little bits of helpful and interesting information from the get go. Cape Town Free Walking Tours offers just that on three different routes in the city centre. Tours run twice daily starting from the vibrant Greenmarket Square and run solely on tips. Art • Cape Town’s art scene is currently still buzzing after the opening of the Zeitz MOCAA, the Thomas Heatherwick-designed former wheat silo at the V&A Waterfront that houses the largest collection of contemporary African art in the world.• Catch more work from local artists at Gallery MOMO in the City Centre, the Iziko National Gallery at the Company’s Gardens and the Goodman Gallery in Woodstock.Speaking of Woodstock, this lively oldest suburb in the country has become a poster-child for regeneration (and at some points gentrification) with its vibrant food, coffee and beer scene as well as being host to some of the best street art in town. Pop by for a coffee or a beer and just wander around Victoria and Main Roads.  First Thursdays This celebration of arts and culture lights up the city centre every first Thursday of the month when art galleries will open late, bars, restaurants and clothing boutiques will spill out onto the streets with their special offers and live music is in the air. Keep an eye on the official website or grab a seasonal city centre map at participating establishments to see who’s involved and what events are on. PartyAs can be expected, Cape Town has almost too much going on in its party scene, from Reggae-themed Trenchtown in Observatory with its crazy food and drinks specials to celebrity sightings at swanky Asoka in Gardens and Camps Bay beachfront favourite, Café Caprice (on a Sunday night particularly). Hip-Hop and R&B-heads would do well to spend some time at The Waiting Room on Long Street and head to Modular on Riebeek Street for some heavy underground techno/trance vibes. This really is an anything-could-happen kind of city, so take a walk up Long, Bree and Loop Streets to see what catches your eye or check in with Cape Town Magazine and What’s On In Cape Town for date-specific concerts, parties and events going on all over the city and its surrounds.  As if the city didn’t have enough for you to see and do, the Western Cape Province and the rest of the country has even more fun and adventure to explore, from the adrenalin-fueled to the relaxing. • Shark-cage diving in the small fishing town Gansbaai puts you face-to-face with the great whites just two hours outside of Cape Town. Marine Dynamics runs ethical, Fair Trade-certified dives with a marine biologist on every expedition. • If you’re into a more chilled encounter with the wild, try some boat-based whale watching in Hermanus, another small seaside town just under a two-hour drive south-east of the city. • Southern Cape Peninsula – Take the scenic 9-kilometre Chapman’s Peak drive, etched out of the side of the rocky mountainside south of the city to explore the Cape Point Nature Reserve right at Africa’s most south-westerly point. You can of course self-drive, or join a tour, some of which include a cycling segment through the nature reserve and entrance into the reserve and Boulder’s Beach in Simonstown where the fantastically charming African penguins reign. • Safaris – For many, a visit to some African countries would be incomplete without a chance at spotting the big five in their natural habitat, and you can do just that on your trip to Cape Town as well. • Aquila Game Reserve is a two-hour drive from the city and gives you a chance to experience the big five on half-day and full-day safaris which can be conducted in a game vehicle as well as on horseback or even quad bikes. Overnight stays are possible too in the cosy cottages and lodge on the reserve. • Sanbona Wildlife Reserve is four hours outside the city for that luxury experience in the wild with campsites as well as higher-end tented camps and lodges for overnight stays. Look out for the rare white lion for which the reserve runs a special rehabilitation program!  From local crafts and clothing to some of the country’s and the world’s top designers, there are plenty of shopping areas to explore in Cape Town. Check out the historic Greenmarket Square in the city centre for handmade crafts and curios by artisans from across the continent, the V&A Waterfront Mall for the world’s top high street and luxury brands and Long and Kloof streets for local fashion and homeware boutiques.  Weekly markets You could probably find a market for each day of the week, but the hits include Neighbourgoods at the Old Biscuit Mill in Woodstock for some gorgeous threads by young local designers, great food and sweet treats (Saturdays). Hout Bay Harbour Market for live music, plants, locally produced natural cosmetics and food products, clothing and even some old records! (Friday-Sunday). Get your health food fix in with the Oranjezicht Farmer’s Market at the Waterfront every Saturday too, if you’re a fan of quinoa, kimchi and other fermented products and super-foods. Also, more plants. Factory/outlet storesAccess Park in Kenilworth is the most well-known collection of factory stores. I’ve scored many a discount on Nike, Adidas, H&M and plenty more clothing, shoes and cosmetics brands.  Compared to other South African cities, Cape Town has quite a few decent and reliable public transport options, but of course having your own private car or requesting a cab are always available as well. Walk – Fans of walking like myself have a good mix of beautiful scenery and interesting architecture to pass by on the way to places, and depending on where you’re staying and where you’d like to go Cape Town can be very walkable indeed. MyCiti prepaid bus system – With routes to and from the airport, popular beaches and a great many of the city’s neighbourhoods and entertainment areas, this reliable scheduled bus service operates using prepaid cards. You can buy single-use tickets, or if you’re in the city longer than a few days get a card you can top up at any of the stations and some supermarkets. Minibus ‘taxis’ – This popular and affordable form of public transport seems to intimidate some, but it’s worth it to try at least one South African taxi ride. Flag one down almost anywhere (but at least try and stick to designated bus stops) and confirm with the driver if they’re going to the area/landmark you want to get to. Pay in cash (seldom over R15/$1), hold on and listen to the blaring local jams en route! Uber/Taxify/Cab companies – Good old cab apps and companies run 24 hours here just like any major city in the world. Ask for cab company recommendations at your accommodation if you’re not a fan of apps. Rent a car (or a bicycle!) – There is of course nothing as flexible and freeing as having your own personal car to go on road trips at your own pace or simply to be in control of your movement. There are several reputable rental companies with offices at the airport for maximum convenience. And there you go! Your beginner’s guide to making the most of your time in unbelievable Cape Town. The way life in this city seems to go though, it may well end up being more than just one time! The Mother City’s allure keeps almost all who meet her coming back for more effortless beauty, unique history and culture, great food, electrifying music and the people who keep it all turning. Don’t say I didn’t warn you if you end up moving there, or at least thinking about it. About the author: Julie is a 24-year-old architect/model/nomad from Kenya. After studying in South Africa for 5 years she’s stuck around for another year workaway-ing at hostels, exploring in between and writing about it all! Her content is a collision of tips and stories from travelling solo near and far from home and connecting with creatives who she plans and models in fashion photo shoots with. Currently she’s embracing the digital nomad lifestyle and deciding where to live next – the world is anyone’s oyster, right? There are so many more places I have to explore in Cape Town. I was only there for a few days but I’m happy I managed to visit Boulder’s Beach’ penguins 🙂 Thanks for this nice and pleasant post Julie. Really neat to see a different perspective on what to see and do in one of South Africa’s major cities (Table Mountain looks neat in the background). The penguins are major cool! Many people don’t realize how you can see penguins outside of Antarctica. In fact more penguins live outside of Antarctica than on that continent. In fact, you can find penguins in the Galapagos, and (Humboldt) off the coast of Peru, not far from where you will be having your tour Kristin! Apparently once in a while they make it up the other side in warmer waters off Brazil which amazes me. Did not realize that African penguins are only off South Africa’s and Namibia’s coastline (another kudo to Namibia!), outside of aquariums (have African penguins in our aquarium). Also, the museums look really important to see, and Robben Island reminds me a little of Alcatraz off San Francisco, being a prison view-able from the city, although it looks like a full island and green (Riker’s Island is another one, but it blends in and still is a prison today). Hey Kristin, if I want to send this comment for Julie to see, is this sufficient or should I go visit her site and say something for her to notice? Thanks! (Julie, if you are seeing this, great job and never mind 🙂 ) I’m sure she’d be happy to have you as a reader on her site 🙂 Hi Kristin: I talked with Julie and she told me that the website will be back up in a week’s time and for anyone interested to go to her Facebook and YouTube pages in the interim. So the link will be good again soon for anyone wondering! And she also mentioned Instagram, oops! I contacted her and saw updates also on Google+ (don’t want to play favorites 🙂 ).

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/africa-packing-list/,"An Easy, Fashionable Africa Packing List",South Africa,"“What in the world do people pack when they go to Africa? Where do I start? What is essential and what should I leave behind?” This was my question before I went to Africa for the first time, heading to South Africa with a backpack full of denim shorts and tank tops, kind of clueless about what was and wasn’t cool to wear there. It turned out that in most of Southern Africa, people dressed just like where I’m from in California – it’s all about fashion, feeling comfortable, and keeping it laid back. In Africa, you’ll see all kinds of interesting fashion decisions. I have to laugh to myself a little bit each time I travel there and see foreigners like me decked out head to toe in beige and olive green safari gear. They’ve got the vests, the hats, and the pants that zip off at the knee. Honestly, what do they think they’re going to need that for? You’re not even allowed to get out of the safari vehicles when in the wildlife areas, because of, you know, lions, hippos, and buffalo. While you can most certainly make the safari chic work for you by opting for the more stylish and modern cousins of the original, it’s also totally fine to go for the same cute clothes you’d wear at home, while keeping a few general rules in mind:  Shop my selection of the best clothes to bring to Africa here: Also, if you’ll be traveling to Cape Town, leave a little room in your bag to do some shopping. The local designers there are talented and have access to super cool fabrics, and the exchange rate, at least right now, is in your favor if on the Euro, Dollar, and GBP. I got custom shoes and these adorable shorts for way less than I would have at home. Each time I travel to Africa, I tend to bring my Pacsafe 55L backpack with me. It’s lined with Exomesh which makes it slash-proof, the zippers lock, and it has RFID-blocking technology so that theives can’t ‘bump into’ me and scan my credit card and passport info. I also bring along a smaller cross-body purse and wallet that has space for multiple currencies. They both have the exomesh, RFID-blockers, and strong zippers as well. I make myself the least attractive target that way. I also lock up my belongings in my Pacsafe wire mesh bag protector. Unless your room has a safe, use this to lock your things up. It’s very common to have money or items stolen in Africa. Sadly, it’s often pressure from local mobsters on the people working in the hotels, or desperation given how low the wages are in most of Africa. There are a few more absolute essentials that you should bring from home that you will struggle to find in Africa, with the exception of South Africa and major cities like Nairobi, Kigali, and Lusaka: If you’re camping, I highly recommend the following: Insurance, immunizations, and meds: Travel insurance is an important addition to this packing list because it keeps you covered in the worst case scenario, which is being flown to a country where you can get the proper care you need. I use World Nomads since their explorer option also covers adventurous activities like hiking and scuba diving. You might be surprised to find that in major cities in Africa, like Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Kigali, Kampala, Nairobi, and surely plenty of others, immunizations and anti-malarial pills are way cheaper and often don’t require a prescription. I always buy my anti-malarials on the ground (though it’s important to take them before you will be exposed, so plan ahead). Keep in mind, Africa is huge, and this list is meant for those traveling through the southern and eastern countries with some suggestions for the far north as well. If you’re just sticking to South Africa, modesty isn’t a big concern and staples like hair products and sunscreen are easy to replace, but as you head more north and east, expect things to get a lot more lean and basic and you may be shocked at how difficult it is to find things that are totally common back home. Plan ahead and you’ll have a blast! Enjoy the beautiful adventure in comfort and style, and not in head-to-toe beige safari gear! *Some of these links are affiliate links and BMTM sponsors. Anything you purchase helps to support this site at absolutely no additional cost to you. Much love!  Everything on this list is SO cute. I’m so not with it when it comes to packing right. haha. I ALWAYS pack 50% OK stuff and the other half is “wtf was I thinking.” I’m getting better though! I really like to safari shorts for anytime actually! And all the unicorn things… I need unicorn things! haha. I wish I was a hat person but my hair is too big. lol. Thanks for this info, Kristin! I used to pack pretty badly too but I’m getting a lot better now. Lots of trial and error! I love hats because that African sun is intense! Hi Kristin,Thanks as always for the amazing posts.Did you use the same Ariat hiking boots in Kyrgystan?Thank you! I did not, I used another pair I have from Quechua and they’re not as nice. Lesson learned. Hi Kristin,Saw this post and guess what, I’m currently in Cape Town and want to do a little shopping? Where would you recommend? I found some awesome boutiques with stuff made by local designers on Long Street and in Woodstock. Check out the Neighbourhood Goods Market on Saturdays too. Have fun! Hi Kristin, I’m planning to spend some time in east Africa alone next year – an overland trek, some time in Kigali and maybe Tanzania and a couple of days in Nairobi. This is the part I’m worried about. I’d like to go to the David Sheldrick wildlife trust and maybe a few other places and I want to stay somewhere inexpensive. Are hostels a safe place to stay in Nairobi for a single woman traveler? I think you mentioned them but they sound a bit sketchy….probably the stereotypical Nairobi fear that you spoke of. Where do you stay in Nairobi if just for a few days.Thank you,Gina I haven’t actually been to Nairobi but have been to other big cities in the area like Dar es Salaam, Moshi, Arusha, Kigali, and Kampala. I would just only walk during the day, and take cabs longer distances or at night. Ask at your hostel where is safe to go and where isn’t. Most hostels are locked with guards and plenty of other travelers, so I’ve felt OK in them. Have fun! Hi. I’m planning on a three months trip whatever I have time for of Malawi, Mosambik, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia. I consider going alone as a female 27 years old and will use my experience of solo travels through south east asia and tanzania with a girl friend of mine. I want to travel with hand luggage, but I guess that is not a good idea if I will have to cary a bunch of sun screen to some places!? I am typical scandinavian with light skin and blonde hair. Also I wonder what is the easiest way to get from country to country? Where should I begin my trip? Thank you 🙂 Sunscreen is a good idea, especially since it’s hard to find once you reach East Africa, apart from in big cities. You could just bring several small bottles. As much as I hate suggesting so many small plastic items, it’ll help you go carry on only. It makes sense to fly into South Africa and go through Namibia to Botswana and work your way up and east. Local buses really suck, but they work. You can also sometimes take trains and long distance buses, or join an overland tour. This packing list is helpful. I am off for Cape Town in April. Thanks Have fun! What did you pack for an adapter so you could use hair tools?  I would like to bring a curling iron or straightener but most adapters I see say not to use hair tools with them! I don’t own any curling irons or straighteners! Sorry I can’t help more. HI Kristin thank you for writing everything in detail. I checked overland tours from Kenya to Tanzania nd they are super expensive, starting g from 1500 USD. Flight is even more expensive. I am travelinging solo, what will be the best way to travel between Zanzibar, Tanzania and Kenya? Not sure how many days that is but if you’re solo that might be the best way to go – something like an Acacia Africa or G adventures is the cheapest. Otherwise you can do public transport but I have to warn you it’s rough in that part of the world. Overcrowded vans with bald tires and massive delays constantly.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/short-treks-in-south-africa/,The Guide to Trekking in South Africa When You’re Short on Time,South Africa,"When Callum and I started our road trip we had no idea where to go. We just knew that we had to get to Cape Town somehow, some way, within a two-week time span. We’re both avid hikers, both enjoy places that fewer people know about, and both love nature. Therefore, the next logical place to visit was Golden Gate Park and the Drakensberg mountain range in the Free State of South Africa – not far from Johannesburg. Though a 3-4 day backpacking adventure through the Drakensberg mountains would have been ideal, I had to get to Cape Town by a certain date in order to participate in a project I’ll discuss here later. It’s the great plague of traveling and movement that there is, by nature, limited time to see everything. It seems the more I move around, the more I become aware of and the longer my must-see list grows. Even less sensical, I go places and immediately think to myself, “when I return, I’ll do this! I’ll do that! I’ll bring so-and-so with me!” As if in some mystical future I’ll suddenly, magically, have all this extra time that I don’t seem to have in the moment. I’ll be able to move more slowly. I’ll immerse myself more. Shouldn’t I try to be more present? Show of hands, who else does this? We’re getting off-topic here but that’s something to marinade on. To bring us back I’ll start with Golden Gate Highlands National Park: This was the hike Callum and I did on day two of our epic road trip. We had really started off with a bang seeing wildlife and the origin of human kind on day one, and yet again we were in for a mind-blowing day when we started this trek into the Golden Gate. Even the drive to the park was stunning. We saw zebras for the first time, which was surprisingly delightful. There was all kinds of game running around the park – Kudu (one even barked at me) which is a very large, curly-horned deer-looking thing, Springbock, and ostriches. All of those taste delicious, I might add, and I extend my apologies if I’m being inappropriate by always wondering how a wild animal tastes when I see it running around. The hike itself is supposed to take about 4-5 hours and is easy to moderate in difficulty. Even if you’re not really a hiker, you should do this trail. It’s so beautiful that the reward for your efforts is well worth it: After the hike, be sure to head back down and catch the sunset as it reflects on the rocks below. This sight is how Golden Gate got its name, after all. Follow this map to get to the trail head:  Next on the docket the following day was the Amphitheater hike to Sentinel Peak and Tugela falls in the Drakensberg mountains – a UNESCO World Heritage site. Tugela Falls is the apparent second tallest waterfall in the world which straddles the border of South Africa and Lesotho. The day started off quite misty and we were a bit concerned that there would be no view, but decided that exercise is for winners and got to hiking anyway. Thankfully the mist cleared and we were rewarded handsomely: This hike, by the way, is an easy one and mostly flat. It takes around 4 hours round trip from the Sentinel car park but be sure to budget a lot of time at the top. The only thing to be aware of is, if you’re afraid of heights, the chain ladder that you’ll have to climb up, and back down again. I’m not very fearful of heights but this had me shaking a bit to be honest. Again, I really wish we’d had more like 3-4 days to do a full trek through the mountains, because if this hike is any indication, it would be stunning. However, if your time is limited like mine was, this is a really great way to see some seriously impressive natural beauty. To do it yourself, head to the Sentinel Car park on this map. Be forewarned: though they’re slowly paving the road, much of it is very rocky and difficult to drive on. We somehow did it in a Volkswagon Vevo, but we probably very narrowly missed popping a tire and it’s a good thing Callum was driving because I would not have been able to navigate it nearly as well!  If you find yourself there, I really liked Karma Backpackers as a place to stay. It’s peaceful, in a cute small town (with a really fun pub – check it out!), and the owner is just lovely. Have you hiked here? Is it on your list now? This is a lovely post I cannot wait to go to South Africa  So beautiful, I need to see Africa soon, seems like it’s been getting a lot of attention lately and just looks incredible. And awesome glasses by the way. Glad to see you’re doing videos now! Thanks for watching. I wish they got more views but it’ll come in time and I need to learn patience! I have never known much about South Africa – you make it look so beautiful! Thank you! It’s nothing I’m doing, it just is beautiful! I hope more people visit because it’s just stunning. These are amazing! The photos are simply stunning! The hike sounds amazing! And the views..ah! So gorgeous! was just so beautiful! Gorgeous photos Kristin. South Africa looks and sounds amazing. I’m glad you ended up travelling there. 🙂 I’m glad to be here too. It so is That picture you took of Tugela Falls is awesome.   Well done! I have to say that I’ve never had this massive desire to go to South Africa…that is until this post! I’m absolutely awestruck by your video and photos, just wow! Really enjoying your vlogs 🙂 Love that you’ve got Hakuna Matata playing too! haha That’s so wonderful, Simone! I hope you do come here and if so, let me know! I see myself spending a lot more time here in the coming years. Holy crap! That is incredibly beautiful!!South Africa, you’re now on my travel list 🙂 Chalsie | The Workshop Co. x Glad to read that! Nice trip report. It’s a lovely place. But I think the falls in your picture is eland falls. Tugela falls is about one km further once you climbed the chain ladders. Much much higher falls. Nope, definitely Tugela. You had me wondering but the Lesotho horsemen and the locals I met who were returning for a third time had confirmed in Person. Then I looked up eland on images and I never actually saw that one. I went as high as one could go. I’m planning a backpacking trip across South Africa now and loving all of your tips and tools for reference! Very good, detailed writing! I would definitely like to attempt one of these treks. Those chains do not look like they are for the faint at heart! Even for short treks, these trails seem to be quite a mouthful, you know, the things that can make one say “I have been to Africa.” Nice information and pictures too. Hi Kristin!  I’m wondering if you felt it was safe to leave your stuff in your car while you hiked?  We have large backpacks and would like to just take day packs on hikes.  What do you think? I mean in general it’s best not to leave anything of value at all in the car in South Africa, and if you must make sure it’s not showing. We were just out for a day hike so we didn’t leave anything in the car. Hey Kristin, I am finally embarking on this roadtrip route myself after putting you and Callum up to it, 3 years ago ;). I would love to repeat the exact same itinerary that you did. Drive from JoBurg to Wodehouse Trail and start hiking right away. Spend the night around there and then drive to Sentinal the next morning to do the Amphitheater Hike.  Now, I have been reading various resources and been seeing a bit of conflicting info. So would you answering a few of my questions so I can plan my days better please? 1. How hard is Wodehouse Trail hike, considering one would have to drive nearly 4hrs to get to it first? Would you advice a beginner to attempt it or not?2. Same question as above about the Amphitheater Hike. This one especially reads to be quite difficult in different sources. How much of an altitude gain does it involve not counting the ladder climb?3. Are both these hikes easily accessible to do on my own? As simple as driving up to the trail head and beginning the walk? Do you have to pay any fee at any point? Any chances of getting lost without a guide?4. I am guessing you’d suggest to start the hikes early in the morning but would it be too terrible to do start midday? Thank you so much!Archana Hey Archana!First of all thank you so much for introducing Callum and I! He was the best road trip buddy, honestly. It was so much fun.1) It’s so hard to say because hiking is subjective, but I don’t recall it being very long nor steep. I would say it’s moderate to easy, though it is uphill.2) It’s pretty flat up until the ladder climb. I think the ladders really freak out some people, which I get. That part is over quickly, though.3) They’re easy to follow trails. I think we maybe did pay a fee but it was small. I remember the road to Sentinel being pretty bad but it was under construction so it’s probably all paved now. If you can find a hiking buddy that’s always better of course.4) I did Wodehouse by midday and the other in the AM and it worked out well. Neither take all day.  Have fun!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/fish-river-canyon-namibia/,"From One River to Another, Leaving South Africa for Namibia",South Africa,"Leaving South Africa caused a stirring of bewildering emotions in my chest. This always happens when I leave a place: I start to get a yearning feeling in the pit of my stomach. My heart beats a bit faster. I feel a sudden urge to stay, along with the seductive pull of the unexplored ahead of me. It’s like an internal tug-of-war with a sentimental longing for the familiar on one side and inquisitiveness for the new on the other. Does it happen to you, too? I think it’s called a bitter sweet goodbye. After nine weeks in beautiful South Africa, it was time to enter Namibia, passing from the Orange River on the border to the Fish River Canyon in Namibia. You’re not going to believe this, but I chose to do so in a fashion that I haven’t done in eight years. I joined an overland safari and I would be on the truck for 35 days. That would be 35 days of camping in a tent, without a bed, 35 days of doing chores like helping with cooking and cleaning, and 35 days of living out of a locker on a truck. It would mean 35 days of someone else doing the planning, and being surrounded by other people, not so solo anymore. Yes, 35 whole days. Generally everything I do is solo and independent. I don’t like tours and am really not a fan of excessive hand-holding. However, I did my homework on this one and realized that if I wanted to see Namibia and the surrounding countries, it was the only safe option. I am adventurous but I’m not stupid, and traveling solo across Asia with its bus system and big populations is not the same as driving a car solo across a barren, shade and water-free desert without any mechanical know-how when the possibility of seeing another car pass by is slim and cellular signal is nil. What I liked about this overland safari with Acacia Africa was that it wasn’t an air-conditioned, fancy resort, fake experience. It would involve pitching tents, avoiding scorpions, running barefoot in deserts, and seeing lions from a big truck as we powered through Southern and Eastern Africa. In short, it was an unexpectedly sublime adventure with a few awesome 20-something girls and guys. I got along with each person, and honestly loved finally letting someone else do the planning for a while. As you may have noticed, solo travel was starting to wear on me and I needed a little break. Getting my stamp as I left South Africa, walking through the incredible heat to the other side of the border and entering into Namibia, it became real – I was saying goodbye to a country that was more transformative for me than any before it. As I do with almost every place I visit, I silently vowed to return. The landscape quickly turned barren and mostly tree-less. However this is the perfect environment for me. I love the quiet stillness and seeming emptiness of deserts. Despite the fact that they are inhospitable to most life, I find them peaceful and particularly beautiful. I love the feeling of the hot, dry heat on my skin. Perhaps because I grew up with it and it’s what I’m used to, this is my preferred type of weather. The final stop of the night and the first Namibian sunset took place at Fish River Canyon, the largest canyon in Africa. A hiking trail runs through it, which is one of the most popular in Southern Africa. That said, as much as I love hiking, I probably wouldn’t consider it. The temperatures there regularly soar to 48°C (118°F)! To add to that, in the dry season, the river is often dried up in certain parts. No thank you.  I was surprised to find that people actually run this, though, with the fastest runner clocking in at just under 7 hours for 90km. Through the desert. Without shade. Wow. As the sun set we sipped wine and took in our new surroundings. For the next 12 days, we’d be exploring this desert country, with pockets full of sand, walking through forests of leafless trees on their way to petrification, and in my case, jumping out of planes. It would turn out to be a welcome change, after all. *This post, and following posts associated with the trip, was brought to you in collaboration with Acacia Africa. As always, you will never read a positive review on this site for an activity, product, or destination that I did not love. All opinions shared are genuine and my own. I can relate to this statement so much: “It’s like an internal tug-of-war with a sentimental longing for the familiar on one side and inquisitiveness for the new on the other” – I feel like I’m constantly plagued by this affliction! Your South Africa posts have me longing to revisit, and I look forward to reading about Namibia. Namibia was entirely wonderful too and I’m excited to relive it through the posts! The bitter sweet good buy is what remains. We remember emotions not facts.  I will eagerly await for your posts from Namibia – one of the countries on my travel bucket list. So true and it’s human nature to romanticize the past although I really did find South Africa to be transformative. There were honestly good and hard times, though. Indeed, it’s difficult to leave a place you love, even if it was a short stay. However, Namibia does look amazing and I’m sure you come to love it too. Thanks Kristin, I found your Africa posts really useful.  I’m about to embark on an African overland trip soon and wanted to see how you had done it since I also prefer off the beaten track type travel. Rather than going it alone, I went for the overland group travel for safety reasons too – it’s reassuring to see you did the same. Hi Laura, I’ve done both independently and with a group tour now, and ended up leading my own group tour through Namibia too! https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/namibia-road-trip-itinerary/ I had such a good time on my first tour, honestly. I don’t usually love tours but I did love that one. I think it’s a good idea for a first-timer in the region.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/what-does-it-cost-to-travel-in-south-africa/,What Does It Cost to Travel in South Africa?,South Africa,"In this installment of Tips From the Banker, we’re looking into how much you can expect to spend when traveling in South Africa. This is a country that has the potential to be affordable to travel through, but make no mistake, this is not a shoestring budget destination. I spent nine weeks solo traveling through the country and, though it’s not nearly as cheap as destinations in Southeast Asia, which is really no surprise since it’s almost impossible to beat the pricing there, I still found it to be entirely reasonable. This is mostly because the exchange rate does those traveling on the US Dollar or Euro a big favor. At the time of this writing, one South African Rand is equal to 8 cents US. My total expenditure for my nine weeks traveling through South Africa was $3,577, or $56/day. This is almost a match for what I spend living in Berlin, and much cheaper than when I was living in California. Could I have done it for even less? Yes, I absolutely could have. I generally did not live on a backpacker budget in South Africa, because after two years of dorms, I just can’t do it anymore. Since now I’m more of a flash packer, working on the road, I’m able to spend a bit more. That said, regardless of your budget, whether it be high or low, I’ll outline how to live within it in this post: A guesthouse/hostel/tourist accommodation in South Africa is called a “backpackers.” Whether you’re a backpacker who likes dorms or more of a flash packer who likes to have your own space but still wants a social vibe, you can find what that fits your needs at a backpackers accommodation in South Africa. Everyone from gap yearers to families, and foreigners and South Africans alike tend to stay at this type of accommodation. They’re typically in beautiful settings and each has a unique personality. Generally backpackers have dorms that run from around $8-20 for a dorm bed and upwards of $50 for a private bungalow with a beach view. This was what I was looking at each morning from my ensuite room at Buccaneers in Cintsa, for example: To find the best accommodation options, I’d suggest talking to the fellow travelers at your first stop to see what they liked best, or you can check my road trip post for my personal favorites if you’d rather book ahead of time. There are also free Coast to Coast books at each hostel and tourism office in South Africa which lists accommodation and activity options. What I didn’t like about it is how every single place in there was made to sound amazing. There were no real opinions! It does make for a good beach bonfire starter, though. I also used AirBnB quite a bit in big cities, such as Johannesburg and Cape Town, where it was actually cheaper to rent a room with an ensuite bathroom than to stay in a shared dorm at a high end hostel. Unlike much of Asia and Europe, there isn’t much public transportation in South Africa. There’s a metro train in Johannesburg that serves a few places and a muni bus in Cape Town but otherwise, there’s nothing. I realized when going through my transactions that a lot of my budget was spent on Uber taxis – which is a smartphone app connecting drivers and passengers that is a safer and cheaper alternative to taxis. There are a few private companies such as Baz Bus, Greyhound, and Intercape that all provide transportation around the country, as well as an affordable train that serves many destinations in South Africa. Baz Bus is specifically geared towards backpackers and offers a 21-day hop-on hop-off pass for around $350, stopping at various backpackers accommodation. However once at the destination it’s difficult to get around, and the bus doesn’t run daily. If taking the other options, you’ll have to get from the depot to your hotel which will require a taxi. I’ve tested the busses, but feel that the best way to get around is most definitely to rent a car with several friends. Even when split amongst just two people, a car rental is more convenient and not much more expensive than any of the above options. I was very happy to have gone with this method for a few weeks myself. I go into every single option, the various costs of each, and how to find a road trip buddy in a lot more detail in my transport post on NomadicMatt.com, so check it out if you’re weighing your options. In order to save money, if you can be flexible and social, catching a ride with fellow backpackers and offering up a bit of money for gas is a great way to get around as well. Callum (my road trip buddy) and I provided some rides and I was a passenger myself using this method. Here’s where the big budget eater or saver can be, as food can be a big expense in South Africa. It would be a mistake to avoid restaurants altogether because the meat in South Africa is top-notch. There are opportunities to try game animals such as Kudu, Springbok, Zebra, Ostrich, and even Alligator. I sampled all, and all are fabulous. A fine dining experience in South Africa is still cheaper than in most Western countries, so do yourself a favor and splurge at least once! To save money, cook your own food. Grocery stores are plentiful and have reasonable prices. Backpackers accommodation have communal kitchens where guests can cook and store their own food. By at least cooking your own breakfast and the occasional dinner, you can save a lot of money. Backpackers typically also offer breakfast for around $5 and nightly dinners for around $8. Though there are some places you should stay out of for safety, especially at night, don’t fear eating in the townships. Ask locals which ones are alright to visit, but I would suggest Langa in Cape Town and Soweto in Johannesburg. The BBQ (or braai) food there is seriously good. Typically consisting of whatever meat you choose (go for the lamb or steak!), sausages, and pap (a fluffy maize dish used to scoop up the other food items on the plate with your hands), a filling meal can run as cheap as $3. Most of the places I visited were more or less the same in terms of pricing, except for one – Cape Town. Expect to spend a lot more on accommodation and food when in Cape Town. It’s a beautiful city with lots to do from nightlife to outdoors enjoyment, but you will pay a pretty penny for it. Apart from Cape Town, everywhere else I stayed was pretty much the same as far as accommodation and food costs. Perhaps the cheapest was the Karma backpackers in a very small town outside of Golden Gate park in the Free State. It was a house that the owner had repurposed and was a lovely little place to stay for a night. Connectivity can be a bit pricey in South Africa. I spent quite a bit of money on reloading my SIM card over and over to stay connected and work on the road, laying out around $30 per 3 gigabytes of 3G for my phone. Most backpackers accommodation will also charge for use of their WiFi, assuming it’s working at all. I should also point out that I spent about half of my visit in South Africa in accommodation that I didn’t pay for. I was lucky to meet a lot of amazing people who became friends, and was invited to stay in spare rooms on several occasions, only once with someone whom I knew prior to my travels there. South Africans are incredibly friendly and generous, so keep in mind that you may have similar luck as well! All in all it doesn’t cost a lot to travel in South Africa, especially if you cook your own food, stay in dorms, and hitch rides, but it isn’t necessarily an easy place to travel for those on a shoestring backpacker budget. If you can spend a bit more and are looking for a great value for your money, however, South Africa is the perfect place. I’ll be back for sure. Have you been to South Africa? What did you spend? Did my budget surprise you? Awesome info! Thanks for sharing – SA has come up a lot lately on my feed, and I’m starting to look into going. I’ll definitely save this for future reference.  South Africa is getting a lot of attention lately and it’s deserving! Such an excellent place to travel. Anyone want to join me in April Yes. When are you going? Where will you arrive? I want to do a road trip, from Johannesburg to Cape Town! I’m thinking April 14th- 28th or something like that, haven’t booked my flights yet and I’m somewhat flexible with my dates. Feel free to email me @ juti@rocketmail.com So interesting about Cape Town — I guess maybe similar to Luang Prabang, Laos where that one city is just much more expensive than anywhere else in the country (in our experience). I will be bookmarking your guide for our future trip to SA! I prefer to travel with certain comfort, so I feel like we are looking at about the same range of accommodations and meals. Yes definitely true that costs in certain cities are just higher and South Africa is no different. Same with Munich and Berlin – Munich is expensive and Berlin is cheap, or with London and the rest of England. The list goes on. I travelled in south africa when I was really young but I remember it being beautiful. Its funny that even though I grew up in Africa I never really think about backpacking there. I may have to change that 🙂 I can’t even imagine backpacking in Zambia though. I went through Zambia and enjoyed it. The people are so friendly. Hi Kristin. How to you record all your expenses ? Mobile App ? Excel sheet ? Something else ? I’m struggling to find an easy way to do it. Thanks a lot. I keep track each day in my head and before writing this post, went back and added up my ATM withdrawals and credit card transactions. For tax purposes I like smart receipts and if you can stand recording every single spend then you could use it to add up purchases. I find my head works just fine, though! Traveling on a budget can be a hard thing to achieve, but it is definitely possible. Thanks for sharing! Takes discipline that I’m slowly but surely losing, but definitely possible, yes! This is perfect! My partner and I are going to be travelling there in Jan 2017 – so good to read this, thanks! Enjoy and let me know how it goes! Hi LIsa!I’ll be traveling SA for the month of January as well! We should meet up! I don’t have any plans past the 9th of January (will be in Cape town at that time.) Are you guys renting a car? 🙂 Really good info thanks for sharing:) Pictures are gorgeous I am thinking about traveling to south africa soon and rent a car there, so find your post more than useful. Thanks a lot for this! What is the best month to visit SA on your opinion? January and February were great because it’s just after the school holidays end in December but the weather is still summery. I’ll be returning in November and expect it’ll still be wonderful 🙂 Hi Kristin!  I left a comment on your other post on SA trip, asking about the cost of the trip without reading this one!! Sorry about that.    I was just wondering if you exchanged most of your budget before you went to SA in rands or brought US dollars and exchanged it there.. I always pull money out of the ATM with a card that doesn’t charge any fees. I love Charles Schwab for that reason but it’s only available to Americans (not sure where you’re from 😉 I also used my credit card almost everywhere and rarely needed cash. I loved that I could build up my air miles and didn’t need to carry much cash on me. Just stumbled across your blog whilst planning my Africa trip. I am going for three months so really useful to know how much you spent. Glad to be of help! If you have any more questions let me know 🙂 Hi Kristin 🙂 I live in Durban, South Africa and I found your post fascinating. I think what you’ve written is true of our country and I’m so glad that people are wanting to come visit. Right now is a good time for tourists as the Rand/Dollar/Pound exchange has skyrocketed. As a response to the best season to come, the summer months are good but only if you like hot weather. I prefer April/May as it’s a bit cooler but still lovely. I hope all the people who have commented have a great experience here. I want to come visit in April and experience Afrika burn, so it’s great to know that’s a good time of year to visit, too! Durban can get sweltering, that’s for sure. Hi There. I stumbled across your post and I am so glad to see that there are still people who see the beauty in our country. Yes we have crime but it is not much different from other countries. Me, my husband and our 1-year-old will be going to Amanzimtoti in April and I do agree that it is a lovely time to visit. It is still hot but there is a cool breeze. I do hope that everyone who plans to visit will have great experiences and memories that will last a lifetime.  -Much love from a mom in beautiful SA!!! I love it so much, I went back twice! Yes there’s crime but there is where I’m from, too. I haven’t (knock on wood) had any issues in South Africa after spending a cumulative 10.5 weeks there. Hey! I love following your blog and your adventures on snapchat. I am actually from SA, but live in the states now. I am going home for two weeks, staying in Jozi with friends, but Im looking to rely on Uber to get around when my buddies are at work. How did you find it? Particularly in Johannesburg? Did you use wifi to connect to the app? I recognize you from Instagram! Yes I use Uber in SA and think it’s great. Every time I land in Jozi I just walk right to Vodafone and get a SIM card and use that to get around with Uber. Hey ! Am a high School Student from South Africa and I was wondering if you wouldnt mind sharing with me your budget amount ! How much you  spend on accommodation , food , transport etc all in one amount It’s in the post: “My total expenditure for my nine weeks traveling through South Africa was $3,577, or $56/day.” Hi, I am looking forward to travel to SA in November, with one of my friends,  hope the weather is good that time around. Just need to ask a few questions, Is Uber the best way to get around when in cities like Cape Town or Durban? Secondly, since we are on a tight budget, do you consider staying in airbnb rooms would be better in terms of cutting the cost? Oh yes, we are ready to cook once a day, be it dinner or breakfast. And lastly, could you please throw some light on the safari options available at Kruger National Park? Thanks a tonne! 🙂 I prefer Uber, and I have been in November and thought it was beautiful weather. Dorms are probably the cheapest but check out Airbnb too. You can self-drive in the kruger to make it the cheapest possible. HI I found all this information very helpful. I am planning an 8 week SOLO trip to South Africa to celebrate a milestone B_Day   ( #75!) in May 2018. I have no interest in renting a car so I must rely mostly on BAZ BUS. Budget backpacking places and cook some of my meals will help with my retired teachers budget. I want to get information on the least $ safari tours in Kreuger. Can you suggest any companies?Thanks in advance   Carol from the USA Happy 75th birthday Carol! You legend! You really don’t want to self drive? it’s amazing! If not ask around at guest houses Is it safe to self drive in Kruger? Visiting Africa is top on my list and I think that South Africa has the most to offer. If I got to visit South Africa my list of things to see and do would include: Safari to see as many animals as possible, visit the penguin beach, do a shark dive, visit ostriches and table mountain. Was there any other must see or experience things to see/do in South Africa and for those activities how to do it cheapest but still safe?Thanks so much! I mean I think so but I also do a lot of things people say are ‘dangerous’ Hi!Great information, thanks!Me and my friend are thinking about renting a car and driving from capetown to johannesburg. I’ve been in South-africa before and thought the Kwazulu-natal region was amazing, but it didn’t seem very safe… I was travelling with a bigger group back then and bus transport was arranged. Do you by any chance know if it is regarded as safe to travel by car through this region for 2 people in a private car? South Africa is not really a ‘safe’ country to drive through as there are car-jackings but they are mainly in the cities. I don’t let that stop me from traveling there, though. I would avoid driving at night, and NEVER have anything showing in the car whether you’re driving or parked. Even cheap things like sunglasses or a folder with papers could look important enough to steal. Always try to park in gated parking for the night and freely give anyone who tries to rob you what they want. Do you really think it’s such a good thing to hitch hike in south Africa?  With my experiences, I believe it’s very foolish, and to tell others to hitch hike and something happens to them while hitch hiking would be sad, maybe you should also add that it’s dangerous as well, so be careful.  Good luck love what you do!  Sorry if I said something offending, just thought I should help since I travelled to south Africa a lot of times. 🙂 I’m not sure that I did recommend it. Did I? I don’t see it in there apart from asking people who you’ve met at the backpacker’s accommodation for rides. I did that and I don’t see anything wrong with it.  But I’ve also hitchhiked all over the world and I’m a proponent of it. Everyone has to make their own decisions and is responsible for their own safety.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/wine-tasting-in-stellenbosch-south-africa/,"Get Your Vino on In Stellenbosch, South Africa",South Africa,"Each place in this world that is known for wine has a type that it does very well; France has Champagne, Napa Valley has Cabernet Sauvignon, Italy has Prosecco, and South Africa has Pinotage. A cross between Pinot noir and Cinsaut grapes, Pinotage is a variety of grape that up until recently was unique to South Africa. It was developed in Stellenbosch, a gorgeous wine region located only 45 or so minutes outside of Cape Town. Generally I’m not a red fan, but this smooth, earthy, and fruity grape has put Pinotage at the top of my wine favorites. Prior to my visit, I’d certainly heard that South Africa had fabulous wine, but what I didn’t know was how sophisticated and competitive with the best wines in the world it would be. The other thing I couldn’t believe was how well-priced the wine is in South Africa given the superior quality. A tasting is typically no more than 80 Rand (about $6.50), and most bottles are priced around the same. I still can’t wrap my head around how this is possible since Napa wine bottle prices are easily 10x that, but I’m certainly not complaining! Given my love for the Pinotage, it seemed logical to go to its birthplace. The following are the best ways to enjoy Stellenbosch, involving both wine and culture: Do you love wine? Do you love chocolate? Do you love them together? Usually sweets work against the palette when tasting wines, which was my main question when heading into the tasting. However the chocolates at Lanzerac have been specially developed to compliment each wine, ranging from a white chocolate with lemongrass with the Sauv blanc to a dark salted cherry-flavored chocolate with the Cab. Each chocolate had various flavors in it meant to compliment the paired wine and did so beautifully. They sure know the way to a girl’s heart. The winery also has a nice green lawn and over the weekends, Stellenbosch University students and locals come and enjoy the nice weather with a bottle and some chocolate. I’d never heard of this possibility before but in Stellenbosch, you can blend your own wine! Ben of the Momberg family-0wned Middelvlei winery came up with this idea as a fun afternoon out for a group of friends. In my case as I was there solo, he sat with me as I blended – a lovely afternoon and some great conversations. First we sampled Syrah, Merlot, and Pinotage, the three that would go into the blend. Mixing small amounts and writing down each recipe, I went through five different blends with various amounts of each wine, along with liquid wood (it’s a thing!), and a tiny bit of sugar, before settling on my winner. No surprise here, but by the end my blend was mostly Pinotage. Then, I put a Be My Travel Muse label on it and corked it myself. The whole experience was documented on Snapchat (@KrisLikeWhaat). Though in theory the tour is an hour and a half, I was told that the blending experience sometimes lasts all afternoon as groups get more and more into it. I was shocked to find out the price is only 135 Rand (less than $12) per person and 115 Rand ($10) per personalized bottle as well! Finally, finish with the Boerebraai (barbecue) which includes chops, chicken, sausages, home-made breads and spreads, and items from all over the farm. It’s really delicious! The Cuvée restaurant at Simsonig Wine Estate had a fabulous, delicious lunch on offer. Once again I was blown away by the pricing. Though just as fancy and high-end as a winery with meals starting at $30 per plate, cuvee has offerings such as ceviche of  farmed cob with cucumber, radish, avocado & cob crackling (pictured below), for a mere 80 Rand ($6.65). Main courses such as Springbok loin run at 170 Rand ($14). The accompanying wines are, true to the theme around Stellenbosch, smooth, rich, and easy drinking as well. If you’re passing through, definitely do a meal at Cuvée, but book ahead as they’re popular! Quite unfortunately Stellenbosch was experiencing a rather catastrophic fire during my visit. Normally I would have hiked around and this post would be full of photos of the gorgeous surroundings, but with all the smoke, that wasn’t possible. The fire is out and Stellenbosch is rapidly returning to its original beauty these days, however. The alternative was a bike tour around the town and Stellenbosch University, which took me back to my UC Santa Barbara days as the two campuses, full of bougainvillea flowers and white buildings, had an uncanny similarity. My guide, Raino, was a delight to bike around with, telling me all about the town’s history as a Dutch settlement and wine growing region. The tour (which runs at 580 Rand) finished with the above wine and chocolate pairing, since we’d earned it after several hours of cycling, no? I visited 4 different townships 6 times during my time in South Africa. The reason why I kept going back was because of the genuine nature of the people there, the great food, and the unique culture at each one I went to. The township of Kayamandi in Stellenbosch, initially populated by migrant workers, is a Xhosa name for “nice home,” a fitting name for a place full of many artistic souls. qJimmy throwing pottery at his home in KayamandiWhile there I met Jimmy who makes his living throwing pottery and welcoming tourists who want to give it a try. It had been ten years since I’d thrown pottery on a wheel, something I used to love doing, and it was nice to have that experience again in the most unexpected of places. I also visited a creche (preschool) for children of teenage parents. Previously, school-aged students with children would have to drop out to take care of their kids. The creche has changed all that. Founded by a woman who was in that situation and vowed to help others to stay in school, the colorful buildings are full of adorable children who chanted “teacher, teacher,” when I walked in. They showed me the shapes they were studying and then we all sat in a circle and sang songs. It was a touching experience and one I won’t soon forget. This tour and any of the above can be organized through the Stellenbosch Wine Route. A quick word on township tours while we’re at it: I was hesitant to visit them at first. I wondered if locals were really okay with people parading through their homes taking photos, but each time, I was warmly welcomed. Moreover, the tours I took were almost exclusively one-on-one with a guide who had grown up in the township. The funds from the tour therefore go back into the community, as with the example of NK in Soweto putting a good chunk of his time and earnings into an orphanage in a local shantytown. I’d encourage you to visit one if you find yourself in South Africa, they’re difficult, but eye-opening and heart-warming all at the same time. In closing, there are a lot of wine regions in South Africa that are worth visiting, but the history and culture of Stellenbosch plus the sheer volume of things to do and see there make it the perfect place to go and spend a few days getting to know South African wine. Each of the individuals at the wineries I visited were so pleasant to meet and speak with as well, which was typical of my experience in South Africa in general. As if there wasn’t so much to love about the place already, finishing up a glorious 9 weeks there in wine country was a perfect ending. *I was a guest of the Stellenbosch tourism board, however you will never read a positive review on this blog unless I truly enjoyed and would recommend the experience. Opinions are my own, and the wine really is stellar! It seems like everyone in the travel blogosphere is all about South Africa nowadays! I’m definitely planning a trip for later on the year, and I’m a huge vino – so thanks for sharing 🙂  It’s true a lot of travel bloggers have been on trips there recently. I really wanted to go solo and show the lesser known places as I did in my previous posts, though. There’s so much of South Africa that visitors have no idea about, but should! I love that part of the world! Shame there was a fire – number one, because it would have been awful for everyone living there, but number two because you didn’t get to see the area at its finest. It truly is stunning. And how awesome are the wine tours! We were truly shocked at how cheap they were and how cheap buying wine was. It was a shame I could only take two bottles back into Australia. Yes it was a pity on both fronts, but moreso for the locals, of course. I have to go back and see it in its green and beautiful glory! Besides, no harm in tasting more wine. Dear Kristin, thank you for the time you have taken to visit Lanzerac Wine Estate in Stellenbosch and for the lovely post about our wine and chocolate pairing. At Lanzerac we are very proud of our rich history and the beautiful location of our Estate in the Jonkershoek Valley. I am exceptionally happy that I had the chance to introduce Pinotage to you and claimed a new fan! Safe travels, Zelda – Lanzerac Wine Estate Thanks for stopping by and reading, Zelda! The wine and chocolate pairing really is such a good idea! Wow looks great, and so cheap! Never would have guessed. Did you get to try any white? My fave chenin blanc is from Stellenbosch 🙂 Oh yes, tried lots of white too! Tried all kinds. All delicious. Woah! I didn’t know wine had a special place in South Africa. Great post! And now it also has a special place in my heart 🙂 That is a great area to visit in South Africa, that and Franschoek…stunning. Drove through Franschoek and agree. Wow.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/south-africa-rainbow-nation/,"7 Reasons to Visit South Africa, the Rainbow Nation",South Africa,"“Everyone of whatever race, nation or creed who comes to Africa feels a magnetism that cannot be ignored or explained. Because it is primeval. Because Africa is like a mother calling her children home. Old, addled and poor she may be, but the pull of the umbilicus is still there. Irresistibly.” – John Ryan, One Man’s Africa. The Rainbow Nation was the name given to South Africa by Archbishop Desmond Tutu after first democratic election in 1994 after the apartheid ended. It’s a metaphor for the coming together of all of the different peoples who live in South Africa – a nation with 11 official languages. This is a perfectly descriptive name, not only because of the diversity of the people here, but the biodiversity as well. The constantly changing microclimates give a feeling of entering a completely different world constantly, all within one country. Allow me to show you: The Karoo is one of my favorite spots in South Africa. This vast bush land spans several provinces and is full of wildlife, sloping mountains, and red canyons. Pictured here is a place called the Valley of Desolation with tons of wildlife and great hiking. I know most people will think I’m crazy for preferring this rugged hot environment to the serenity of a beach or the magic of a forest, but the vast distances stretching from fingertip to fingertip, not another person in sight, give a real sense of peace and aloneness that I have not often felt before. Most people stop while just passing through, but this is a mistake. The Karoo is a destination in itself. Leaving behind the beach and trading it in for pine trees and giant butterflies only a bit inland of the coastal drives is a welcome change. The smell of the air morphs from salty sea to fresh trees. The sounds of waterfalls and baboons roaring in the distance reminded me that yes, we were still in Africa. The perma-culture farm I stayed at there (Terra Khaya) is completely off the grid, offers a beautiful sense of peace and oneness with nature, and best of all, this is the view from the outdoor shower. Looking back on my photos and remembering how it looked and felt to be hiking through the beautiful Golden Gate Park I’m instantly transported back to this lovely place. I had so many “Oh my God, I’m in Africa right now,” moments as I took in the vistas and layered green mountains. It’s easily one of the most naturally impressive places I’ve ever been. There were hardly any other people around, but there were plenty of Wildebeest, Zebras, Kudu, and bocks running around. Don’t just stick to the Garden Route in South Africa. Check out the middle parts, too. In South Africa, every now and then, you just stumble upon a fact that is so impressive you can’t believe everyone just talks about it so casually. Like, “the origin of mankind is north of Johannesburg,” or “you can see all of the big five in Kruger National Park”, and especially, “if you take the amphitheater hike in the Drakensberg, you’ll see the second tallest waterfall in the world.” The day before, I didn’t even know it existed. A few hours in, I was across from this magnificent site with horsemen from Lesotho making peace signs and taking selfies with me. It’s all in a normal day’s fun in South Africa. Enter: Perfection. I passed through Coffee Bay briefly on my South Africa road trip, but with some time left over at the end of my second month in the country I thought about the places I really wanted to return to, and this place kept popping back into my head. I found myself there for nine additional days, unable to uproot myself. Turn in any direction and take a walk and it’s just gorgeous and green. The round and brightly colored houses typical to the area give it such a unique look. Cows laze away on the sand. The water is rough but warm enough to swim in. There are cliffs for jumping off of, and holes in limestone walls for swimming through. When I go back to the rainbow nation, I know what will be on my list again and again. Indigo is the color of the rainbow that the human eye can’t see, but we know it’s there. The same goes for the friendly vibes and welcoming nature of South Africans – it’s something you feel. I’ll never forget the time when my road trip buddy and I stopped for some street-side BBQ next to a metal shack on our way to the Drakensberg. At first the cook was a bit surprised to see us, but turned to all smiles when he realized we were foreigners interested in trying his food. His mother came out and was so delighted to have international guests, she took down my email address and invited me to stay if I ever returned to her town. She even followed up a few days later, extending the invitation once again. I don’t think I’ll ever forget that. Not her kindness nor her smile. Cape Town is hands-down one of the most beautiful cities in the world. A giant mountain rises up from the middle, and doesn’t quit until it circles the coast right out of the city. The sunsets there are just incredible, whether from the top of Table Mountain or from Camps Bay below. — It used to be that when I was asked about my favorite country to travel in I’d have a hard time answering the question. They all have things that are great for certain interests, like hiking, beaches, or culture. However, now I have no problem answering that question: South Africa. Regardless of what you’re looking for in a vacation, chances are you’ll find it there. It really has everything. Expect to see me back soon, Rainbow Nation. Have you been to South Africa? What was your favorite part? My home country certainly is beautiful! Really enjoyed your post 🙂 Thank you! SO very beautiful. Traveling in South Africa was awesome. I love the way you used a rainbow photo essay to tell the story of your visit to South Africa. Also, WOW, your favorite country in the world?! Bold statement that has me super keen to visit. Tom and I always get asked that question too (I think every traveler does) and can’t imagine a country blowing our mind so hard that we’d have an actual response! I always figured I’d be unable to answer that question too, but I loved it so much there and find it to be so complex and interesting that for now, yes, it’s my favorite. So much to keep learning and seeing in South Africa. I love that. South Africa has always been high up on my travel bucketlist! After reading this list I think Coffee Bay and Drakensburg Mountains are a must-see. If you are looking for a great travel vlogger I suggest Ben Brown, he currently resonates in Cape Town and has been vlogging his experiences in South Affrica and capturing each aspect of the rainbow. Thanks so much for the vlogger suggestion. It can only help me to improve my videos! Yes those two areas of South Africa were highlights for me – especially Coffee Bay I feel fortunate to have seen as much as I did of South Africa, but my thirst is not quenched! Still need to see so much more! I have visited Kruger Park by passing the border with Mozambique. I knew that the rest of South Africa is beautiful, but not that much! Thanks for sharing this post. It inspires and definitely make me feel nostalgic. 🙂 South Africa totally blew me away with this! I didn’t know it had this either. I hear great things about Mozambique and am thinking of a return to see both. Great post! So many beautiful places, and that’s only the beginning! The kalahari, the Isimangaliso wetland park, the famous Kruger National Park and adjacent Sabi Sand game reserve, the scenic Panorama Route, the peaceful Garden Route, the ancient Mapungubwe National Park, the majestic Augrabies falls, one could go on and on! Hi.  Great post! Lovely to be reminded of the beauty of my home country, especially while we are going through such a rough time.Green and Blue will always be my fav. I love hiking Sani Pass and if I am not in the mountains, to the sea I go. Love the way you have written your article, its just the best! I can’t wait to read more from you.  #LoveandTravelHugsCee (Your fellow South African Blogger) I love hearing from native South Africans that they like what I’ve written about their home country! Green and blue might be my favorites too, though I really did enjoy the Karoo. Yes! I have a friend who was just living in SA and I am dying to get out there and explore. Another thing to add to the list- the sailing in Cape town is (allegedly) unreal and awesome!! Can’t wait to make my way down there, it’s on the ever growing list! haha I didn’t try sailing in Cape Town. I can imagine it being awesome. It’s on the list! what an amazing country and nationive been to kruger park which was an unforgittable experiance and gladly i managed to see all the big five 🙂 even though i know its beautiful i didnt even imagine the rest of places to be so amazing like this. i toke a one and half hour ride of a sailboat in the atlantic around the sunset in capetown, belive me nothing beats that ride. it is just the most beatiful sunset i ever seen. mozambique and kruger are in my to do list in the next three years or so. amazing country, people and weather. I think a lot of people visit South Africa and only go to Kruger Park and Cape Town so I really want to show how much amazing stuff there is besides those places, and even outside of the garden route, because there really is so much beauty! I had seen other bloggers as well which inspired me to go, but ended up visiting mostly different places than them since our interests are different and I like off the beaten path stuff. South Africa really has something for everyone! Oh, I love this so much. It makes me miss SA, especially Hogsback, so much! Hogsback was beautiful! I didn’t expect to feel like I was in a pine forest in SA! Love your thoughts in this piece and how you developed your story.  The coast and the Indigo reference were my favorites.  Your photos tell a wonderful story along this journey. Such a heartwarming post!   I’m South African but have been living in China for the last two years. I’m strongly considering doing an open-ended wander around the world at the end of my time in China.   Your blog’s been great to read and when I stumbled upon this post, it transported me right back to SA.So happy that you loved it and got to experience the amazing nature, kindness and food of SA. Hope your journey continues to be fantastic, testing and rewarding. Thanks for a great blog! Hi from Johannesburg! I couldn’t stay away 😉China is awesome too, and I hope you enjoy your open-ended journey! You’re in for a treat. Must be cool to know that you’ll eventually come home to such a beautiful place. FYI – It was Nelson Mandela that was the first president of RSA after Apartheid; not Desmond Tutu.  They are both great men, but not the same. I know 🙂 I didn’t say he was the first president anywhere in this post. This is a really wonderful ode to South Africa and made me rather emotional. Thank you for sharing the positives about such a spectacular place. Beautifully written! Aw so glad you like it! Awww!! Amazing blog!! I really loved this blog, Would love to explore it soon!!

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/tallest-bungee-jump-south-africa/,Taking a Long Walk Off a Short Bridge: The World’s Tallest Bungee Jump,South Africa,"To be more correct, the bungee jump at Bloukran’s Bridge is the “highest commercial natural bungee jump in the world,” at 216 meters (709 feet) of free-fall. Rivaled only by the jump in Macau, which has regulated speed so that you don’t slam into the building, it’s the tallest commercial jump in the world. This means you could go take your own bungee and jump off of something taller, but I don’t have one of those so this sounded like a nice alternative. I’ve been searching for something over the past few years that will really get my adrenaline going. I found getting a tattoo to be really thrilling (in fact I went and got three more!), but the feeling of my stomach hitting my throat wasn’t involved. I like that feeling. I thought maybe I’d get it by running off a cliff and hurling myself into thin air when paragliding in Nepal, but honestly, it was boring. Yep, boring. Would bungee jumping give me that feeling I’ve been seeking? That ‘holy-shit-I’m-alive-and-so-in-this-moment’ feeling of plunging face-first towards the ground? There was only one way to find out. Somewhere around day 12 of the road trip between Johannesburg and Cape Town, Callum (my road trip buddy) and I naturally passed through the town where the jump is located. It seemed a waste of an opportunity not to give it a try. We talked about it casually in the days leading up to reaching the bridge. I said I’d do it without really thinking about it. One afternoon, as we made our way through relative nothingness on the endless road, I had time to think about it. I started to feel anxiety, blamed it on having too much caffeine (does too much coffee do that to you, too?), and put it out of my mind.  I had to forget about it until the moment of launching or I knew I’d never jump. What really helped was the music played at the top while we each waited for our turn. It made it feel like a party atmosphere and the employees were all so relaxed, it translated well to the rest of us. I was oddly emotionless when my turn came. I was trying mentally to be somewhere else, electing not to consider that I was about to defy logic and basic human instinct by taking those steps and jumping off of a bridge. I’d always said I could sky dive, but not bungee. If you sky dive, someone else does the scary jumping part for you, but with bungee jumping, it has to be you. I always found that to be a terrifying concept. I’m not sure how or when my mind changed regarding this. Now I won’t say my heart wasn’t thumping. However the 100% safety record calmed me a bit. As long as I didn’t look down, I was feeling alright. The initial launch felt surreal. I had been denying it and avoiding it so much that my body only seemed to realize that it was headed with all deliberate speed towards the ground a few milliseconds after the jump.  A surge of adrenaline coursed through me and quickly left as I hit the bottom, then reappeared as the elastic brought me back up for another go. Then, an odd peace came over the whole experience. It felt so freeing to be down there, and the experience was mine alone. It wasn’t what I expected but it was a welcome feeling. So basically this is the tallest natural bungee in the world, I’ve done it, and now I can probably stop jumping off of bridges. Perhaps airplanes should be next! Stay tuned, I think I’ll go ahead and manifest that. Have you bungee jumped before? Would you do this one? Oh my God! It’s the one thing I don’t know if I can do. But if you’re gonna do it, you may as well jump off the tallest bloody jump, am I right?! My thoughts exactly! Skydived 5 times but never bungee jumped.  something about bungee jumping seems more dangerous (and yes I did solo jumps skydiving too!).  But after reading this, if I ever find myself at that facility…I just may try it!  Thanks for sharing! Jaime I’d love to do a solo skydive! I don’t know if I would have enough courage to do that. Part of me wants to, but the other part is so scared of heights. I admire you for that jump! You’re my hero 🙂 Aww thank you. Ah, awesome! I did the 138m bungee jump in Nevis in New Zealand and totally know how you feel! But kudos for jumping nearly 100m more than me! Must have been gorgeous I went bungee jumping in Nepal – the 2nd highest natural free fall in the world! – 2.5 years ago, and it was hands-down the most thrilling experience of my life. I understand completely that feeling of calm that comes over you once you’re off and away. Your jump looks amazing! It’s definitely something I would love to do again someday. Where in Nepal was it? Must’ve been beautiful This looks so scary! I’ve never done anything like this in my life so I can’t imagine the feeling. Loved the video! Wow it looks crazy, I hope you got the feeling you wanted out of it! I know what you mean by skydiving being easier, I’m just overcoming my fear of heights and have been contemplating skydiving but not bungee jumping (yet!) I kind of did, but I definitely think a canyon swing or skydiving would be even better! I bungee jumped in Queensland. Well, after ten minutes of standing on the edge, trembling and crying, while being coaxed to jump by the staff. Terrifying and rather embarrassing. Never again! You’re a lot braver than me! If I didn’t jump they just would have pushed me! I think paragliding is the most I’ll ever do. Haven’t done it yet though. Bungee jumping looks painful to me! Like the rope jerks you, and you could break your back or something. Does it hurt? I did paragliding  at Home which is India.. 🙂 It was quite an experience to do it at Bir Billing which is one of the world’s best sites for paragliding. It was very thrilling & flying in the clouds experience. Would love to bungee jump like you someday! Thanks for sharing. I would do it again maybe or train to do it myself. Tandem took too much control out and made it boring maybe because there was no risk. Kristin,you make bunjee jumping off the tallest bridge in the world look so easy! Haha if I thought about it too much I might  not have been able to do it! Mine sure did too. Tried skydiving last week and I like that a lot more. Maybe give that one a try! I did the Macau jump in 2008 but having the ability to have an unregulated free fall sounds amazing.  I can guess how you were feeling as the Macau jump was my first and only bungee jump in my life.  Enjoyed this post.  Cheers! I did a bridge swing at Vic falls a couple months later and liked that better! You get the bungee and then you get to swing and enjoy the scenery after.

https://www.bemytravelmuse.com/karoo-south-africa/,The Peaceful Perfection of The Karoo in South Africa,South Africa,"Have you ever felt truly alone? Not in the sense of lack of solidarity with your fellow man (or woman), but alone in the sense of pure, sweet freedom? Nothing around you, nothing encumbering you, what seems like the entire world at your feet as nothing obstructs your view in any direction, and not a soul around to destroy the beautiful moment unfolding before you? It’s a rarity, to be sure. That kind of infinite space and the beautiful feeling of being the only human on earth, even though deep down you know it’s not really true, creates the kind of euphoria that I haven’t often experienced. This overcame me as I stood at the center of the rock labyrinth on the Kingwill farm near Nieu Bethesda in the Karoo, South Africa. The clouds rapidly danced around the mountain peaks surrounding me, culminating in sweet desert rain right as I reached the end of the maze. It was the kind of coincidence I think they call, ‘fate’. Paula had told me that if I went into the labyrinth with a question, perhaps I’d come out with an answer. I was skeptical. I didn’t go in with anything in mind. I elected to try to make it meditative, but even that proved difficult. Eventually I just started looking around me and walking. It was so naturally beautiful, it quieted my mind. Around halfway through, odd emotions welled up in me that I didn’t expect. Suddenly I looked up at the mountain before me and felt like I had an answer, even though I hadn’t known the question: I just want to create something beautiful. I just want to help rather than harm. My purpose is to live simply and fully. I couldn’t believe she turned out to be right. The Karoo is known locally as the African bush, but I would call it a desert. The thing about deserts is, most people skip right over them thinking they couldn’t have much to offer. No trees? No beach? No little blended drinks with paper umbrellas!? How is that a vacation? That’s why it’s such a well-kept secret. That’s why you won’t see sunburnt tourists clouding your nature. It’s the best kind of vacation there is – complete desolation, if you can handle it. …and I think you can.  Paula and her husband, E, took her family farm over when it was on the brink of a sale when her folks advanced in age, beyond the ability to herd the cows (happy, free-roaming cows!) that make up the family business. Leaving a city life behind in Cape Town five years ago where she worked as a drama therapist, and her husband in film, they took on a monumental task: learning how to handle livestock with practically no agricultural education or background whatsoever. She had left the farm for schooling when she was young, and therefore did not grow up agriculturally inclined. What was it like at first? “Climbing up a vertical rock face with no safety harness,” says Paula. Who is one of few people in the world who can say she survived a black mamba snake bite, by the way. Basically, she’s badass. Ask her to tell you the story when you visit her. I was a bit hesitant when I arrived because I was there to experience the farmstay, but also to participate. I had received an email the day prior asking if I wanted to go cattle herding. On foot. You’re really asking a Los Angeleno to go cattle herding?! Well, okay then! We’re both in for a surprise I’d say! “Is it difficult?” I wondered aloud. “How’s your common sense?” Paula asked. “If you just use common sense it’ll be easier than you think.” I told her I’d like to think I have all sorts of common sense but if you simply look at all the scars on my legs you’ll see how clumsy I am. I think they say common sense isn’t all that common for a reason. Yet it turns out cattle herding is actually fun. We dropped down and snake-crawled under electric fences, jumped over streams and tiptoed around marshes, using sticks in either hand to appear as a moving fence. I was shocked the cows fell for it and each time one would look at me suspiciously, as I edged closer she’d go in the direction I wanted, just like that. My short stay on the farm could easily have turned into weeks. To really get away from it all and to disconnect actually helped me to reconnect with my purpose and reevaluate what is important to me. I had the time, space, and silence to think about it. That’s so important to do every now and then. Wouldn’t you agree? When you go to South Africa, even if you’re just passing through, will you see the Karoo? There are mountains, beaches, lions, and zebras to see in the rainbow nation, but a girl who has traveled the world has this to say – few things in life have affected me as profoundly as the Karoo did. I wish I could articulate the butterflies in my stomach, the overwhelming feeling of peace, the sudden lining up and organization of things in my mind that were previously running amok, and the peace of mind I emerged with better than I am right now. I guess all I can say is it’s the real deal. Do it yourself:  That sounds absolutely perfect. I love that feeling of emptiness, of complete desolation… I think it’s necessary every now and then to reconnect. Yes, definitely! You’ve just put South Africa higher up on my wish list. Yay! I’m sure yours is quite long like mine is! Based on all of your South African photos and stories, I want to go. Immediately. What a great story! Woooooooow you must have felt so connected to the earth here… Connection in the disconnection, so to speak. Exactly. I definitely did. Great place. Monday morning, and your post has made me wish I was far away from where I am now…ideally where the top shot was taken. Where are you now? Maybe that’s nice, too. It’s funny, I feel like I saw SO much of South Africa the first time I was there for three weeks, but it’s such a huge country, I barely scratched the surface (and no, I didn’t make it to Karoo). After two months I realize I’ve seen very little. Seems to be true of every country though. The longer I’m there, the more I’m aware of what I’m missing. The Little Karoo is perhaps even better with little towns like Barrydale and Ladismith (stop off at the hot springs at Warmwaterberg on the way) and then on to Oudtshoorn and the Cango Caves. The Swartberg Pass links the the Little Karoo and the Great Karoo and takes you to the very interesting town of Prince Alfred. There is “soul” in the Karoo and night skies to marvel at. Unbelievable countryside … South Africa’s rural areas are so awe-inspiring! Great read, found your blog while trying to figure out what I’ll need for my trek into the Karoo in September. Looking for to great road trip with an friend and colleague. We did one last year from Cape Town to Kruger National Park. Will post again on my return. Awesome! Let me know how it goes. I just loved the Karoo. So beautiful, orange and rugged. Cape Town to Kruger is a good run! I am from Canada and the first time i was in the Karoo was during a road trip three years ago. We ended up staying in Nieu Bethesda…and I was hooked! I returned the next year and rented a small home in Nieu Bethesda for seven weeks in June. Our Canadian summer, but South Africa’s winter. It was a complete escape for me and one that was greater than I imagined it would be. I made some wonderful friends while I was there….real down to earth Karoo people. I did not want to leave, but I needed to return to Canada to resume work. I would encourage anybody who is travelling to South Africa to spend some time in the Karoo…your life may not be the same after. Wow that’s amazing! I’ve toyed with the idea of staying there for an extended period of time. Seems like it would be so good for the soul. It’s cool to hear a firsthand account of doing just that. Hey Kristin, sounds like a great adventure! You’ve missed one of the best experiences, though – driving through the Swartberg Pass, as someone already mentioned 🙂  I visited only the Klein Karoo this year but I’m sure I’ll return to South Africa for more road trips! This country is just so perfect to travel 🙂 Cheeers,N.    Welcome to Be My Travel Muse, a travel community geared towards the adventurous, off the beaten path-loving traveler.
