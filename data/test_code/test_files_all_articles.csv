5,/united-arab-emirates-tourists-oman/,On the Road: Oman,United Arab Emirates,"OMAN – The road from Dubai to Oman passes through four other Emirates. There are no maps. There are only a few signposts along the way and we've been given scribbled directions that say things like: Continue forward 100 km and turn left at the tree. We begin on the wide highways beyond Dubai, leaving the glass and concrete towers of commerce behind. We pass through Sharjah, where the pre-mixed gin and tonics concealed in water bottles in the boot of our car (yes, we're English) become a vague source of concern when someone points out that people are stoned to death for minor infractions in this dry state. Some Emirates we pass through are completely unmemorable, except for obvious signs of a lack of prosperity compared to oil-rich neighbors. The last Emirate before the Omani border is Ras Al Khaimah, which is dominated by a large cement plant and a ceramics factory. The only sign of life is a skinny goat trying to find shade under a shrivelled, leafless tree. Lou, a lifelong family friend, lives in Dubai. Her parents and I are visiting for Christmas. There are two checkpoints at the Omani border, and the fees vary from person to person. It's a bit of a long-winded kerfuffle that leaves us feeling jaded. But the gloomy drive suddenly turns out onto a coastal road that winds around the Musandam Peninsula. The change is instant and breathtaking.The sudden landscape of mountainous rock plunging dramatically down into the sea looks like the result of a volcanic eruption. Because of these fjords, the Musandam Peninsula is known as the Norway of Arabia. There are barely any buildings — just the mountains, the sea, and a gleaming tarmac road that winds along and up, slicing cleanly through the rock on both sides. It's a marvel of engineering, even to someone who has absolutely no interest in engineering. The Musandam Peninsula, which is separated from the rest of Oman by the United Arab Emirates, is still relatively unvisited, except by divers looking to explore the pristine coral reefs. The new road has made it possible to go where few have ever been. Still, we don't see any cars in front or behind us, even in Khasab, the capital city. There is a fledgling tourism movement — most people end up at the Golden Tulip Hotel, one of three hotels in Khasab. There's also a petrol station, an airstrip (no international flights yet) a couple of restaurants, and a population of 18,000, though we count only four people. Besides driving, the other mode of transport is via dhow: a traditional wooden Arab sailing boat. These have been used for everything from pearl fishing to cargo, but now often carry people. A dhow cruise isn't anywhere near as touristy as it sounds, and I am thankful we are the only Westerners on our boat. We pass fjords and inlets while lying back on low patterned tapestry cushions, drinking hot sweet tea, and eating fruit and dates. Dolphins swim and play alongside us. From the water we can see remote coastal villages only accessible by boat. At Telegraph Island we strip down to our swimsuits and jump into the water. The rest of the women in our group politely queue for the boat's loo, so that they can change into modest head-to-toe bathing suits in a space the size of a picnic hamper. They all make it into the water eventually.We decide not to stay at the Golden Tulip, which is a bit dilapidated and lackluster — possibly due to the lack of competition — but still expensive (£14 for a gin and tonic at the bar). Instead, we take our smuggled booze to an apartment to drink in private. (Alcohol isn't banned in Oman, but driving with alcohol on board without a permit is not allowed in the UAE.) On a friend's recommendation we stay at Esra Hotel Apartments in Khasab, which is basic, but clean enough. (Khasab Travel and Tours also arranges dhow cruises.) Our apartment is rented to us by an Omani woman who is so elegant in her black abaya that we feel like apologizing to her every time we tromp past her in our Western swimsuits to get to the pool. We get a few funny looks from the neighbors — but these are of bemused interest, not hostility. The Omani people we meet are incredibly kind and hospitable, and they are keen to tell us about all the improvements being made to the infrastructure by the sultan: roads first, then hospitals, then schools. At dusk we watch the mountains turn shades of lilac I've never thought possible, and it feels that we are at the edge of the world.FIND IT →- Musandam Peninsula- Telegraph Island - Esra Hotel Apartments"
3,/what-to-do-layover-abu-dhabi/,How to Spend a Layover in Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,"Passing through the UAE on a layover with a few hours to spare? Travel writer Jaime Morrison Curtis makes a quick list of Abu Dhabi happenings so that you can make quick work of it when you find yourself in the Emirates' capital city.ABU DHABI – Like many major cities, Abu Dhabi acts as a hub for tens of thousands of travelers connecting east to west and north to south every year. One thing that makes the transfer port unique is the unusually long layover times most travelers will experience. Whether their final destination is an Asian city or a tiny island in the Indian Ocean, travelers are likely to find themselves with anywhere from a six- to 24-hour layover in Abu Dhabi. Consider it an opportunity to experience the UAE's stunning Arabian architecture and wonderful hospitality.Some travelers may opt to take a 90-minute luxury bus transfer to neighboring Dubai, but sticking around affords a deeper, more local glimpse into Emirati culture in the bustling yet more traditional capital city. Less hectic than its flashy neighbor, Abu Dhabi has enough Arabic experiences within twenty minutes of the airport to make a layover feel less like a hassle and more like another destination on your journey.Home base: Shangri La Abu Dhabi.A pool and private beach at Shangri La Abu Dhabi.Where to StayThough Abu Dhabi airport was the first to offer luxury sleeping pods (Go Sleep, Terminal 3), there are other options for really stretching out after a long flight.The U.A.E. is known for delivering the highest levels of hospitality to travelers, and that luxury is almost universally associated with brand names. A boutique hotel is a rare find in this part of the world, while chain brands flourish.Grand Canal is about ten minutes from the airport and has plenty to do nearby to get the most out of a short stay. For a luxurious taste of Arabic hospitality, book a room at Shangri La Abu Dhabi for private beaches, pools, spa, and spectacular views of the stunning Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center.Budget-friendly but still luxurious is the neighboring Trader's Hotel. Bright and contemporary, the hotel has a private beach along the gulf and access to all of the same luxuries from the Qaryat Al Beri complex as the Shangri La.Those with travel points saved up should use them to book a room at a similarly high-end spot like Ritz Carlton Abu Dhabi or the Hilton Capital Grand Abu Dhabi.Want more travel intel like this? Get our expert guide to becoming a better travel when you sign up for our weekly newsletter.What to DoVisit the MosqueA visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center is a must. While the view from the hotel room is stunning enough, the complex is worth seeing up close. The mosque is just across the water and is an architectural experience that is even more majestic at night, making it perfect for layovers. (Closing time is 10 p.m.) There are signs for self-guided walks and free, 45-minute guided tours in English or Arabic. Visitors have to wear modest Arabic dress or borrow a free abaya on-site to enter the mosque.Shop the SoukThere are six perfumeries and three shops selling beautiful abayas in Souk Qryat Alberi, which is accessible from Khor Al Maqtaa by traditional abra boat. After shopping, get traditional Arabic coffee (no visit to the United Arab Emirates would be complete without it) at the sophisticated Finyaal (Bain Al Jeserain, West Maqta; +2-444-5919), a favorite of locals and tourists alike.Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center.Better than any terminal window view.Fly the FalconsFalconry is an Emirati tradition dating back to antiquity. Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is six kilometers from the airport and offers a two-hour guided Falcon World Tour that covers the heritage and history of falconry in the UAE, giving visitors the option to see the majestic birds in flight and to hold them.Race Car Mania Emiratis are passionate about luxury cars — Formula 1 car racing, in particular. In November, Abu Dhabi hosts the Formula 1 Grand Prix and the city goes wild. For a taste of the passion year-round, visit Yas Marina Circuit on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from the airport, where you can watch the action on the track or drive a Formula 1 car for yourself.Also on Yas Island is the famous Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, a theme park which offers twenty thrill rides that you may or may not be in the mood for after your long flight.Hit the BeachJust twenty minutes from the airport is Saadiyat Island, a man-made island where you can enjoy the peaceful gulf waters at the Saadiyat Beach Club. Purchase a day pass to enjoy the seaside, saunas, and a beachside pool. In 2017, Saadiyat will unveil The Louvre AbuDhabi and Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. Amazing.Eat Your Way Around the WorldFill up on delicacies at the souq-style buffet at Sofra, which is truly the most luxurious selection of live cooking stations you are likely to experience. There's Emirati, Iranian, Moroccan, Indian, and Asian food (from unlimited lobster to fresh fusion sushi to hot curries) that gives you a peek into the spices, aromas, and flavors that define Middle Eastern cuisine. Sample the delectable preparations of local dates at the end of your meal.Sunrise views from Shangri La Abu Dhabi.Plan Your TripIf you're flying Etihad business or first class, you can book the free chauffeur service in advance of your flight. Otherwise, work with your hotel to pre-arrange (and pre-pay) a transfer from the airport, or grab a taxi at the always-bustling (even in the wee hours of the morning) taxi stand.The Grand Canal, mosque, and other destinations are an drive (10-20 minutes) from Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH), and one-way fares run about USD $12-$20. Taxis in the U.A.E. accept cash only (Arab Emirates Dirham), so make sure to check the current exchange rate and withdraw some at an airport ATM.

1,/cool-dubai-photo-story/,Dubai Is Way Cooler Than You Think,United Arab Emirates,"There's more to Dubai than all the glitz and glam you see on Instagram. The city is ripe with new openings, including vegan cafes, artisan chocolatiers, and hip concept shops. Travel writer Dylan Essertier spent five years exploring the best it had to offer.DUBAI – For those who think Dubai is nothing more than skyscrapers and fast cars, make no mistake, it is a cosmopolitan city with much to see, eat, and do. In fact, with so many new venues sprouting up overnight, it can be tempting to follow the pack and go where everyone else is going. Or, worse, skip the city altogether. Don't. That would be a dire mistake, especially when there’s an entire world of under-the-radar places waiting to be discovered. From wandering the bustling spice souk to traversing one of the emirate’s most luxe hotels, here are a few of my favorite spots in Dubai.Fuel up for a big week of exploring at Arabian Tea House, a must-visit in Dubai’s Al Bastakiya neighborhood. The special breakfast tray includes hummus, falafel, grilled halloumi cheese, olives, and jam and served with fresh vegetables and Arabic bread.Inside Arabian Tea House, which used to be an old pearl merchant's house, you will find white wicker chairs, turquoise benches, and historic photographs hanging on the walls.Start your trip to Dubai by stepping back in time and enjoying the atmosphere of Al Fahidi Historic District, one of the oldest traditional Emirati neighborhoods in Bur Dubai.Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU) offers a heritage tour that includes a walk through the area, a visit to a local mosque, and a Q&A session about Emirati culture, during which you’ll be treated to Arabic tea, coffee, and dates.Pro tip: To indicate that you are finished with your coffee, slightly shake the cup from side to side. As our tour guide Fatiyah explained to us, if you just give your cup back to the server, it means ""pour me more.""For those who think Dubai is nothing but expensive shopping malls, consider a traditional abra ride along the Dubai Creek from the Al Bastakiya neighborhood to the gold and spice souks. It will set you back a mere DHS 1 (that’s about 25 cents). This is a picture of the abra driver who shuttled us across the creek.Don’t leave the spice souk without picking up turmeric, paprika, and rarer spices like sunflower extract. You will also find one of the most expensive spices in the world: saffron. It’s the perfect gift to bring home for your favorite foodie.A close-up of embroidered slippers in the spice souk.Keep cool while you explore the souk with fresh coconut water.If contemporary Middle Eastern art and local food concepts are more your scene, visit Dubai’s up-and-coming Alserkal Avenue in Al Quoz. Wild & The Moon, a delicious vegan and gluten-free cafe, serves cold-pressed juices, smoothies, acai bowls, and more.While in Alserkal Avenue, visit Mirzam, a regional chocolate shop housed inside the brand’s manufacturing facility, where you can see every step of the chocolate-making process by peering into glass-walled pods. Don’t leave without sampling everything, including the white chocolate bars with rose (left), mango (middle), and roasted cashews (right).Beloved Dubai hangout Comptoir 102 is a healthy restaurant-slash-concept shop located inside a former beach bungalow.Isn’t it dreamy?

7,/empty-quarter-desert-uae/,A Grain of Sand in the Empty Quarter,United Arab Emirates,"Dubai-based Kaire Kalam traveled deep into the heart of Rub' al Khali, the world's largest desert. A reader story.RUB' AL KHALI, United Arab Emirates – I've failed. They lie there shaking their heads and yawning lazily despite my attempts to make them hike up a 200-meter sand dune. I'm left alone, face to face with the giant.I talked my American, Iraqi, Canadian, and Finnish friends into camping in the desert. Four hours south of Dubai lies the massive Rub' al Khali. It's the largest continuous sand desert in the world, covering 650,000 square kilometers. Empty Quarter, as it is also known, is mostly contained within Saudi Arabia but also reaches Oman, Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates. It's a home and playground to Bedouins and their camels. Within the UAE, it's an amazing opportunity for tourists to pitch their tents free of charge and experience a Bedouin lifestyle.Conventional wisdom says that travel to the Empty Quarter is no joke. It's dangerous, requiring serious preparation and at least three four-wheel drive vehicles. This is a standard desert off-roading practice, which ensures that if one car gets stuck in sand (which is pretty much inevitable), the second car can pull it free. If the second car gets stuck, the third can get everyone out safely.Or you can forgo the serious dune-bashing and take the asphalt roads and gravel tracks that wind through the desert. A single 4×4 vehicle can avoid plunging into the hazardous dunes when traveling alone. With short notice and only one 4×4, we decided to attempt our journey on asphalt and gravel. The five of us packed our tents, sleeping bags, flashlights, cell phones, firewood, and food, and hit the road.After a few hours of dull, flat, grayish sand, the desert started to show a new side. The sand turned a deep reddish-orange and roaming camels became a regular sighting. As we moved along the winding highway, dunes grew in size and changed in shape and form. We were getting a sense of this powerful wilderness. Sand floated over the man-made road in thin layers, a constant reminder of nature's perseverance.Sunset was fast approaching, so we took our chances with one of the nearby tracks off the main road. It steered us deeper into the desert. We let out air from the tires, switched to four-wheel drive, and continued looking for a place to pitch the tents. We passed a few ""sabkhas,"" white salt flats, a remnant of the ancient lakes that used to exist here. Rainfall causes them to soften, and they can become impassable by even a very capable 4×4.We soon came upon a monster of a dune hunkered down on one side of the road. Across from it was a flat area nestled inside a large three-sided bowl of soft, undulating red sand. The deal was sealed and a unanimous decision was made. We had found our perfect campsite.For as far as we could see in all directions, there was no sign of life. Only the giant dune loomed over us. We stared at it in awe and imagined what the views would be like from the top. We swore that in the morning we would climb it together.The sun woke us as it broke through the clouds and cool morning air. Before long I was restless to start the journey up the dune, which was quietly taunting me. My friends seemed to have forgotten their promise. I crossed the road alone.I sunk into the earth with each step. Grain by grain, sand crumbled over and covered my feet. Walking didn't work, so I dropped down to hands and knees and crawled forward. The sun got higher and hotter by the minute and I was soon out of breath. After 20 minutes of exhaustive scrambling, I reached the top.Golden dunes lay unbroken in every direction like waves across the ocean. The Bedouins refer to the Empty Quarter as the sea of deserts, and now I know why. High up on the shoulders of this monster dune, the silence was almost disturbing. I contemplated how powerful, hostile, and gorgeous the environment is, and how tough the Bedouins must be to survive it.I wondered how long I had until word got out, until we were charged entry fees into the spectacular desert. And I was equally pleased to be by myself. After some time, I took long leaps down to the camp — the sand came alive, making unexpected musical sounds and squeaks beneath my feet. Only a few short minutes and I was back at the bottom, leaving behind a long vertical trail that would soon be smoothed over by desert winds.Photo: Kaire KalamPLAN YOUR TRIPHow to Get ThereTake route E11 past Abu Dhabi, toward the town of Madinat Zayed. For a more scenic trip, drive towards Abu Dhabi airport, turning off onto Tarif Road at Junction 306 and heading toward Hameem. This way will take longer, but allows you to stop at the Emirates National Auto Museum. Both routes will head out to Liwa Oasis, a strip of villages bordering the Empty Quarter. From there, follow signs to Al Moreb Hill, a location used for competitive hill climbs.Y"
