31,/love-pan-am/,There Is Love After Pan Am,United Arab Emirates,"I owe my career in travel, which has been largely agreeable, with undeniable moments of high pleasure, to Pan Am.When I started Sobek, the adventure travel company, in the '70s, I had aspirations of worldwide exploration, of opening up arenas of adventure to a global audience. I had maps, charts, and globes, but little money. I had dreams of pioneering descents into the rivers of Turkey, Pakistan, New Guinea, Africa. Of hiking through India, Nepal, and the Andes. But as I made the rounds visiting various international airlines and asking for support, I was turned down again and again.When I met Rick Laylan, the district sales manager in San Francisco for Pan Am, he immediately caught my passion, shared my vision, and understood how adventure travel was poised to become a significant sector in the travel trade. He offered to help fly me to far-away places to explore and set up new tours. And it worked. His support on Pam Am flights ignited an entire industry.But I fell in love with Pan Am for other reasons. It was the Jackie O pillbox hats the hostesses self-importantly wore and the tunis blue uniforms. I loved that they loved flying. I felt courtly showing off my Pan Am bag, like an international man of mystery. I signed up on the waitlist for a Pan Am trip to the moon. I visited the ports in Macau and Foynes, Ireland, where the first Pan Am flying boats made their trans-oceanic stops. I even dated a Pan Am flight attendant (née stewardess). And I saw the world.For decades Pan Am was the world's largest international airline, my ticket to adventure. So, like so many, I was devastated when Pan Am went bankrupt in 1991. It was like a family loss. Rick Laylan moved to United, and I started working with a raft of international carriers. None provided the same enchantment and pride of the skies.There have been some wonderful experiences winging the world on various carriers: some have lovely staff, some offer impressive service, some even have tasty fare. But nothing compares to Pan Am — or at least how I remember it, and memory does tend to fetishize. Yet while getting there used to be half the fun, the typical long-haul flight is now characterized by a low hum of ordinariness, more efficiency than emotional richness.Until recently. I was on a flight to Africa on an airline I had yet to ride, and it reminded me of the good old days. This is, of course, a completely unscientific evaluation, and results may vary. But I'd like to share my assessment: My new Pam Am is Emirates.Here's why: I leave LAX late one Friday afternoon for a sixteen-hour flight to Dubai on a Boeing 777-300ER and immediately feel a difference. Attendants wear elegant high heels, hats (red pillboxes not dissimilar to Pan Am's), and beige scarves flowing sideways over one shoulder. Seats recline 180 degrees and sport winged headrests; plush eye covers are extra wide; there are noise-cancelling headphones, automatic window shades, even stars on the ceiling to lend some ambience. The seats give massages in four settings. A bottle of Voss water is an elbow away.Emirates spares little with its 17-inch-wide screen and ridiculous 1200 channels, not to mention a tablet you can control from the furthest reaches of the chair. Emirates was awarded the World's Best Airline In-Flight Entertainment for the seventh year in some industry poll, and I can't disagree. So, I watch a marathon of movies. The only thing missing is popcorn.Emirates started in 1985, as Pan Am was winding down, with two leased aircraft; it now has a fleet of 160 planes, and flies to some 116 destinations in 66 countries on six continents (including 21 cities in Africa). It links the world in a way Pan Am once did.Of course, many long-haul carriers feature flat beds, Michelin-style menus, and the latest wizardry in entertainment systems, so the real secret sauce to making a transcontinental flight transcendent is the staff and the authenticity of their attitudes. Too many cabin crew members seem to see the job as a chore these days, not as a privilege, the glamour bleached away. Most of the Asian-based airlines are rightfully legendary for their attention to detail and supreme service. But the staff  almost always seems a little too professional, almost impenetrable, more Stepford Wives than gregarious independents. On my Emirates flight, though, the staff is chatty, humorous, and personal. They are all stationed in Dubai and enjoy free luxury living accommodations, no taxes, and big discounts at bars, restaurants, and health clubs. But even then one shares that she misses Los Angeles, ""because you just can't get good BBQ ribs in Dubai.""Okay, using a hub means you have to connect. For most of my previous trips to Africa, I would connect through London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, or Paris and wait interminable hours in sterile lounges or duty-free shops. But Emirates is transforming layovers into indulgent stays. I arrive in Dubai at 7:45 p.m., with a connection to Johannesburg nine hours later. Yikes. But Emirates has arranged a chauffeur, and I am whisked off to One&Only Royal Mirage, a compound of caliphate-style palaces on a private beach on the Arabian Gulf. I'm spirited by electric cart past gardens and fountains to a junior suite complete with king-size bed (sprinkled with rose petals), a great high-pressure shower, and traditional majlis sofas (an Arabic term for a room in a private home used to entertain guests). My bane as a frequent traveler is that whenever I happen into an extravagantly romantic suite, I am alone.A heavenly few hours later, my driver shuttles me back to the all-Emirates Terminal 3 (larger than all of JFK), where I shuffle to the Emirates business lounge. It is, I must confess, an impressive sprawl, more high-end cruise ship than typical lounge. The length and width of two football fields, you almost need a GPS to navigate through the water features, plants, bars, and buffets. It has station after station of gourmet food of all ethnicities and stripes, with cooks at the ready, offering everything from tea and biscuits to a five-course meal with huge selections of wine and champagne. There are free massages, shoe shines, hot showers, wifi, and couchettes as good as most beds. I settle in with my laptop and a plate of tandoori chicken served with biryani, lachha salad, and mint chutney with a fine grand cru. I'm not ready to leave when the call comes to board.But the next surprise is the A380. Emirates has more of the Airbus super jumbos than anyone, 90 in fleet, and some 243 more on order. The plane consumes 20 percent less fuel per seat than other large aircraft, and the fuel economy is better than that of hybrid cars.The top floor of the plane is dedicated to first and business class. Unlike the 777, the seats are individual pods, personal sanctuaries with aisle access, and the beds are 79"" long and flat. This is better than Pan Am first class used to be.I head to the onboard lounge, a kind of luxury pub not dissimilar to what Pan Am provided in its original 747 configurations, but updated with a 42"" LCD screen, a couple of plush sofas, and a parade of genuinely affable staff. Unlike most other airlines, which tend to primarily hire from their originating country, Emirates has gone broadly international. It is a kind of United Nations of attendants, and I think this is one of the reasons the gladness factor is so high. (When hiring for disposition and bearing, the pool gets a lot bigger if you're not limited to a single geography.) Just on my flight to Johannesburg I meet crew from Korea, Argentina, Uzbekistan, Japan, Egypt, South Africa, Lebanon, the UK, Bulgaria, Serbia, New Zealand, and Moldova.But the real measure of the quality of an airline experience is whether you want it to end. It is only with regrets that we begin our descent into Johannesburg."

Guest rooms feature high-vaulted ceilings, king-size beds, and picture windows with built-in lounge seats; Julie Pearson (Spartan Shop) is behind the pared down decor. Surrounding the hotel, stunning views of the nearby woodlands, forest, river, and mountains abound.

Rooms are decorated with gingham fabric in rich hues of red, blue, green, and yellow (a palette of colors derived from 14th-18th century religious paintings); baroque-style wood furnishings; and simple white linens. The decommissioned red-brick Catholic church, designed by renowned New Orleans architect Henry Howard, will be used for events and gatherings.

The newest opening, a ten-hut lodge inspired by traditional Owambo architecture with a heated swimming pool, two spa rooms, a restaurant, and two bars, is set in the heart of a private animal reserve and has us daydreaming about a visit to Southwest Africa.

29,/united-arab-emirates-tourists-oman/,On the Road: Oman,United Arab Emirates,"OMAN – The road from Dubai to Oman passes through four other Emirates. There are no maps. There are only a few signposts along the way and we've been given scribbled directions that say things like: Continue forward 100 km and turn left at the tree. We begin on the wide highways beyond Dubai, leaving the glass and concrete towers of commerce behind. We pass through Sharjah, where the pre-mixed gin and tonics concealed in water bottles in the boot of our car (yes, we're English) become a vague source of concern when someone points out that people are stoned to death for minor infractions in this dry state. Some Emirates we pass through are completely unmemorable, except for obvious signs of a lack of prosperity compared to oil-rich neighbors. The last Emirate before the Omani border is Ras Al Khaimah, which is dominated by a large cement plant and a ceramics factory. The only sign of life is a skinny goat trying to find shade under a shrivelled, leafless tree. Lou, a lifelong family friend, lives in Dubai. Her parents and I are visiting for Christmas. There are two checkpoints at the Omani border, and the fees vary from person to person. It's a bit of a long-winded kerfuffle that leaves us feeling jaded. But the gloomy drive suddenly turns out onto a coastal road that winds around the Musandam Peninsula. The change is instant and breathtaking.The sudden landscape of mountainous rock plunging dramatically down into the sea looks like the result of a volcanic eruption. Because of these fjords, the Musandam Peninsula is known as the Norway of Arabia. There are barely any buildings — just the mountains, the sea, and a gleaming tarmac road that winds along and up, slicing cleanly through the rock on both sides. It's a marvel of engineering, even to someone who has absolutely no interest in engineering. The Musandam Peninsula, which is separated from the rest of Oman by the United Arab Emirates, is still relatively unvisited, except by divers looking to explore the pristine coral reefs. The new road has made it possible to go where few have ever been. Still, we don't see any cars in front or behind us, even in Khasab, the capital city. There is a fledgling tourism movement — most people end up at the Golden Tulip Hotel, one of three hotels in Khasab. There's also a petrol station, an airstrip (no international flights yet) a couple of restaurants, and a population of 18,000, though we count only four people. Besides driving, the other mode of transport is via dhow: a traditional wooden Arab sailing boat. These have been used for everything from pearl fishing to cargo, but now often carry people. A dhow cruise isn't anywhere near as touristy as it sounds, and I am thankful we are the only Westerners on our boat. We pass fjords and inlets while lying back on low patterned tapestry cushions, drinking hot sweet tea, and eating fruit and dates. Dolphins swim and play alongside us. From the water we can see remote coastal villages only accessible by boat. At Telegraph Island we strip down to our swimsuits and jump into the water. The rest of the women in our group politely queue for the boat's loo, so that they can change into modest head-to-toe bathing suits in a space the size of a picnic hamper. They all make it into the water eventually.We decide not to stay at the Golden Tulip, which is a bit dilapidated and lackluster — possibly due to the lack of competition — but still expensive (£14 for a gin and tonic at the bar). Instead, we take our smuggled booze to an apartment to drink in private. (Alcohol isn't banned in Oman, but driving with alcohol on board without a permit is not allowed in the UAE.) On a friend's recommendation we stay at Esra Hotel Apartments in Khasab, which is basic, but clean enough. (Khasab Travel and Tours also arranges dhow cruises.) Our apartment is rented to us by an Omani woman who is so elegant in her black abaya that we feel like apologizing to her every time we tromp past her in our Western swimsuits to get to the pool. We get a few funny looks from the neighbors — but these are of bemused interest, not hostility. The Omani people we meet are incredibly kind and hospitable, and they are keen to tell us about all the improvements being made to the infrastructure by the sultan: roads first, then hospitals, then schools. At dusk we watch the mountains turn shades of lilac I've never thought possible, and it feels that we are at the edge of the world.FIND IT →- Musandam Peninsula- Telegraph Island - Esra Hotel Apartments"
15,/fathom-questionnaire-kym-canter/,Meet the Traveler: Kym Canter,United Arab Emirates,"Hometown: Born and raised in New Haven, Connecticut, but consider NYC my hometown.Occupation: Creative director at L-atitude.com.Favorite destinations: Mumbai, Istanbul, Aswan, Havana.Dying to visit: I never met a souk or bazaar I didn't like, so I would like to do markets in Iran, Syria (I know, so sad), Burma, and Papua New Guinea (I recently saw some very good treasure form there).Bizarre travel rituals: Where to begin? Always arrive extra early to airport, always sit in row one, aisle seat, always start taking grapefruit seed extract (the elixir of all elixirs) a week before travel. I am an obsessively organized and an early packer. I bring a stocked medical kit and have often been called Florence Nightingale and Mary Poppins.In-flight relaxation regime: I am not a relaxed flyer. I alert the flight attendants to my issues, mainly that I need reassurance during turbulence because unstable air freaks me out. I also take Ambien on long flights. I eat before I board, but always arrange to have the dessert (usually the ice cream sundae) delivered to me before I fall asleep. I always have Star von Bunny, my plush rabbit book character, with me in the seat. If the seat next to me is empty, she gets her own.Kym and Star, nestled in row one.Always in carry-on: Ambien, grapefruit seed elixir, enough other drugs to open a CVS, and Star von Bunny.Concierge or DIY? Always concierge for special hook-ups and insights, then DIY.See it all or take it easy? See it all while taking it easy. Love to have crazy busy days and relax in five-star comforts with room service and weird TV at night. For me, the hotel is as important as the destination.Drive or be driven? Be driven. I don't even have a driver's license.Travel hero: My journalist friend Ann Marlowe, who has done 18 trips to Afghanistan embedded with the United States Army, as well as Benghazi and Yemen. In another life, I want to be a war reporter and not a shopping travel princess.Star Von Bunny in Egypt.Star von Bunny in Barcelona with her friend, fashion editor Lynn Yaeger.Star Von Bunny is always living it up somewhere, from the Dead Sea to Peninsula Hotel beds.Weirdest thing seen on travels: In 1999, the man in line ahead of me at the airport in Beijing could not understand why he could not bring his gun on the plane. Sitting in the lobby of the Oberoi in Mumbai recently, not realizing I was sitting next to the Emir of Qatar until 15 men walked up and kissed his hand and backed away. Seeing a dead body being carried to be cremated in Varanasi, India. Flying home two weeks ago when a man on the plane got smashed on his duty free booze and hit a flight attendant.Best hotel amenity: The pillow and sheets at any Peninsula Hotel. The bed is like a cloud, and, if you stay there enough, they will monogram your initials on the pillowcases.I dream about my meal when its room service breakfast in France. Real eggs, real butter, fresh baked croissants, and great strong coffee. It's heaven.Everywhere I go, I check out the drugstore. When I first started traveling, I used to buy all my beauty products, like Nivea cream, in foreign countries so the packaging was in foreign languages, especially Arabic. I thought this made me seem sophisticated and exotic.When I arrive in a new place, I learn the lay of the land by calling a friend of a friend — I have them in every city — and inviting them for drinks and convincing them to become my personal fixer.I always bring home textiles and fabric to make pillows and recover furniture that never seems to happen. Jewelry, tunics, caftans, slippers if applicable, antique objects that could probably be referred to as junk. Random photographs, beauty products. I am always shopping for holiday gifts, regardless of whether it is July or December. I am a sucker for baby lambs and goats and always want to adopt.I travel for the life experience, local culture, and the shopping."
37,/holiday-barr-al-jissah-resort-muscat-oman/,Just Back From: Muscat,United Arab Emirates,"Just back from: Muscat, Oman.Was it your first time? It was my first visit and likely my last, though I would like to explore Musandam Peninsula.How long were you there? Seven days.Why did you go? I was looking for a warm holiday from London for my family that didn't require 12+ hours on the plane (Asia), that was affordable (which ruled out much of the Caribbean), and that would be culturally inspiring for the children.Who were you with? My family: husband and two kids, 10 and 11.What was the best tip you got before you left? The best tip was to visit a Wadi. This came from several people: my son's teacher, who is English but had lived and worked in Oman for twenty years, another family who had recently visited Oman, and an editor at a new and thriving travel website called Fathom. Sadly, I know it was the best tip because everyone at the hotel told us how great it was. But we never made it!What's the #1 tip you'd give a friend who wanted to go? Airfare is cheap, so splurge on the hotel. You'll be spending a lot of time there.What did you do? Seven days on a lounge chair at Shangri La's Barr Al Jissah Resort. Not that there is anything wrong with that! I made use of the kayaks (the resort has great water sports), the gym, the tennis courts. But once I found the perfect chaise with views of the sea and the rocky coastline, I felt no need to move. Well, the view and Michael Lewis's Moneyball.Were you there for the right amount of time? Had it been a bit warmer, I would have been happy to stay a few more days. Otherwise, seven days was ample. This was especially great: The people. Omani natives and those who now call it home are some of the most open, happy, and helpful people I have met in my travels. But this wasn't: The souk. Incredibly disappointing. It could have been a kiosk on Canal Street in New York City (no offense to those masters of trade). There were no treasures to be found and bargained for, no local color. In the end, it felt like a very sad, florescent-lit garage.Speed Round of Favorites1. Meal: Big feast dinner, Omani-style: spiced stews, grilled meats, aubergines, fresh seafood. Not a goose or turkey in sight!2. Neighborhood: The beach that was adjacent to my room. 3. Site: The Mosque at night. Beautifully lit, immense, and generally awe-inspiring.4. Kodak moment: Full moon and rocky coastline — aggressively lit by the hotel designers.One thing/place you didn't get to visit, but wanted to: A wadi.What did you bring back? A tan and a very sore forearm and bicep from a hellish 15 minutes on a Banana Boat.Would you go back? I would go back to Oman but a different hotel and a different region — my entire visit I was fantasizing about the Six Senses Zighy Bay on the Musandam Peninsula! I would not bother visiting Muscat again.Any surprises? My disappointment was a big surprise.You can't stop thinking about: Why I didn't simply go back to Dubai or Miami.PLAN YOUR TRIPGet ThereFly: Seeb International Airport (MCT) in Muscat has direct flights from Europe (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan) and throughout the Middle East and Asia.Visas: American, Canadian, British, European, and Australian residents need a visa, which can obtained at the Omani embassay (for around $10) or at airport upon arrival (for around $50).Find ItShangri La's Barr Al Jissah ResortPO Box 644, Postcode 100 Muscat, Sultanate of Oman+968-2477-6666Read More on Fathom- A Mosque Grows in Muscat - On the Road: Oman"
25,/what-to-do-layover-abu-dhabi/,How to Spend a Layover in Abu Dhabi,United Arab Emirates,"Passing through the UAE on a layover with a few hours to spare? Travel writer Jaime Morrison Curtis makes a quick list of Abu Dhabi happenings so that you can make quick work of it when you find yourself in the Emirates' capital city.ABU DHABI – Like many major cities, Abu Dhabi acts as a hub for tens of thousands of travelers connecting east to west and north to south every year. One thing that makes the transfer port unique is the unusually long layover times most travelers will experience. Whether their final destination is an Asian city or a tiny island in the Indian Ocean, travelers are likely to find themselves with anywhere from a six- to 24-hour layover in Abu Dhabi. Consider it an opportunity to experience the UAE's stunning Arabian architecture and wonderful hospitality.Some travelers may opt to take a 90-minute luxury bus transfer to neighboring Dubai, but sticking around affords a deeper, more local glimpse into Emirati culture in the bustling yet more traditional capital city. Less hectic than its flashy neighbor, Abu Dhabi has enough Arabic experiences within twenty minutes of the airport to make a layover feel less like a hassle and more like another destination on your journey.Home base: Shangri La Abu Dhabi.A pool and private beach at Shangri La Abu Dhabi.Where to StayThough Abu Dhabi airport was the first to offer luxury sleeping pods (Go Sleep, Terminal 3), there are other options for really stretching out after a long flight.The U.A.E. is known for delivering the highest levels of hospitality to travelers, and that luxury is almost universally associated with brand names. A boutique hotel is a rare find in this part of the world, while chain brands flourish.Grand Canal is about ten minutes from the airport and has plenty to do nearby to get the most out of a short stay. For a luxurious taste of Arabic hospitality, book a room at Shangri La Abu Dhabi for private beaches, pools, spa, and spectacular views of the stunning Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center.Budget-friendly but still luxurious is the neighboring Trader's Hotel. Bright and contemporary, the hotel has a private beach along the gulf and access to all of the same luxuries from the Qaryat Al Beri complex as the Shangri La.Those with travel points saved up should use them to book a room at a similarly high-end spot like Ritz Carlton Abu Dhabi or the Hilton Capital Grand Abu Dhabi.Want more travel intel like this? Get our expert guide to becoming a better travel when you sign up for our weekly newsletter.What to DoVisit the MosqueA visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center is a must. While the view from the hotel room is stunning enough, the complex is worth seeing up close. The mosque is just across the water and is an architectural experience that is even more majestic at night, making it perfect for layovers. (Closing time is 10 p.m.) There are signs for self-guided walks and free, 45-minute guided tours in English or Arabic. Visitors have to wear modest Arabic dress or borrow a free abaya on-site to enter the mosque.Shop the SoukThere are six perfumeries and three shops selling beautiful abayas in Souk Qryat Alberi, which is accessible from Khor Al Maqtaa by traditional abra boat. After shopping, get traditional Arabic coffee (no visit to the United Arab Emirates would be complete without it) at the sophisticated Finyaal (Bain Al Jeserain, West Maqta; +2-444-5919), a favorite of locals and tourists alike.Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Center.Better than any terminal window view.Fly the FalconsFalconry is an Emirati tradition dating back to antiquity. Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital is six kilometers from the airport and offers a two-hour guided Falcon World Tour that covers the heritage and history of falconry in the UAE, giving visitors the option to see the majestic birds in flight and to hold them.Race Car Mania Emiratis are passionate about luxury cars — Formula 1 car racing, in particular. In November, Abu Dhabi hosts the Formula 1 Grand Prix and the city goes wild. For a taste of the passion year-round, visit Yas Marina Circuit on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from the airport, where you can watch the action on the track or drive a Formula 1 car for yourself.Also on Yas Island is the famous Ferrari World Abu Dhabi, a theme park which offers twenty thrill rides that you may or may not be in the mood for after your long flight.Hit the BeachJust twenty minutes from the airport is Saadiyat Island, a man-made island where you can enjoy the peaceful gulf waters at the Saadiyat Beach Club. Purchase a day pass to enjoy the seaside, saunas, and a beachside pool. In 2017, Saadiyat will unveil The Louvre AbuDhabi and Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. Amazing.Eat Your Way Around the WorldFill up on delicacies at the souq-style buffet at Sofra, which is truly the most luxurious selection of live cooking stations you are likely to experience. There's Emirati, Iranian, Moroccan, Indian, and Asian food (from unlimited lobster to fresh fusion sushi to hot curries) that gives you a peek into the spices, aromas, and flavors that define Middle Eastern cuisine. Sample the delectable preparations of local dates at the end of your meal.Sunrise views from Shangri La Abu Dhabi.Plan Your TripIf you're flying Etihad business or first class, you can book the free chauffeur service in advance of your flight. Otherwise, work with your hotel to pre-arrange (and pre-pay) a transfer from the airport, or grab a taxi at the always-bustling (even in the wee hours of the morning) taxi stand.The Grand Canal, mosque, and other destinations are an drive (10-20 minutes) from Abu Dhabi International Airport (AUH), and one-way fares run about USD $12-$20. Taxis in the U.A.E. accept cash only (Arab Emirates Dirham), so make sure to check the current exchange rate and withdraw some at an airport ATM. Note that almost everyone you meet will speak English and be more than happy to help you on your journey.Keep Exploring the UAEHospitals and Harps in the DesertDubai Is Way Cooler Than You Think"
21,/best-hotel-openings-2018/,Here They Come: The 20 Best Hotel Openings of 2018,United Arab Emirates,"We’re calling it now: 2018 is going to be an especially great year for hotel openings. From historic renovations to off-the-grid glamping sites in some of the world’s most spectacular settings, travelers will be treated to incredible design, thoughtful collaborations, and memorable experiences. These are the twenty we're most excited about, in order of (anticipated) opening, followed by a list of the near-100 others that we have our eye on around the world. (We weren't kidding that this is a banner year for hotels.)Photo courtesy of SoHo House.Kettner’s TownhouseWhere: London, EnglandWhen: JanuaryWhy we’re excited: The latest project from Soho House comes with a colorful history: Originally established in 1867 by August Kettner, who opened London's first French restaurant and fed the likes of King Edward VII, Winston Churchill, Bing Crosby, and Margaret Thatcher (and, rumor has it, Napoleon III) and managed to stay open through both World Wars. This month, the restaurant and champagne bar will reopen its doors with 33 Art Nouveau-style bedrooms and a historic Jacobean suite in Soho.Check in: Book a RoomPhoto courtesy of Sydell Group.The Nomad Los AngelesWhere: Los Angeles, CaliforniaWhen: JanuaryWhy we’re excited: After the success of its New York City flagship, the Sydell Group’s second Nomad hotel will open in Downtown LA’s historic twelve-story Giannini building.

Kerry Hill Architects then painstakingly restored the 50 disassembled homes to create the accommodations: 26 Antique Villas along with 24 newly constructed Ming Courtyard Suites. Also on site: a modern-day recreation of a 17th-century Chinese scholar's studio, where guests can spend time learning, contemplating, and practicing traditional crafts like calligraphy, music, and painting; six traditional tea ceremony rooms; and an impressive spa combining ancient healing practices from traditional Chinese medicine with 21st-century well-being and technology.Check in: Book a RoomPhoto courtesy of Sydell Group.Line DCWhere: Washington, D.C.When: JanuaryWhy we’re excited: After a lengthy waiting period, the first spinoff of LA’s hip Koreatown hotel is finally open for business.

The drinking and dining options include The Cup We All Race 4, a modern-day lobby cafe serving Counter Culture Coffee and delicious, straightforward food from chef Spike Gjerde and Corey Polyoka (of Baltimore's Woodberry Kitchen) and chef Erik Bruner-Yang of of D.C.'s Maketto.

Activities will run the gamut from tame (panning for gold, buffalo safari jeep tour) to adventurous (horseback riding and rock climbing).Photo courtesy of Six Senses.Six Senses BhutanWhere: Paro, Thimphu, Punakha, Gangtey, and BumthangWhen: AugustWhy we’re excited: With three lodges slated to open this summer (the other two will follow later in the year), the tiny Himalayan nation will soon be home to not one but five of Asia’s most anticipated openings.

35,/cool-dubai-photo-story/,Dubai Is Way Cooler Than You Think,United Arab Emirates,"There's more to Dubai than all the glitz and glam you see on Instagram. The city is ripe with new openings, including vegan cafes, artisan chocolatiers, and hip concept shops. Travel writer Dylan Essertier spent five years exploring the best it had to offer.DUBAI – For those who think Dubai is nothing more than skyscrapers and fast cars, make no mistake, it is a cosmopolitan city with much to see, eat, and do. In fact, with so many new venues sprouting up overnight, it can be tempting to follow the pack and go where everyone else is going. Or, worse, skip the city altogether. Don't. That would be a dire mistake, especially when there’s an entire world of under-the-radar places waiting to be discovered. From wandering the bustling spice souk to traversing one of the emirate’s most luxe hotels, here are a few of my favorite spots in Dubai.Fuel up for a big week of exploring at Arabian Tea House, a must-visit in Dubai’s Al Bastakiya neighborhood. The special breakfast tray includes hummus, falafel, grilled halloumi cheese, olives, and jam and served with fresh vegetables and Arabic bread.Inside Arabian Tea House, which used to be an old pearl merchant's house, you will find white wicker chairs, turquoise benches, and historic photographs hanging on the walls.Start your trip to Dubai by stepping back in time and enjoying the atmosphere of Al Fahidi Historic District, one of the oldest traditional Emirati neighborhoods in Bur Dubai.Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding (SMCCU) offers a heritage tour that includes a walk through the area, a visit to a local mosque, and a Q&A session about Emirati culture, during which you’ll be treated to Arabic tea, coffee, and dates.Pro tip: To indicate that you are finished with your coffee, slightly shake the cup from side to side. As our tour guide Fatiyah explained to us, if you just give your cup back to the server, it means ""pour me more.""For those who think Dubai is nothing but expensive shopping malls, consider a traditional abra ride along the Dubai Creek from the Al Bastakiya neighborhood to the gold and spice souks. It will set you back a mere DHS 1 (that’s about 25 cents). This is a picture of the abra driver who shuttled us across the creek.Don’t leave the spice souk without picking up turmeric, paprika, and rarer spices like sunflower extract.

In its heyday, the thirteen-room motel welcomed the likes of James Dean and Bob Dylan. Come March, guests and visitors can expect more than a fresh coat of paint. The new owners want to create a meeting place where locals and visitors can partake in a health and wellness program designed by Brooklyn's Jill Lindsey (who will bring a small pop-up of her eponymous Fort Greene, Brooklyn, shop) and a yet-to-be-determined experiential element created by Habitas.

9,/ask-fathom-can-i-go-middle-east/,Can I Go to the Middle East?,United Arab Emirates,"Dear Fathom: With the region in turmoil, can I go to the Middle East?Yes and no. Or more specifically, there are some places you probably shouldn't visit right now, some places you cannot visit, and others that are probably more enjoyable now than at most other times.I've spent the past ten years living between the United States (my home town, New York, and Washington, DC) and the Middle East (Cairo, Jerusalem, Beirut). I've covered the region for the Weekly Standard, Tablet, the New York Times, as well as a number of Middle Eastern publications, and I wrote a book about the Middle East, The Strong Horse: Power, Politics, and the Clash of Arab Civilizations. The phrase typically used to describe the series of uprisings throughout the Arabic-speaking Middle East the last few months, the Arab Spring, is somewhat misleading. First of all, the political upheavals have not hit every country in the region, and those countries that have been touched were all affected differently. One Lebanese friend just back from a business trip to Tunisia told me the country was so calm that you'd never know anything had happened there, even though this is where the Arab Spring started in January. So Tunisia is okay. But Libya is out, unless you're a war junkie.Elsewhere in North Africa, Morocco is seeing some demonstrations right now, even though that's a fairly common occurrence: King Mohammed VI, who came to the throne in 1999, allows more political freedoms than many of his peers around the region. More worrying is a recent terror attack at a café in Marrakesh, a city that is one of the country's major destinations. The violence was specifically targeting tourism — unfortunately, a fairly common tactic throughout the Middle East, especially in Egypt, used by Islamic extremists seeking to undermine the ruling regime's economy. I hate to warn against traveling to this beautiful, warm and welcoming country, especially now with the main tourism season upon us, but it is advisable to wait at least a few months to see if there will be subsequent attacks or if the authorities have the situation in hand.Let's swing all the way to the easternmost reaches of the region in the Persian Gulf before coming back to the Levant.Saudi Arabia is safe, but there's little reason to visit, unless you're Muslim and planning on taking part in the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj.Dubai, the most famous of the seven United Arab Emirates, is also secure, but there's a reason the pearl of the UAE tends to attract more European than American visitors: Americans don't need to fly fourteen hours to find luxury shopping, beaches, and five-star restaurants. That's what Los Angeles and Miami are for in the winter, and New York in summer, which, incidentally, has many times more Russian women than Dubai.Oman is a U.S.-friendly Persian Gulf state with beautiful beaches and is relatively safe, even though it, too, is starting to see protests gathering steam. Paradoxically, the least tourism-friendly country in the Persian Gulf right now is the one that most encourages it, Bahrain. This small Gulf emirate is home port of the U.S. Fifth Fleet and an important American ally. Nonetheless, the disposition of its ruling royal family, the Khalifa, is anything but American. The Khalifa, a Sunni Muslim regime, has ruthlessly repressed a Shia majority population that has been demanding its political rights now for close to a century. While Bahrain's security forces seem to have quelled the unrest, for the time being anyway, the situation is potentially explosive. Moreover, there's no compelling reason to put more money at the disposal of a government that treats more than half of its citizens like slaves.That brings us to the Levant, the middle of the Middle East, where there are several no-gos, including Syria, where demonstrations across the country are turning increasingly violent. Americans need visas before they reach the Damascus airport or the country's borders, and the chances of obtaining one now are slimmer than usual. And given the violence of the government's security forces, it's not worth the effort of trying to secure one.Iraq, after years of violence, is settling down some, but still iffy as far as tourism. Unless you're a student of archeology or medieval Islam, there is little in the way of tourism sites. Iraqi Kurdistan is both safe and beautiful with rolling hills and lakes, but summer is not an ideal time to visit this very pro-U.S. region.Jordan has seen some protests with (relatively) low levels of violence, but most of that has taken place in the capital, Amman. And no one who visits the Hashemite Kingdom visits because of Amman. Rather, there's the southern triangle, comprising Petra, the ancient red-rose Nabataean city carved out of stone; Wadi Rum, the astonishing desert vista that King Abdullah II says is the soul of Jordan; and Aqaba, the Red Sea seaside resort. There's also the Dead Sea, with fantastic hotels lining this world-famous, unique body of water.Across the Dead Sea is Israel, not strictly speaking part of the Arabic-speaking Middle East, even though Arabs constitute 20 percent of the Jewish state's population. In spite of a recent terror attack in Jerusalem, Israel is safe, especially outside major population centers like the capital and Tel Aviv. When the weather turns warm, there's either the beach, with fantastic seafood restaurants all along the Mediterranean coast from Tel Aviv up to Haifa, or northern Israel, the Galilee. The northern mountains of Israel, in cities like Tzfat, is where Israelis used to go for relief in the summertime, long before the advent of air conditioning. Even now, Israelis from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv make their way up north for weekend getaways, filling Galilee hotels and bed and breakfasts on the Golan Heights, where you'll find some of the region's most amazing views (you can see Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon) and the world's best beefsteaks. Golani cattle and the region's blossoming wine industry make this area a small Levantine Argentina.North of the Galilee is Lebanon, usually one of the Middle East's most volatile countries, but for the time being anyway, it's one of the safest. And yet even when it is most tense, Beirut still stays open all night partying. For food, fun, and people-watching, this is the top city in the region, far and away. The summer can be a difficult time to visit with so much of the Lebanese diaspora coming back to spend time with their family, and this looks to be one of the country's biggest seasons for tourism ever. That is because the Lebanese understand that much of the violence that comes to Lebanon is sent there by the Syrian regime, as a way to exercise its hegemony over its smaller, wealthier neighbor. And yet the conflict in Syria is consuming all of its neighbor's attention, meaning that Lebanon can breathe freely right now. Of course, that could all change at a moment's notice. The Lebanese know how live the two sides of their reality, but it's a little harder on tourists. As ever in Beirut, when you go you take your chances. Few visitors think it's not worth the risk.And then there's Egypt. During the uprising there that brought down President Hosni Mubarak in February, the turmoil and violence set back the tourism industry significantly. Tourism is one of the economy's largest sources of revenue, and right now travel to Egypt is down significantly, which may turn out to be good news. The country is safe, if relatively vacant, which means that there are bargains to be had. Typically crowded venues throughout Cairo, Alexandria, and along the Nile (like Luxor and Aswan) are begging for business. The only downside is that the salesmen, vendors, and tourist guides at all the major sites who are typically aggressive under normal circumstances are going to be even more eager to move their wares now. Still, if you have patience for it, that's not a bad deal to see the Pyramids and the Sphinx without the crowds.Do you have a burning (or a simmering) travel question you can't solve?

3,/empty-quarter-desert-uae/,A Grain of Sand in the Empty Quarter,United Arab Emirates,"Dubai-based Kaire Kalam traveled deep into the heart of Rub' al Khali, the world's largest desert. A reader story.RUB' AL KHALI, United Arab Emirates – I've failed. They lie there shaking their heads and yawning lazily despite my attempts to make them hike up a 200-meter sand dune. I'm left alone, face to face with the giant.I talked my American, Iraqi, Canadian, and Finnish friends into camping in the desert. Four hours south of Dubai lies the massive Rub' al Khali. It's the largest continuous sand desert in the world, covering 650,000 square kilometers. Empty Quarter, as it is also known, is mostly contained within Saudi Arabia but also reaches Oman, Yemen, and the United Arab Emirates. It's a home and playground to Bedouins and their camels. Within the UAE, it's an amazing opportunity for tourists to pitch their tents free of charge and experience a Bedouin lifestyle.Conventional wisdom says that travel to the Empty Quarter is no joke. It's dangerous, requiring serious preparation and at least three four-wheel drive vehicles. This is a standard desert off-roading practice, which ensures that if one car gets stuck in sand (which is pretty much inevitable), the second car can pull it free. If the second car gets stuck, the third can get everyone out safely.Or you can forgo the serious dune-bashing and take the asphalt roads and gravel tracks that wind through the desert. A single 4×4 vehicle can avoid plunging into the hazardous dunes when traveling alone. With short notice and only one 4×4, we decided to attempt our journey on asphalt and gravel. The five of us packed our tents, sleeping bags, flashlights, cell phones, firewood, and food, and hit the road.After a few hours of dull, flat, grayish sand, the desert started to show a new side. The sand turned a deep reddish-orange and roaming camels became a regular sighting. As we moved along the winding highway, dunes grew in size and changed in shape and form. We were getting a sense of this powerful wilderness. Sand floated over the man-made road in thin layers, a constant reminder of nature's perseverance.Sunset was fast approaching, so we took our chances with one of the nearby tracks off the main road. It steered us deeper into the desert. We let out air from the tires, switched to four-wheel drive, and continued looking for a place to pitch the tents. We passed a few ""sabkhas,"" white salt flats, a remnant of the ancient lakes that used to exist here. Rainfall causes them to soften, and they can become impassable by even a very capable 4×4.We soon came upon a monster of a dune hunkered down on one side of the road. Across from it was a flat area nestled inside a large three-sided bowl of soft, undulating red sand. The deal was sealed and a unanimous decision was made. We had found our perfect campsite.For as far as we could see in all directions, there was no sign of life. Only the giant dune loomed over us. We stared at it in awe and imagined what the views would be like from the top. We swore that in the morning we would climb it together.The sun woke us as it broke through the clouds and cool morning air. Before long I was restless to start the journey up the dune, which was quietly taunting me. My friends seemed to have forgotten their promise. I crossed the road alone.I sunk into the earth with each step. Grain by grain, sand crumbled over and covered my feet. Walking didn't work, so I dropped down to hands and knees and crawled forward. The sun got higher and hotter by the minute and I was soon out of breath. After 20 minutes of exhaustive scrambling, I reached the top.Golden dunes lay unbroken in every direction like waves across the ocean. The Bedouins refer to the Empty Quarter as the sea of deserts, and now I know why. High up on the shoulders of this monster dune, the silence was almost disturbing. I contemplated how powerful, hostile, and gorgeous the environment is, and how tough the Bedouins must be to survive it.I wondered how long I had until word got out, until we were charged entry fees into the spectacular desert. And I was equally pleased to be by myself. After some time, I took long leaps down to the camp — the sand came alive, making unexpected musical sounds and squeaks beneath my feet. Only a few short minutes and I was back at the bottom, leaving behind a long vertical trail that would soon be smoothed over by desert winds.Photo: Kaire KalamPLAN YOUR TRIPHow to Get ThereTake route E11 past Abu Dhabi, toward the town of Madinat Zayed. For a more scenic trip, drive towards Abu Dhabi airport, turning off onto Tarif Road at Junction 306 and heading toward Hameem. This way will take longer, but allows you to stop at the Emirates National Auto Museum. Both routes will head out to Liwa Oasis, a strip of villages bordering the Empty Quarter. From there, follow signs to Al Moreb Hill, a location used for competitive hill climbs.Y"
