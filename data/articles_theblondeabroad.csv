And in most of Austria, the scenery is exactly that. Along with rolling hills, the country is filled with medieval architecture, modern museums, and posh bars and restaurants.In order to get the most of your trip to Austria, it’s important to find out the best time to visit depending on your trip and what you’re looking to do during your stay. The weather is extremely seasonal!Here are the best times to travel to Austria!  Mayerhofen, AustriaApril to MayApril to May are the ideal months to visit Austria.The chilly winter months are warming up and transitioning into summer days. However, temps can still be a bit unpredictable. Hiking enthusiasts will still find that it gets a bit cold and the lake temperatures are quite chilly. Because of this weather, fewer crowds visit meaning lower prices and more accommodation options.This is a wonderful time to explore Hofburg, an area that is the embodiment of Austrian culture. The base of the city dates back to 1233 AD so you can only begin to imagine the culture that lies within its gates. Spring is also a great time to visit Vienna, a city that is usually bustling with people.   June to AugustWhen summer rolls around it’s all about the festivals—and it’s also peak season for tourism!In June there is the Midsummer Night Celebration, an event held all over the country, with bonfires and folkloric events. In Salzburg in July, there are festivities galore for the Salzburg Festival—a festival of music and drama that dates back to 1920.Aside from the festivals, this is a great time to visit if you’re an outdoors enthusiast. For unforgettable views, visit Zell am See, a city that features a sapphire-colored lake surrounded by glaciers. If you’re a hiker, take a trip to Hohe Tauern National Park where you can go trekking under the summer sun.September to OctoberFall in Austria something out of a movie. The trees that sit on the rolling hills become painted in red and gold hues as the temperatures begin to drop. Peak season comes to an end during the fall so a visit during September or October means fewer tourists and lower prices.Plus you still get incredible weather (we’re talking highs anywhere between 57-71 degrees).September is one of the best times to experience Austria’s wine culture, one of the finest among Europe. In fact, Vienna has a magnificent vineyard culture and you can taste local wines paired with traditional Austrian cuisine.October is home to an abundance of events in Vienna including Viennale, the film festival, Vienna Fashion Week, and “Long Night of Museums,” an evening where museums extend their operating hours.  Vienna, AustriaNovember to MarchWhile winter usually signifies low season in many other European countries, Austria’s winter months are quite unique. Crowds are definitely lower than they once were in the summer, yet many still come to experience the snowfall and Christmas markets that Austria has to offer.Oh, the Christmas markets!! If you haven’t been before, this is reason enough to visit!If skiing in the Alps isn’t on your bucket list, add it now. And winter in Austria is the perfect time to mark it off. The sleepy village of St. Anton has become the skiing capital of the country. Its resorts’ roots date back to 1901 yet there are still modern touches that one could want on a winter getaway.Read More:Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaVisiting the Christmas Markets in Salzburg Have you been to Austria before?

Throughout Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and beyond, you will find the greatest Christmas markets in the world.Filled with twinkling lights and the heady aroma of holiday spices, these places are truly magical. And there’s no better way to experience the holiday season than on a river cruise.When I found out that Crystal Cruises does a Danube Christmas Markets cruise, I started packing. I have traveled through the Seychelles Islands as well as taken a Brazilian Holiday cruise (my first ever cruise) with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with cruises ever since.Cruising from Vienna, Austria, into Passau, Germany; Krems, Austria; and Bratislava, Slovakia, I saw some of the most breathtaking architecture I’ve ever seen in my life. And the markets! If you like to shop until you drop and explore foodie wonderlands, welcome to heaven.I fell head over heels in love with Austria on my European Christmas market tour. We started off at the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Vienna.With baroque architecture, this lavish former imperial residence would take your breath away at any time of year, and it is in its prime at Christmas.Next up, with chestnuts literally roasting on an open fire, Vienna’s most popular Christmas market, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz, delivers serious classic yuletide cheer at its 150+ stalls.In Austria, we also took a tour of the Salzburg Christmas Markets and the traditional markets of the Austrian Lake District. It was love at first sight with the little village of St. Gilgen. It was straight out of a storybook. With snow-capped mountains and icy lakes, the entire region is picture-perfect.Tagged the “most romantic market” in the region, the Christmas market in Passau, Germany, was my favorite. With its own unique flair, this place was everything I expected of a Christmas market and more.Of course, you can’t talk about Christmas without mentioning the food. So, for you foodies out there, head to the Bratislava Christmas Market. This Slovakia market delivers yummy dishes on an unprecedented scale.Ready to get in the holiday spirit? It’s time to start planning your own trip to visit the Christmas Markets in Europe."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-the-christmas-markets-in-vienna/,Visiting the Christmas Markets in Vienna,Austria,"Home to Mozart, Beethoven, and Sigmund Freud, Vienna is one of the world’s great cultural capitals. With imperial palaces and an endless baroque streetscape, this city has a romantic appeal like nowhere else.Gorgeous at any time of year, the Austrian capital is in its prime at Christmas. With snow falling on the streets of Vienna and lights twinkling overhead, it’s hard not to fall in love with the city.On my exploration through the heart of central Europe, I had the chance to check out this winter wonderland. Here’s my experience visiting the Christmas markets in Vienna.Top Things to See in ViennaThere is so much to see and experience in Vienna. You don’t want to just jump ahead to the markets and move on. There are some essential sights you can’t miss.Clock Museum: Called the Uhrenmuseum in German, this quirky collection of clocks dates back to the 1400s.Schönbrunn Palace: With an eternal place at the heart of Austrian culture, this baroque palace is Vienna’s number one attraction and was my top spot in the city. I took a tour of the palace and then explored the market after sunset. There were tons of cute vendors and lots of yummy food!Sunset From The Top Of St. Stephen’s Cathedral: Head to Stephansdom right before sunset for a breathtaking view of Vienna. You can take an evening tour that’ll take you to the top, or you can go it solo. Check out the catacombs beneath the church too for a totally different view.State Opera House: Called the Wiener Staatsoper, this is one of the most beautiful buildings in all of Europe. Get glammed up for a taste of the royal life. While it is a five-star experience, you can actually buy tickets for only a few euros.Hofburg Palace: This thirteenth-century palace houses three museums. It is the former imperial home and has all of its original decor. It’s home to the Austrian National Library, the largest library in Austria, but you’ll never notice the books. This place is a floor-to-ceiling work of art.Plan on extra time for the plaza outside the door, Heldenplatz, too!Michaelerplatz: Just outside of Hofburg, you’ll find excavated Roman ruins that’ll give you a glimpse into the older side of Viennese culture.Café Central: A former hangout of Freud and Trotsky, this is one of the oldest coffee shops in the world. It’s also the best place to experience classical Viennese cuisine.Balthasar Coffee Shop: Vienna is famous for its coffee culture, and Balthasar Kaffee Bar is one of my top stops. Try the Wiener Melange, an ultra frothy sort of cappuccino; Café Maria Theresia, flavored with a boozy orange liqueur; or the tall, dark, and handsome Einspänner.Burgtheater: Opened in the eighteenth century, this is one of the most important German-language theatres in the world. It’s a pretty place to explore and the perfect venue to take in a show.St. Stephen’s Cathedral: The symbol of Vienna, this twelfth-century gothic cathedral is a must-see. Consider looking into its official tours.Graben: Vienna’s most famous street, this is the ideal spot for a long stroll—be sure to bring your camera. Walk your way over to Kohlmarkt for some incredible shopping.Schwedenplatz: Located on the river, this picturesque spot is one of the top areas for nightlife and it’s packed with great restaurants.Best Christmas Markets in ViennaOn my European River Cruise onboard Crystals Cruise, I explored the greatest Christmas markets of central Europe, and the ones in Vienna were some of my faves!Wiener Christkindlmarkt am Rathausplatz: This is the most famous in Austria, and it had the most wow factor. It’s also the biggest market and the most touristic, so it can get a bit crazy, but I still highly recommend it.Spittelberg: An easy walk from the Christkindlmarkt am Rathausplatz, this market spans several streets through the extraordinarily quaint neighborhood of Spittelberg.Christkindlmarkt am Karlsplatz: This stunning market is right in the heart of Vienna, and it’s one of the city’s most iconic landmarks.Christmas Village at Belvedere Palace: We took a private museum tour through this striking spot and stuck around for a concert in front of the imperial palace. Loved it!Spittelberg Weihnachtsmarkt: Spittelberg Quarter is famous for its bohemian vibe, and while it’s not massive, it has a few cute and unique stalls that make it worth checking out."
https://theblondeabroad.com/danube-christmas-market-river-cruise-with-crystal-cruises/,Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises,Austria,"What better place is there in the world to spend Christmas than in Central Europe? Exploring the Christmas markets of Austria, Germany and Slovakia has always been a dream of mine, and it makes for an idyllic destination to enjoy a white Christmas.Ready to have your breath taken away by the snow-capped mountains and quaint destinations dotting the Danube River? Crystal River Cruises will get you there.My boyfriend, Meyer, and I spent ten days on the stunning Crystal Mozart and were blown away by the world-class hospitality and service. PLUS, cruising through the European Christmas Markets was a bucket list experience in itself.Here’s what to expect from the Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises.Day One: Vienna, AustriaWe were able to board the Crystal Mozart around noon on day one! Upon arrival, we got settled onto the ship, explored a bit, and then jumped on the complimentary shuttle into town to explore Vienna.We opted for an early night so we could get ready for our upcoming whirlwind adventure!Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Two: Vienna, AustriaWe spent the first morning out exploring the city. The Imperial Schönbrunn Palace and Christmas Market were the highlights of the day.The market outside the palace was one of my favorites! It was a picture-perfect introduction to Christmas markets and ended up being one of my favorite spots that we visited during the entire journey.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Three: Melk, AustriaOur morning started on a cruise through the Wachau Valley and we arrived late morning in Melk. This was such a charming region. As we went through the valley, I tuned my listening device in, provided by the cruise, to hear about all of the sights we were passing by.This region is famous for its Baroque architecture. We explored the Melk Abbey, and it was truly remarkable. The library was incredible, though, sadly, there was a strict “no photos” policy, but we did get some great shots from outside.Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Schönbühel Castle!Day Four: Salzburg, AustriaOur scheduled itinerary in Linz offered a full-day trip to Salzburg. We took the full-day trip around Salzburg’s Christmas Markets.We opted out of the tour of Hellbrunn Palace, but we heard it was beautiful and I would recommend checking it out. After returning to the ship, you’ll be docked within walking distance to the Linz Christmas Market.It’s right on the river, so it’s easy to get to and in its prime in the evening.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in SalzburgDay Five: Austria’s Lake DistrictThe next morning we took another full-day trip to explore the “traditional Christmas” scene of St. Gilgen and St. Wolfgang in Austria’s Lake District. This was one of my favorite adventures on the cruise.St. Gilgen is straight out of a storybook, and you get lots of time to explore the lovely St. Wolfgang. Both towns have incredible markets and great photo ops on the lake with views of snow-capped mountains in the background.Day Six: Passau, GermanyWe had such a hard time deciding what to do on this day! Our excursion options for this day were a Munich full-day tour, a Passau walking tour, a snow show hike, or both of the latter two. We decided not to do Munich — everyone said it was awesome, but it was a four-hour drive back from Munich to the ship.Ultimately, my boyfriend did the Passau Walking Tour & Christmas Market, while I stayed behind on the ship. It ended up pouring the entire day, and it made for a challenging day to be out and about.We had planned to do the Bavarian Snowshoe Hike when he got back, but assumed that we didn’t have enough warm clothes, so we ended up skipping it.This was yet another regret! We heard from other guests that it was absolutely fabulous.If you decide to skip Munich and do the snowshoeing, know that the company provides boots that go over your shoes, though packing snow boots are a great idea if you can squeeze them into your bag.Day Seven: Regensburg, GermanyThe day trip to Regensburg was definitely my favorite day. It is such a stunning town, and we got the whole day to explore on our own. We saw the main old town, then met back up with a guide to visit the “most romantic Christmas market”.Located at the doorstep of a German princess’s house, this market completely exceeded my expectations. We enjoyed lots of roasted chestnuts, gingerbread and mulled wine (famously known as glühwein in Germany).Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in Regensburg, GermanyDay Eight: Krems, AustriaKrem is known as the pearl of Wachau Valley and rightfully so. It’s rich in history and beautiful sights.We arrived on a Sunday, which means that pretty much everything in Central Europe is closed. Krems is a really sleepy town, and I’d suggest a solo tour rather than going for the Krems Highlights & Christmas Market excursion.Day Nine: Bratislava, SlovakiaAfter so many walking tours, it was nice to have a morning on board to just chill and soak in the five-star experience. We arrived to Bratislava at noon.We took the Panoramic Bratislava & Christmas Market tour and really loved the old town of Bratislava. It’s home to remarkable architecture.Not to mention, the Christmas market had TONS of food — much more than other markets we’d seen in Austria and Germany.Day Ten: Vienna, AustriaWe returned to Vienna and spent the whole day on our own walking to iconic spots like the Cafe Central and the most popular Christmas Market in Vienna, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz.Our cruise ended with a special Michelin dinner which was included in all 2017 bookings (double check your 2018 bookings to confirm yours)!Honestly, we already felt like we had been digging into Michelin quality meals the entire time, but it was a great experience to gather all the other guests together at one massive table to chat and share travel stories.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Eleven: DepartureWe packed up all of our Christmas gifts and market souvenirs, and disembarked the Crystal Mozart late morning.Crystal River Cruises had another complimentary shuttle back to the airport, so we could haul our souvenirs without any hassle. An absolute life-saver when traveling!Instead of heading straight home, we decided to extend our trip and head over to explore the city of Budapest! Staying at the incredible The Ritz-Carlton, Budapest, this city quickly became one of my all-time favorite European destinations.All photos edited with TBA Presets!Thanks to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my stay. As always, thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/river-cruise-onboard-crystal-cruises-mozart/,River Cruise Onboard Crystal Cruises’ Mozart,Austria,"There is no better way to take in Central Europe’s greatest sights than from a river cruise. Winding through picturesque Austrian cities of Vienna, Melk, Linz and Krems onto Passau, Germany and into Bratislava, Slovakia, the Festive Christmas Market Cruise on the Danube River was a dream with Crystal River Cruises. The cruise takes you through the best of the best on the Danube.I took my first ever cruise with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with them ever since. They wowed me on a 15-day Brazilian cruise over Christmas and New Year’s Eve, and I hopped on the Crystal Cruises’ Esprit Yacht for an amazing adventure around the Seychelles Islands.Ready to get your sea legs? Here’s an inside look at my experience onboard Crystal Cruises’ Mozart.The ShipWe set sail on the 154-passenger Crystal Mozart riverboat. The ship was a floating resort with everything that you need for a luxe escape.The Crystal Mozart has a state-of-the-art fitness center (with an outdoor stretch, yoga and Pilates space) a spa, café, ice cream bar, swimming pool, and everything else your heart would want from a top-of-the-line hotel.Everything on the ship is all-inclusive, which promises a truly stress-free experience. It started with complimentary airport transfers from the airport to the river yacht.The ship also has nice perks like twice-daily room cleaning and free clothes pressing. There’s a 24-hour self-service pantry where you can grab a midnight snack and drinks, or you can just go for the 24-hour room service.And, the service really is incredible. I chatted with so many guests onboard who mentioned that they’d been on three or more cruises other than Crystal River Cruises, and they all said that they kept coming back because of the incredible hospitalityThe RoomWe stayed in the Penthouse with the French balcony, and it was très chic. The room boasts a king-sized bed (which can be converted into two twin beds), a vanity, good-sized closet, 40” HDTV, Nespresso coffee machine, and a two-seat sofa.The Crystal Mozart has a few different options to choose from. There is a suite with a fixed window, penthouse with a French balcony, 1-bedroom Crystal penthouse with a French balcony, and two-bedroom Crystal suites (connecting rooms) with a French balcony.They’re all gorgeous digs, so it comes down to your group size and budget.The FoodOn arrival, we had all our meals and drinks included — and I’m talking about five-star indulgences, including premium beverages like champagne. For breakfast, it was a lavish buffet or a la carte.The Festive Christmas Market Cruise onboard Crystal Mozart is all about Michelin-starred culinary experiences. The food is farm-to-table and features an array of fresh, locally sourced ingredients from the port city. It is the perfect chance to check out the best of the best in the world of Central European cuisine.There are multiple dining venues around the ship including the main restaurant, outdoor seating, a European style Bistro, Waterside Market, the Pantry, the Palm Court and the Piano Bar.My favorite part? The all-you-can-eat gelato bar!Activities and EntertainmentFrom the minute we boarded the Crystal Mozart we were surrounded by Christmas. It got us in the holiday spirit and had an array of activities to represent each country on the itinerary.There was everything from local dancers to guest speakers to get us in the festive mood.Of course, sometimes there was just nothing better than just sitting back and looking out to admire the scenic Wachau Valley and Danube River.Overall, compared to sailing by yacht or with Crystal at Sea, this tour had the most activities and time off the ship. I had so many unforgettable experiences exploring the cities and towns of Austria, Germany, and Slovakia.For me, Central Europe is a dream Christmas destination. From the Christmas markets filled with mulled wine to the roasted chestnuts, the entire region is a winter wonderland and Crystal River Cruises made it easy to see it all.[/tbabox]More InformationCruise Ship: Crystal MozartLocation: Danube River, Northern EuropeCost: $$$-$$$$Thanks to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-the-christmas-markets-in-salzburg/,Visiting the Christmas Markets in Salzburg,Austria,"On the edge of the Alps, under a great clifftop fortress, you’ll find one of Europe’s most picturesque cities. One of Austria’s largest cities, Salzburg is a dream holiday destination.Famous for its baroque architecture, it has one of the best-preserved city centers you will find north of the Alps. While it’s a worthwhile destination all year long, Salzburg really comes into its prime over the holidays.As you gaze over the snow-covered roofs and listen to the church bells chiming, it begins to feel a lot like Christmas.Ready to get into the holiday spirit? Here’s everything you need to know about visiting the Christmas Markets in Salzburg.Getting to SalzburgSalzburg lies in northwestern Austria near the border of Germany. It’s less than a two-hour train ride from Munich and just under three hours away by rail from Vienna.While traveling by rail is an easy and affordable way to see central Europe, I took the more scenic route. I indulged in the ultimate Christmas escape and traveled on the Festive Christmas Market Cruise on the Danube River onboard Crystal River Cruises to check out all the continent’s greatest Christmas markets.I started in Vienna and traveled down the Danube; Salzburg was day three on my European sojourn.Exploring SalzburgThe first thing you’ll notice in Salzburg is Hohensalzburg Fortress. Overlooking the entire city, this is the largest fully preserved castle in central Europe. It is also the top spot to go for a panoramic view.As you’re looking down on this quaint little city, you’ll see incredible buildings everywhere that are ripe for exploration. Among the most impressive spots are Mirabell Palace and Hellbrunn Palace.To get your cultural fix and learn more about the history of all the gorgeous spots you’ve been snapping shots of, head over to DomQuartier.Grab a ticket to this expansive baroque complex, and you’ll be able to get into five different Salzburg museums.Of course, you can’t leave without seeing the Hagenauer Haus, the home where Mozart spend his childhood 250 years ago. He is one of Salzburg’s greatest local heroes, and the city is ultra proud of its wunderkind. You can find some one-of-a-kind classic artifacts in Hagenauer Haus.Salzburg Christmas MarketOne of the world’s oldest Advent markets, the Salzburg Christmas Market dates back to the fifteenth century. With around 100 traditional stands where Christmas treats and handicrafts are sold, this market is the perfect spot for a stroll.Sip on some steaming Glühwein (mulled wine) and nibble on some Kletzenbrot, Austrian fruit bread, while you soak it all in.Once you have your shopping fix, check out some of the other activities at the Salzburg Christmas Market. Join the sing-along choir every Tuesday, and belt out your fave Christmas tunes. If you’re there on a Thursday or Saturday, listen to the beautiful traditional wind music performance. On Saturdays, you’ll see the Christ Child and angels perform.Ready to start planning your adventure to the Salzburg Christmas Market? It runs from the end of November until the day after Christmas every year."

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-working-holiday-visas-in-australia/,The Ultimate Guide to Working Holiday Visas in Australia,Australia,"Australia was one of my first big international trips and it’ll always hold a special place in my heart. In fact, it was the birthplace of this very site! During my first visit, I was on a typical tourist visa.This common tourist visa is officially called Subclass 601 and it allows you to visit Australia up to three months at a time in a given year.It’s a pretty handy visa because you can enter the country as many times as you’d like during the course of a year. So theoretically, you could explore some of Australia, make friends and head to Bali with them, and then go back to Australia…I may know from personal experience. 😉It’s also pretty darn cheap! You’ll pay 20 AUD (about 14 USD) to apply online and because it’s all processed electronically, most of the time you can get it within 24 hours. If you’re just planning on traveling around Australia for 90 days or less, this is what you’ll need!However, if Australia steals your heart (like it did mine!), you need to do a bit more planning if you want to stay for a longer period of time. This leads us to Working Holiday visas!Many people who want to explore Oz in depth, work somewhere else for a change of scenery, or do a gap year opt for a Working Holiday visa down under! Don’t know where to start? No worries, mate!Here is your guide to Working Holiday visas in Australia!    What is a Working Holiday Visa?The name pretty much sums it up: it’s a balance between work and play! The idea of a Working Holiday visa is to allow you to split your time between working and exploring.It’s ideal for those who want to stay in Australia for more than 90 days at a time, take a gap year, and make a little money while traveling. Oh, and for those that are thinking about maybe wanting to make Australia a permanent home one day—it’s a good way to plant roots, find possible employment options, and see if it would be a viable option.Where should you travel with a Work and Holiday visa? I’m glad you asked! The options are endless—you might find you absolutely adore Byron Bay or Sydney and settle there, or perhaps you like the vibe of Melbourne. You could even road trip or take the train and visit Uluru and Alice Springs (here’s an epic itinerary for the Outback!). Of course, you’d have to make your way up to the Great Barrier Reef.Like I said above, the Work and Holiday (or Working Holiday visa) is made so you can holiday! 10 Tips for Your First Trip to AustraliaFrom the otherworldly landscapes to the animals to the scuba diving spots…and don’t even get me started on the food—Australia definitely deserves a spot on your bucket list. Ready for an adventure of a lifetime down under? Read More   Working Holiday 417 VisaThe best visa for you will depend on where you are from.If you are from Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, or the United Kingdom, you can get a Subclass 417 visa (otherwise known as the Working Holiday visa).If you are from one of these countries and are between the ages of 18 to 30 (or 18 to 35 if you’re Canadian, French or Irish), the 417 visa is a prime choice. It is intended for those who want to extend their stay and fund it by working locally.This visa costs $440 AUD and you can apply online. While you can work while you are in Australia, you do need to have enough funds to support yourself…just in case. It’s a requirement to have at least $5,000 AUD saved.Why is this necessary? The Australian government wants to make sure you have enough money to book a ticket back home in case you don’t end up finding a job or spend all your money on…Tim Tam biscuits (totally kidding!) But I am serious about having the proof of funds in your bank account.   Bondi Icebergs, SydneyWork and Holiday 462 VisaSimilar to the 417 visa, there is a Subclass 462 visa (also known as the Work and Holiday visa), for those 18 to 30 years old who are not from one of the countries listed above. These visas are both, according to the Australian government, meant as “a temporary visa for young people who want to holiday and work in Australia for up to a year.”To be eligible for a 462 visa, you must be from Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Peru, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, USA, Uruguay, or Vietnam.USA readers—this is most likely the visa you’ll want!This 462 visa costs $485 AUD (337 USD). While the 417 visa tends to be instant, the 462 visa can take up to two months to get approved, so make sure to allow for plenty of time before booking your ticket.You will need to have at least $5,000 AUD ($3,479 USD) in your bank account and meet some additional requirements.There are set educational requirements, English skills, and (unless you are from Israel, China, Singapore, or the USA) you will need to get a letter of support from your national government. Read more on the requirements here! The Application ProcessWhether you are doing a 462 or 417 Visa,I’d suggest only going through the Australian government website. There are companies who will sell a visa service, but in my opinion, it’s a waste of time and money.The application process to get one of these visas is super simple as long as you follow instructions and provide the proper paperwork. Yes, you might need to collect a few documents which can be tedious, but the actual application couldn’t be easier!   Sydney Opera HouseThe Fine PrintOnce you have received your visa (electronically! It’s typically not one you have to print and doesn’t require a sticker in your passport—so don’t fret!), you have 365 days for your Aussie experience. If you received your visa on the first of February, you have until the first of February the following year to come and go.During this year, you will have the opportunity to work up to six months with one employer. There are a few industry and location restrictions, so read up on the official visa website before you get all of your plans in place.Beyond the work restrictions, it is pretty straightforward. You can study up to four months and re-enter Oz as many times as you want while your visa is valid!    How To Get a JobYour best bet for work is in customer service. Hotels/hostels, retail stores, cafes, and restaurants are generally open to six-month terms, especially if you have some experience.While some places won’t hire backpackers (they want to make sure their staff is there to stay for longer than a week or two), there are many places that will hire travelers. Given a bit of luck and the drive to find work, you’ll be able to find places to fund your trip along the way.You might even find a new career path…who knows? 😉Some folks find jobs at wineries or doing “regional work” in the field—picking fruits or helping around the farm. Many people on Working Holiday visas opt for this as it allows for a bit more flexibility and freedom.While you typically can’t stay employed at a place for more than six months, you can apply to extend your working permission. Generally speaking though, you will want to start by planning for just the first six months and then explore options.   Tips for Finding a RentalSo, this definitely depends on how long you’re planning on staying in any one location. If you’re only at each place for a few weeks, you might want to opt for staying in hostels or booking an Airbnb.But if you’re staying longer, there are a ton of legit rental companies all over Australia! However, it can often be difficult to score a place if you’re not signing a year-long lease.Gumtree is Australia’s answer to Craigslist…but it can be a slow and messy way to find a place. You definitely need to research if looking to rent one of these places as a number of scams can pop up. But you can *sometimes* find rentals this way, just take precautions.That said, agency listings are the prime place to find a home to call your own. Agency listings are typically cheaper than long-term Airbnb options but are more reliable than what you’ll find on Gumtree. Another option—check to see if there are any housing boards or ads at local coffee shops!As you are searching, keep in mind that prices are always listed by the week rather than the month! So it’s not nearly as cheap as it seems. Make Sure to Get Travel InsuranceI’ve said it once and I’ll say it again: travel insurance saves the day! If you had asked me during my first Aussie trip, I would have said it’s a waste of money. But I’ve lived and I’ve learned, and here’s why you need travel insurance.You never know what’s going to happen, especially while you’re abroad…you might get bitten by a Jack Jumper ant or your flight might get canceled due to crazy weather in Sydney.Note: Health insurance is required by the Australian government in order to get the visa—check if your insurance in your home country will work or if you need to go through the Australian system. Getting a Second Work and Holiday VisaWant to stay in Australia even longer? I don’t blame you!For those that are wondering, you can’t *exactly* extend your visa but you can apply for a second Work and Holiday visa if you meet the specified requirements. Which is pretty much the same thing!For those on a 462 visa and the 417 visa, you have to have completed 3 months of specified work on your first Work and Holiday visa and then you can apply for a second one. And as of July 2019, if you really want to stay longer—you can explore options to stay for the third year!Helpful Tip:What happens if your visa is almost up but you’re hoping to get a second one? You can obtain a bridging visa so you don’t have to go home for the interim period, read up more about this here!Make sure that if you apply in Australia, you’re in Australia when the government decides on your application; if you apply outside Australia, you must be outside Australia when the decision is made. OverallGetting a Working Holiday visa is a great way to travel around Australia—with it, you can balance your time between working and exploring and seeing so much of what Oz has to offer!Are you considering getting a Working Holiday visa or have you done this in the past?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-australia/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Australia,Australia,"Australia is the birthplace of The Blonde Abroad and it’ll always hold a special place in my heart (I came up with the concept of this very blog while sitting at a cafe near Sydney Harbour!).When I first left the corporate world in search of something else, my first stop was Australia. I spent nearly two months living on the East coast of Oz and I couldn’t get enough! The country has a beauty and diversity unlike anywhere else—there’s the cool coastal city of Sydney, the street-art-saturated hub of Melbourne, and all the gorgeous environments in between.From the otherworldly landscapes to the animals to the scuba diving spots…and don’t even get me started on the food—Australia definitely deserves a spot on your bucket list. Ready for an adventure of a lifetime down under?Here are my top tips for your first trip to Australia!  Bondi Beach, SydneyTake Sunscreen SeriouslyDid you know Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world?The sun is much stronger in Australia and it needs to be properly respected. This means regularly applying sunscreen, wearing sunglasses, and protective clothing, as well as a hat during midday. You will even see little kids running around daycare slathered in sunblock and donning (the cutest) bucket hats.Take your skincare seriously! Why You Should be Traveling with Reef-Safe SunscreenWhile wearing sunscreen is extremely important to protect your skin, did you know that it can cause damage to our planet’s reefs? Read MoreSeasons are ReversedIf you are coming from the Northern Hemisphere, be sure to keep in mind that the seasons are reversed. In Australia, like the rest of southern Africa and most of South America, Christmas actually falls at the hottest time of the year.It can be a bit confusing when you read tips from locals because they will refer to the months of December through February as summer. Keep this in mind when you’re planning for the weather as well!Plugs are DifferentThe plugs in Australia are type I (230V/ 50HZ)...which are the same as those in China. I would highly recommend buying a universal adapter with surge protection. Getting a one-in-one saves a lot of trouble. It just works everywhere for everything so you don’t have to worry about bringing the right adapter.Helpful Tip:It’s essential to be aware of the difference between adapters and converters. If you’re using a hair dryer or any other styling tools, be sure to use a converter. Getting 220V into a 100V American heat styler can destroy it.Stay SafeI am not talking about pickpockets!In Australia, it is the critters with more than two legs you have got to watch out for! Australia is actually one of the safest places in the world, but there are a lot of poisonous spiders…and snakes, and jellyfish.If you’re out bushwalking (what Aussies call hiking), make sure to keep an eye out for Jack Jumpers (venomous ants)!   Melbourne is a MustWhen you open a map and lay your eye over the incredible expanse of Australia, the sheer size of it is overwhelming. As an Aussie newbie, the options seemed endless and it’s not easy to know where to go.After exploring the better part of the country, I fell head over heels for Melbourne.A dream for foodies and street art lovers, Melbourne is a dynamic city. Join a walking tour for your first day then explore solo! It may feel a bit counterintuitive but wandering down a dark alley at night is actually the best way to find the swankiest spots in Melbourne.Read More:15 Free Things to Do in MelbourneThe Best Places to Eat in Melbourne  Sea Cliff Bridge, New South WalesRent a CarYou do have to drive on the other side of the road, but it’s SO worth it! A lot of rental agencies will offer both manual and automatic cars, so you don’t have to worry too much if you don’t know how to drive a stick. Australia is a massive country and a vehicle is a necessity if you want to see it all.If you have time, rent a van and plan a road trip.Explore the Great Ocean Road, the Gold Coast, the Great Barrier Reef, then venture to the Outback. Be sure to make time for the wine country of Adelaide then end with a city break in Sydney. While it was Melbourne that really stole my heart, the coast of Sydney had that certain San Diego charm I adore.It is best to drive during the day.Try to avoid driving at night—especially at dusk and dawn—as this is when crepuscular animals come out foraging for food. Roadkill is a HUGE issue in Australia and accounts for the loss of so many critters. Your trip will be more relaxed if you can stick to driving during the day.Read More:The Best Day Trips from SydneyItinerary for Australia’s Great Big OutbackNo Need to TipJust say thanks!Did you know the minimum wage is $18.93 AUD per hour (about $13 USD)? Unlike the US where servers depend on tips, Aussie workers make a standard hourly wage and don’t expect tips.Explore Tasmania  If you have time to go even further afield, get over to Tasmania. The charming town of Hobart is a hidden treasure and sometimes you can even catch a glimpse of the Southern Lights (Aurora Australis)! This Smithsonian guide to the Southern Lights is full of great info!Helpful Tip:If you’re visiting on a Saturday, make sure to check out Salamanca Market—one of Australia’s largest and most vibrant outdoor markets. Purchase a SIM CardGetting a SIM card will make your time in Australia much easier. The cards are cheap (you can often find them for around $2) and you can get a simple data plan for a low cost.Generally speaking, Optus or Amaysim are good options for urban coverage. If you are going to be traveling away from the metro areas, Telstra offers wider coverage at a slightly higher price. Stay LeftJust like Aussie driving, when you’re walking down under, stay to the left. It keeps the flow of foot traffic moving smoothly and stops those awkward sidewalk dances. OverallAustralia is such an incredible location full of diverse landscapes and is a great place to experience, especially if it’s your first solo trip. Have a fantastic time, mate!Oh, and make sure to stock up on Tim Tams while you’re there—they’re Aussie’s answer to the Oreo. You’ll thank me later!Helpful Tip:Ready to become Aussie? If you’re renting a longer-term apartment, it’s essential to be aware that prices are always listed by the week rather than by month. So, when you see the prices, don’t think you’re getting the deal of a lifetime."
https://theblondeabroad.com/a-guide-to-litchfield-national-park/,A Guide to Litchfield National Park,Australia,"Litchfield National Park is one of the top attractions in the Top End. It’s home to stunning waterfalls, crystal clear pools and sandstone pillars at the Lost City.While its a popular day trip from Darwin, I recommend staying overnight at the campgrounds. You can explore the many trails in the park and take your time exploring the park’s beautiful natural wonders.Here is my guide to Litchfield National Park!Getting to Litchfield National ParkLitchfield National Park is located two hours south of Darwin, Australia and is easily accessible by car. The main route is along the sealed Stuart Highway via Batchelor, but before you go, you’ll want to check the road conditions.Many of the 4WD tracks close during the wet season (November to March). During the dry season, you can also drive to Litchfield National Park via Cox Peninsula Road and the 4WD Reynolds Track from Daly River Road in the south.Best Time to VisitMuch like the rest of Australia, the best time visit Litchfield National Park is during the dry season (May through September). While this means less humidity, it’s also high season for the park, and you can expect larger crowds at the waterfalls.The campsites fill up quickly during these months, especially over the school holidays. During the wet season (November to March), the waterfalls are their most impressive though there is a chance for flash floods which do cause the areas to close. Like anywhere else, the weather can be unpredictable so you’ll want to come prepared!Where to Stay in Litchfield National ParkLitchfield National Park has a wide variety of accommodation options for every type of traveler. Whether you’re a backpacker, family, couple, caravanner, or camper, there is an option to suit your style and budget.The HomesteadThe Homestead is for private use only and is perfect for larger groups. It sleeps up to 15 people and is made up of 2 air-conditioned rooms with queen beds, a dorm area with one double bed and nine single beds, a lounge, kitchen, a dining room, and an outdoor seating area complete with a barbeque.Ringer’s CabinsSet amongst the trees, the Ringer’s Cabins allow you to experience the wilderness of the Northern Territory. The standard cabin can sleep up to five people, and the larger cabin can sleep six. Each cabin comes with a bathtub, indoor and outdoor showers, air conditioning, satellite TVs, a kitchen, a BBQ, and an outdoor seating area.Stockman’s CabinsHidden among tropical gardens, the Stockman’s cabins are perfect for traveling couples or solo travelers. There’s a single queen bed, an ensuite bathroom, TV, a small kitchen, and a BBQ on a big verandah.CampingThere are six different campsites within Litchfield National Park. They include 2-WD camping, 4-WD camping, and walk-in camping. All campsites are paid for on arrival and work on a first come, first serve basis.If you’re looking to stay for an extended period, Wangi Falls (a 2-WD campsite) is the only one that offers camping for caravans and showers for visitors. The camping fees are either $3.30 pppn or $6.60 pppn, depending on whether or not the campsite has showers or not.Outside the ParkIf you don’t want to stay inside the national park, there are tons of nearby accommodation options. One of the closest hotels to the park is the Litchfield Motel. It’s an affordable option that will give you easy access to the park and the surrounding area for day trips.Things to See in Litchfield National ParkTolmer Falls View PointLocated just a short drive off of the main road, Tolmer Falls Viewpoint is hidden away in a narrow gorge yet offers views of arguably one of the most gorgeous falls in the park. The drop-off at the falls is roughly 102 meters and is absolutely picturesque. I highly recommend visiting at sunset! The sun lights up the rocks, and they change from a magnificent orange to a soft red as the day comes to an end.Buley RockholeIf Australia’s heat is getting to you, spend a few hours cooling off at the Buley Rockhole. There’s a series of cascading waterfalls that create small swimming pools along the stream.Wangi FallsThe Wangi Falls is one of the most popular waterfalls in Litchfield National Park. There is a massive plunge pool to help you beat the heat, and you can also tackle the 3km loop trail that will take you to the top of the waterfall for a spectacular view of the landscape. Keep in mind that the pool by the falls isn’t always open as it depends on how much rainfall the area has had that year.   Magnetic Termite MoundsLitchfield National Park is full of termite mounds. With some of them standing at over 2m high, you’ll easily see these unusual hills from the park’s main road. It’s definitely one of the park’s most unique and bizarre attractions!Florence FallsFlorence Falls is where two waterfalls meet and create a series of small rock pools. You’ll find plenty of underwater rock formations and a few fish in the river to keep you company. If you want to get a good spot, come here early!Book a Helicopter FlightOne of the best ways to see Litchfield National Park is with a scenic helicopter flight over the Lost City. The ride will also take you past Wangi Falls, and the  Tjaetaba and Tolmer waterfalls.OverallIf you’re heading to the Top End anytime soon, I highly recommend adding a trip to Litchfield National Park on your itinerary. With stunning waterfalls, beautiful natural pools, and bizarre termite mounds, it’s a one-of-a-kind experience!Do you have any tips for visiting Litchfield National Park?

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-kakadu-national-park/,The Ultimate Guide to Kakadu National Park,Australia,"Covering nearly 20,000 square km, the Kakadu National Park is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. With its exotic wildlife and landscapes and aboriginal rock art, it’s one of Australia’s top UNESCO World Heritage Sites.Here is my ultimate guide to Kakadu National Park! Getting ThereThe easiest way to get to Kakadu National Park is to fly into Darwin or Alice Springs. Once you land, you can rent a car and drive the rest of the way to the park.If you want to combine it with a mini road trip, take the Red Centre Way from Alice Springs. It’s up to you how many stops you want to make along the way, but the incredible desert scenery is worth it!Just be sure to refuel as much as possible! Getting AroundKakadu National Park is a massive place. It’s going to take you a while to get around, and you’ll need a 4WD for some of the unpaved roads.I recommend splurging and getting a 4WD so you’ll have more control over your itinerary!If you don’t want to hire a car while you’re in Australia, you can join a tour. The only downside is that you won’t have as much time as you might want at the different attractions. What to Know Before You GoTo get into Kakadu National Park, you’ll have to pay an entrance fee. It’s $25 AUD for adults and $12.50 AUD for children between the ages of 5 to 15.If you’re traveling with your family, you can get a group pass for $65 AUD. It’s good for two adults and two children and is valid for an entire week.You can purchase your tickets online or at the gate when you arrive. Where to StayKakadu National Park has a range of accommodations for every kind of traveler. Whether you’re planning a romantic getaway into the Australian wilderness or you’re on a tight budget, there are plenty of spots to choose from.Bamarru Plains: Located in the middle of the park’s wilderness is the Bamarru Plains. The hotel is home to one of the largest crocodile populations in the world. Book a night or two here and watch the hundreds of birds make their way across the landscape as you unwind in the infinity-edge pool. With only ten safari-style bungalows, it’s an intimate getaway that’s perfect for nature-loving couples.Kakadu Lodge: Kakadu Lodge has a range of accommodation options. Choose from the self-catering cabins or bring along your tent and spend a night camping underneath the stars. The lodge also organizes tours, making it a great option for solo travelers. Once you’re back from exploring the park, you can relax at the lagoon style pool or wander around the manicured gardens. There’s also a bar and bistro and a few spots where you can barbeque.Cooinda Lodge: Cooinda Lodge is a great option for families or groups of friends visiting Kakadu National Park. It offers 48 spacious, air-conditioned rooms that can accommodate up to four people. There’s also a large swimming pool, a gift shop, and a general store. It’s perfect for picking up some last-minute supplies or a few souvenirs.If you’re really looking to splurge, you can head to the private airstrip to charter a plane! Things to DoSunset/Sunrise at Nourlangie Rock Viewpoint: Pack a light breakfast or bring along a bottle of wine and head up to the Nourlangie Rock Viewpoint. It’s one of the best spots inside Kakadu National Park for incredible views over the landscape. Plus, you’ll pass ancient rock art sites your way up to the top.Aboriginal Art at Ubirr: Ubirr is one of the main rock art galleries inside the park. Stop by for a visit, and you can see paintings that are over 20,000 years old. It makes the artwork here one of the longest historical records kept by a group of people on Earth.Swim at the Gunlom Plunge Pool: Made famous by the 1986 movie Crocodile Dundee, the infinity-edge pool at the top of the falls boasts some of the best views in Australia. At the top, you’ll find shaded picnic areas and campgrounds with solar-powered showers.Moline Falls: Moline Falls is off the beaten path, and it’s another beautiful swimming spot in the national park. The water is incredibly clear at the base of the falls, but the water is freezing.Jim Jim Falls and Twin Falls: No trip to Kakadu would be complete without a visit to these two spectacular waterfalls. Jim Jim only flows after the wet season, but the Twins gush over a 220-meter drop throughout the year. These falls aren’t the easiest to get to but the views are definitely worth it!Hiking Trails: Kakadu is home to more than 30 established walking trails. You can find short, easy strolls or challenging multi-day treks. Roam past the rock art galleries, walk past multiple waterfalls and pools, and bring plenty of water and sunscreen.Yellow Waters Cruise: The sunset cruise on the Yellow Waters Billabong is by far one of the most popular activities in Kakadu. You’re almost guaranteed to see crocodiles, around 280 species of birds, wallabies, horses, buffalo, snakes, and other critters.Helicopter Tour: During peak season (and wet season), many of the areas of the park are closed off. Jim Jim Falls (the tallest falls in the park) closed to tourists when it’s at its peak and during the wet season before it has been checked for crocodiles. The only way to see it during peak season is with a helicopter tour.Not only does it give you a unique perspective but it also gives you access to one of the best spots of the park. OverallVisiting the Australian Outback is an unforgettable experience that you’ll want to share with everyone you know. Between the wildlife, the rock art, the waterfalls, and the overall richness of the culture, Kakadu National Park has so much to offer. Do you have any tips for visiting Kakadu National Park?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/itinerary-for-australias-great-big-outback/,Itinerary for Australia’s Great Big Outback,Australia,"Australia is one of my favorite places on the planet. During one of my first big international adventures, I traveled far and wide to see the best of the land “down unda.” On my second visit to Australia a few years later, I adventured deep into the Red Center to experience the Australian Outback.The Outback is an absolutely massive place, and it’s one that I think deserves a spot on every traveler’s bucket list. From Alice Springs to Kata Tjuta and beyond, this vast red desert is truly magical.Ready for a trip you’ll never forget? Here’s my itinerary for Australia’s Great Big Outback.Day 1: Alice SpringsStart your adventure in Alice Springs. You can fly there from most major airports or drive from the city.There is a lot to do in Alice Springs so plan plenty of time to explore. Check out spots like the Kangaroo Sanctuary, Aboriginal Art Galleries, Uluru Mala walk and Alice Springs Desert Park.It’s the second largest town in the Northern Territory, and it’s a major hub for tourism because it’s a popular gateway into the Outback.Uluru also has some of the most epic sunsets! Don’t miss the changing colors of the red rocks as the sun descends, it’s truly magic.Read More: Tips for Visiting Alice SpringsDay 2: Uluru and Kings CreekThere’s nothing more beautiful than watching the sun rise over the red rocks, so, start your day at Uluru for sunrise.At Uluru, you’ll find the Aboriginal Cultural Centre which is the perfect place to learn more about the native culture. Sample the indigenous food, learn about bush medicine, and have your eyes opened to a completely different way of life.The Valley of the Winds is the perfect place for a long walk or hike. Uluru looks completely different depending on the lighting, so I’d also suggest getting to a location from which you can watch the sunset hit the rock. (Pack a bottle of bubbles and some snacks to make the moment extra special!)Once you’re worn out, get to Kings Creek Station to spend the night under the stars.Optional Activities: Helicopter Ride or Quad Biking Off-Road Tour.Read More:Tips for Planning Your Trip to UluruKata Tjuta and Hiking Valley of the WindsDay 3: Kings CanyonStart your day with an early hike through the gorges and valleys of Kings Canyon in Watarrka National Park. If you have the time, I’d highly recommended hopping on a camel. Some tours run through Uluru, Alice Springs, through the Ilparpa Valley, the MacDonnell Ranges, and Kings Canyon.You will find some good glamping options around the area or you can make the relatively short trip back to stay in Alice Springs where there’s a good range of everything from hostels to luxe hotels and resorts.Read More:Hiking King’s Canyon in Australia’s OutbackDay 4: Ghan Train and Alice SpringsOne of my fave experiences in the Outback (and all of Australia!) was the Ghan Train. It’s a throwback from the golden age of rail travel, and it’s such a cool experience.You can experience The Ghan trip from Alice Springs to Katherine, which is a two-day journey that goes through some of the best areas around Australia’s Northern Territory.If you can make the time for it, I’d recommend checking out The Ghan Expedition. This epic journey is three days and four nights through The Bush. It will take you from coast to coast for the 1851 mile (2,979km) trip from Adelaide to Darwin.When you opt to take the long trip, you’ll get to see the incredibly diverse landscape from the stunning red scenery of the MacDonnell Ranges down to the lush tropical region around Katherine and Darwin.I made the trip from Alice Springs up to Darwin / Katherine. I loved it and, because the train leaves in the evening, it gave me the chance to explore more of Alice Springs.Day 5: Katherine GorgeAfter an overnight train from Alice Springs, you’ll arrive at Katherine. The train stops for approximately 4 hours, so you can explore Katherine Gorge by flat-bottomed boat, a scenic helicopter ride, or with a walk around the gorge to enjoy the views.Day 6: Darwin / Litchfield Park (Disembark Ghan Train)You’ll disembark the Ghan around 7 am, so head out to explore Litchfield National Park. There is so much to see! Be sure to get to Florence Falls, and the Buley Rockhole then make time for a wetland nature cruise to meet the local crocs!Bring a bathing suit to swim at Buley Rockhole (it’s an awesome spot to laze the day away) and be sure to check out the giant termite mounds.You can also take a jumping crocodile cruise to see the saltwater crocodiles!Read More: A Guide to Litchfield National ParkDay 7: Kakadu National ParkHead to Kakadu National Park to check out the Aboriginal Art or hike down the gorge to take a dip in the pools below. There is a lot to learn about Australian Aboriginal culture here so take advantage of the opportunity.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Kakadu National ParkDay 8: Gunlom Falls to DarwinBefore heading all the way to Darwin, pack your bathing suit and head to the incredible Gunlom falls. Take a short trek to the top of the falls to find more pools to swim in. From up top, you’ll find an amazing viewpoint that looks over southern Kakadu.NOTE: Gunlom Falls is only accessible during the dry season (April to October).Ikoymarrwa is also a perfect spot for swimming. The access road is rough and restricted, so it’s normally less crowded.The area at the bottom of the falls is a great, peaceful spot to lounge and take in your surroundings.Finish your trip in Darwin and explore the Top End of Australia. With a ton of history and beautiful gardens and beaches, there’s a ton to see and do!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/jumping-crocodile-cruise-in-darwin-australia/,"Jumping Crocodile Cruise in Darwin, Australia",Australia,"Attention, adventure lovers! If you are looking for the trip of a lifetime, you need to get to the Australian bush. While the cities down under are incredible, there is nothing like getting out of town and seeing the natural beauty and wonder of Australia.I spent two months in the Australian Outback and completely fell in love with the country. From diving the Great Barrier Reef to hiking the Outback to soaking in the sun on the Gold Coast, I had so many unforgettable experiences here. In fact, Sydney is the official birthplace of “The Blonde Abroad.” Looking out over the Sydney Harbour, I realized just how deep my wanderlust ran.Are you ready for a trip that will turn you on your head? Here’s what you need to know about exploring the Northern Territory and my experience on a Jumping Crocodile Cruise in Darwin, Australia!Visiting the Northern TerritoryWhile it is a bit out of the way, the Northern Territory is well worth the trip. I highly recommend exploring Alice Springs and hopping on the old school Ghan Train. I adore train travel and that is one trip I recommend for anybody’s bucket list.Of course, you have got to get to the capital of Australia’s Northern Territory, Darwin. This tropical city has a lot to offer and it’s a perfect stopover if you are traveling on to Asia.You can easily spend a few days exploring but my all time fave experience in Darwin was the crazy Jumping Crocodile Cruise.The Jumping Crocodile CruiseGoing on a Jumping Crocodile Cruise is an essential experience for any visitor in the Northern Territory. You hop on board at a spot that is just over an hour drive from Darwin and the cruise goes down the Adelaide River. There are usually four cruises per day during the dry season, which runs from May to October in the Northern Territory.The Jumping Crocodile Cruise is a terrifying but awesome (but terrifying!) experience. Exactly as advertised, these crocs will jump up all around the boat.In fact, I couldn’t believe how close they got to us!We saw massive crocodiles everywhere we went and they all had names. The cruise crew had massive hunks of meat that were very popular amongst the crocs. They jump up to grab a snack, which creates a perfect photo op. Since the boat is small and the crocs aren’t shy, you can easily snap some close-ups.There was an endless stream of crocs and impressive birds all over as we floated down the Adelaide River. Unfortunately for our four-legged friends, there were always hawks ready to steal the meat away from the crocodiles!Some of the crocs had unforgettable personalities (like the 80-year-old who had lost one of his legs in a fight with a shark!) which made the trip even more fun. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-australias-gold-coast/,Visiting Australia’s Gold Coast,Australia,"Famous for its gorgeous beaches and world class surfing, Australia’s Gold Coast is one of the country’s greatest gems. Set along the Pacific Ocean, this iconic region spans 57 kilometers (35 miles) of coastline. From tropical rainforests to foodie delights to cool markets to heart-stopping amusement parks, the Gold Coast has something for everyone.Ready for an adventure down under? Here’s my guide to visiting Australia’s Gold Coast.Getting ThereThe Gold Coast is located on the east coast of Australia. It’s just a one-hour drive south of Brisbane. While I’d definitely recommend renting a car for exploring the country, it’s easy to get from the Brisbane airport to the Gold Coast.There’s a local service called Airtrain that runs from the Brisbane Airport to the Gold Coast every 15 minutes (or every 30 minutes during off-peak times) so it’s really easy to get there on public transport if you prefer.Why It’s PopularThe Gold Coast is the ultimate getaway destination for people living in Brisbane. It was first known as the South Coast but earned its “Gold Coast” title back in the 50s thanks to the ultra exclusive (and pricey!) local real estate.Since that time, this Queensland’s region has become everything to everyone. Way more than just a surfer’s paradise, the Gold Coast gets an incredible 300 days of sunshine per year and has endless natural beauty.What to DoGo Surfing: You just can’t go to the Gold Coast without surfing! There are so many amazing spots for newbies and pros alike.One of the most popular spots is the Duranbah Beach (which is actually just north of the Gold Coast in New South Wales). For consistently flawless waves, Burleigh Heads is the place to be for the famous “Burleigh barrels” waves.At the southern side of Rainbow Bay, there is Snapper Rocks. There you will find the famous area known as Superbank, which is made up of Rainbow Bay, Duranbah, and Kirra.Get Your Heart Racing: As the amusement park capital of Australia, the Gold Coast is a thrill seeker’s dream come true. First of all, there is the Australia’s largest theme park, Dreamworld, which has more shows and rides than you could possibly fit into one day.Another Aussie number one is Wet’n’Wild Waterworld. This is the biggest water park in the country and it’s full of slides and pools. To cool down, WhiteWater World is the place to be for epic water slides.Whale Watching: On top of top notch surfing, the waters off the Gold Coast are an ideal spot for whale watching. The prime time is from May to November every year.On any given whale watching cruise, there is a good chance that you will get to see Australian Humpback whales. These are an especially cool sight, because Australian Humpback whales love to ham it up for a crowd.Be sure to bring your camera!If you’re lucky enough to be on the Gold Coast during October and November, try to catch a whale watching cruise. At that time of year, the whales are heading south for the summer so you’ll see mothers and adorable babies on their annual trips.Foodie Hotspots: While Australia isn’t exactly known for its great cuisine, the Gold Coast is a foodie’s dream come true. From local cheese makers to impressive fusion plates, you are going to be blown away.I would highly recommend checking out one of the Gold Coast food and wine tours.If you have time, there are some world class wineries and distilleries. Visit big name spots like Cedar Creek Estate Vineyards and Tamborine Mountain Distillery.Another place to try local eats is the Hinterland Markets. You can meet the local farmers, try specialty fare, and find the perfect souvenir amongst the handicraft stands.Get OutdoorsAustralia has so many cute animals. You can’t leave the land down under without seeing a koala bear at the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary! Then head over to Australia’s Daintree Rainforest to explore one of the oldest rainforests on the planet.And, thrill seekers, be sure to make time for Canyon Flyer! They have got a nearly 200-foot-tall zip line that will have you flying through the air at more than 40 miles per hour."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-australias-daintree-rainforest/,Visiting Australia’s Daintree Rainforest,Australia,"While Australia has some gorgeous cities, you have got to get away from the hustle and bustle of urban life to soak in the incredible natural beauty of this country. The Daintree Rainforest sits on the northeastern coast of Queensland.Not only is this place stunning and full of photo ops, it is actually one of the oldest rainforests on the planet. I visited the Daintree Rainforest during my time in Cairns. If you’re planning on diving the Great Barrier Reef, be sure to plan enough time to see Daintree as well!Ready to go down under? Here’s what it is like visiting Australia’s Daintree Rainforest.Why It’s FamousThe Daintree Rainforest is said to be more than 130 million years old! It is widely considered to be the oldest continuously surviving tropical rainforest in the world (though Taman Negara in Malaysia is also somewhere around 130 million years old so there is some debate on which might be the real queen of rainforests).With a lush canopy, the Daintree Rainforest is filled with ancient ferns and emerald foliage. At 1,200 square kilometers (460 sq. mi.), the Daintree is also the largest tropical rainforest on the Australian continent.How to Get  ThereThe best option for getting to the Daintree Rainforest is drive your own car or rent a car! If you are exploring rural Australia, it will make your life so much easier to have a rental vehicle.Public transport is limited and having a set of wheels gives you so much more independence. The closest place to the Daintree Rainforest is the city of Cairns, which is a worthwhile stop in its own right.With a population around 140,000 people, Cairns is considered to be the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef. It is also the perfect place to learn about the indigenous people of Australia.At the Tjapukai Aboriginal Cultural Park, you can learn about the local culture. There are some good restaurants and bars to check out around town, plus a swimming lagoon for cooling down.Once you are ready to hit the wide open road, Cairns is about a 90-minute drive from the city and there’s free parking once you get there. Just head over to Cairns airport (or there are daily flights into the airport here from Sydney, Brisbane, and beyond) then go north on Captain Cook Highway.From the airport, it’s about a two-hour drive.While renting a car is the easiest way to get there, you’ve got the option of getting to the rainforest by bus. Coral Reef Coaches goes twice a day from Cairns to Cape Tribulation, and they will stop at Daintree Rainforest on request.Daintree Rainforest ToursThe thing I love about Daintree Rainforest is that they offer genuine eco-tourism and informative guides. There are four different tour options, ranging from two to four hours each.You can opt for the two-hour Grand Fan Palm Gallery Tour, or the full four-hour Greater Wilderness Experience. For either of those tour options, you can add on a mangrove discovery cruise or a stop at a local rainforest restaurant for afternoon tea.All of the tour options are led by local experts who will teach you an incredible amount about this complex one of a kind ecosystem. Whether you are an avid nature lover and hiker or just looking for a beautiful place to explore, Daintree is worth the trip."

https://theblondeabroad.com/hiking-kings-canyon-in-australias-outback/,Hiking Kings Canyon in Australia’s Outback,Australia,"Hiking Kings Canyon is often an unexpected highlight for visitors of the Red Centre. While the National Park does not share the expectations of its more famous neighbor Uluru, I highly recommend adding it to your Australian Outback itinerary to experience the region in a whole new way.Find out about my experience hiking Kings Canyon in Australia’s Outback!Hiking Kings CanyonThe best way to see Kings Canyon is on foot. So grab those walking shoes and prepare yourself for a captivating 6-kilometer walk around the rim of the canyon.It’s pretty flat for the most part though the initial steep ascent may seem a bit daunting.The Canyon itself has no fences or railing around the rim so exercise caution at all times. Make sure you wear sunscreen and have enough water for the hike. Though 6km may not seem like a lot, with the scenery along the way you are bound to make a stop every so often (with the blazing sun overhead).It’s a good idea to make your photo stops a rehydration session as well. While the rim walk is the most common and straightforward way of experiencing the canyon, there are many other walks available that vary in length and intensity.There is even a wheel-chair friendly walk that takes you into the very heart of the canyon which is known as the Creek Walk. The 22km Giles Track Walk is more intense and often carried out overnight.Be sure to make a visit to the sunset viewing deck for some of the most spectacular views and colors.The best time to hike the Kings Canyon would be in the cooler months of the year which are from May to September. This period of the year has little rain, clear skies and most importantly, cooler temperatures.If you do opt to go in the hotter months please be wary of the intense weather and prepare yourself in advance. It’s also better to hike early in the day and be down from the rim by around 10 A.M. to avoid the harshest sunlight.About Kings CanyonKings Canyon is around 320 km from Alice Springs, the gateway to the Red Centre. The Canyon forms part of Watarrka National Park which is one of the major attractions in central Australia.The national park has significance both locally and on an international level for its significant conservation area. It is believed that Watarrka National Park is home to over 600 different species of plants and native animals.You may catch a glimpse of some on your way to the Kings Canyon. At a staggering 100 meters high, the flaming canyon walls overlook areas of dense vegetation.Ferns and cycads occur most commonly. This outback oasis is referred to as The Garden of Eden and is a stark contrast to its dry surroundings.You may even come across ghost gum which has a variety of uses for the locals. Another surprising feature is the gorgeous white sand around the area.The canyon itself came into existence as a result of a compression of sand on a shallow inland sea. The Beehive Domes are also must-sees when hiking the canyon.Weathering has shaped these domes over time and the result is stunning. Kathleen Springs, a shady waterhole, isn’t too far off either and offers great bird-watching potential.It’s also worth noting that Kings Canyon is super absorbent, with its soft sandstone composition acting as a sponge after heavy rains. The sandstone then feeds the plants in the region, contributing to the luscious surrounds in a magical way.There really is more than what meets the eye with this place. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-alice-springs/,Tips for Visiting Alice Springs,Australia,"Dubbed the gateway to Australia’s glorious Red Centre, Alice Springs, or just ‘Alice’ as it is affectionately known, has been a popular pit stop for those venturing into the likes of Uluru, Kata Tjuta, and Kings Canyon.The seemingly small and remote area is the second largest town in the Northern Territory, following closely after Darwin. There’s a lot to offer, particularly for travelers — it’s home to an impressive wildlife park, various cultural points of interest and some pretty good dining options.As the main hub of the Australian Outback, you’ll need these top tips for visiting Alice Springs!Getting to Alice SpringsLocated at virtually the centre of Australia, Alice Springs is around a 16-hour drive from most areas. Prep properly if you decide to brave the long road!There is also the option to fly in, with direct flights available from most major city airports (through Qantas or Virgin Australia).Where to StayWith every level of accommodation on offer, Alice Springs has something for everyone. Choose between desert luxury or a free site to pitch the trusty tent (like I did!).Finding a place to stay is pretty straightforward in Alice. You are likely to see some familiar names, such as Hilton DoubleTree and Mercure. These are great options if you are playing it safe.If you’re pulling through in your caravan or simply want some steady ground to set up your camp, I would suggest taking a look at Alice Springs Tourist Park.Peaceful and generously equipped, this park caters to solo travelers as well as big families. Since you’re likely to be staying in Alice for just a day or two, make sure it is somewhere memorable.Activities in Alice SpringsVisit the Kangaroo Sanctuary: In my opinion, no visit to Alice Springs is complete without a visit to the Kangaroo Sanctuary. The experience is unforgettable!This sanctuary is home to the cutest joeys and some of the toughest kangaroos of the region.Journey on the Larapinta Trail:While the full trail of 223km may not be on everyone’s list, Larapinta can be explored through one of its 12 different sections. It is definitely worth attempting at least part of the trek.Enjoy scenic gorges, mountainous peaks, and countless waterholes along the way.Some parts are particularly strenuous, particularly in hotter months. I would advise walking on one of the guided tours which are usually less intensive and also offer great insight into the geology of the region.Take a Trip to the Aboriginal Art Galleries:Aboriginal art can be viewed throughout Alice Springs, with Papunya Tula Gallery and Araluen Arts Centre being of the popular choices for visitors. These traditional artworks are truly magnificent. You can choose to view them in the bigger galleries or in the tiny galleries located by Todd Mall.Experience the Alice Springs Desert Park:If you have the time, I would recommend taking an afternoon to explore the desert park for an educational and enriching experience.The Alice Springs Desert Park offers visitors a unique walking experience through various environments.These include the woodland, sandy country, and even desert rivers. On these walks, you can get to know about all the conservation efforts they have in place to preserve and protect the native plants and animals.Helpful Tip: With Alice Springs being the only proper town in the heart of Australia it’s the perfect place to stock up on some essentials before heading back on to the road. With a decent sized shopping center, you can easily pack in some supplies, stock up on snacks and even squeeze in a trip to the bank."
https://theblondeabroad.com/riding-the-ghan-train-in-australias-outback/,Riding the Ghan Train in Australia’s Outback,Australia,"Riding the Ghan Train in Australia’s Outback is one of the most charming and adventurous ways you can explore South Australia. Immerse yourself in the Northern Territory across the expanses of the Outback.I’ve always been a lover of train travel so I was incredibly excited to explore the great outback from Alice Springs to Darwin/Katherine by train. Riding the Ghan Train is the perfect way to explore the center of Australia.Ready to book your trip on the Ghan Train? Here’s everything you need to know about riding the Ghan Train in Australia’s outback!Rooms on the Ghan TrainSometimes during a busy trip, I crave a bit of privacy. Just some time in which I can be alone and recollect my thoughts.I loved that with The Ghan Gold Service I was able to get away for a while in my private sleeper.Gold Service cabins come in two options; you can choose between a two-berth if you’re traveling with someone else or a single-berth if you’ve decided to explore the outback solo.History of The GhanI love knowing the history of places I travel to, so this was a special experience for me! The name “Ghan” originates from 19th-century folklore when cameleers established paths in the Red Center.At the time, the cameleers were believed to have come from Afghanistan. However, it’s now known that they were actually from modern-day Pakistan.The Ghan was originally called the Afghan Express in 1929, but the name was eventually changed to The Ghan.Originally, The Ghan was used to transfer people and supplies to Alice Springs. In the early 2000’s the tracks were replaced, and the train received a modern look. Today, the north to south cross-country journey covers 2979 kilometers and passes through diverse landscapes from the stunning South Australian plains, to the rusty reds of the MacDonnell Ranges, to the tropical greens of Katherine and Darwin.The Ghan train is now one of the worlds’ most iconic rail lines.Riding from Alice Springs to Katherine on The GhanThe Ghan is specifically designed to evoke the golden age of rail travel. I felt this as soon as I got on board! The Ghan from Alice Springs to Katherine is a two-day journey through the heart of Australia’s Northern Territory.From the Red Center through the lush Top End, you get to experience the best of Australia’s Outback.For the ultimate experience, book The Ghan Expedition, a three night and four-day adventure, that takes you coast to coast (2,979km) between Adelaide and Darwin.Food on The Ghan TrainAnyone who knows me also knows how much I enjoy good food! The Ghan serves amazing regionally-sourced Australian food that is both tasty and fresh.Complement your food with beer, wines and non-alcoholic beverages. Experience all kinds of Australian cuisine from Margaret River cheeses to Top End barramundi.Depending on the class of your booking, you can have all meals and beverages included, as well as off-train excursions.Experience the Australian OutbackYou cannot help but feel completely taken in by the spectacular scenery that the Outback has to offer on board The Ghan. Trust me when I say that you’ll find it a struggle to stop staring, as you’ll be afraid that you’ll miss something great.It is an incredible experience to be transported from the gorgeous rusty hues of the Red Center to the amazingly lush green hills surrounding the Adelaide. Plus always be on the lookout for kangaroos!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/kata-tjuta-and-hiking-valley-of-the-winds/,Kata Tjuta and Hiking Valley of the Winds,Australia,"While most people are familiar with Uluru, not as many are aware of the other red gem that resides in the great outback. Visiting Kata Tjuta and hiking Valley of the Winds is as impressive as its more famous neighbor.The site is estimated to be over 500 million years old!In fact, when you visit Uluru, you are actually entering the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. For this reason, people visiting Uluru factor in a trip to Kata Tjuta as well.Here is my experience exploring the majestic Kata Tjuta and hiking Valley of the Winds!Discovering Kata TjutaKata Tjuta is a series of 36 domes around 564 meters above the ground. It’s taller than Uluru and is believed to have been one giant formation that weathered down over the years.The result? A series of unusual and magnificent peaks. Referred to as The Olgas for some time, it was restored to its original name as a respectful gesture to the Aboriginal people.The area was originally owned by the Anangu people for around 30,000 years. The local Aboriginal people and Parks Australia now manage the area.Located just 30km from Uluru, Kata Tjuta forms a part of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. The park is also classified as a UNESCO world heritage site.With both natural and cultural significance, the area represents one of the oldest civilizations on earth. It also has some of the most fascinating geology discovered to date.When you get to Kata Tjuta, you can either choose to admire it from the road or venture into the region on one of the two accessible routes. Although there are several tracks in the area, only the Anangu tribes can roam freely.The land is extremely important to the natives. With the high tourist traffic to Uluru, Kata Tjuta has become the primary location for tribal ceremonies by the Anangu.Should you opt to take a walk, I recommend the Valley of the Winds over the Walpa Gorge (which is the shorter and easier route, but less satisfying).Valley of the Winds HikeHaving braved the 7.4km circuit route myself, I can assure you it’s worth the steep incline. The hike is likely to take you around 3-4 hours and you need to be moderately fit to manage.Remember that it also gets extremely hot here! It’s best to start early to avoid the harshest sun.Allow yourself time to absorb the scenic surroundings and take some picture perfect shots for the gram. And be sure to wear comfortable shoes! Hydration is essential, so stock up on water beforehand. There is a less strenuous hike to the Karu lookout that is just 2km from the starting point.Though I strongly advise getting to the Karinga Lookout if you can manage. The views are so worth it!Having done the loop trail through the region, I can safely say it’s the most meaningful way of exploring Kata Tjuta. With an overwhelming amount of beauty surrounding you, it’s quite difficult to pinpoint a specific moment as a favorite.One of the most spectacular moments for me was when we arrived at a split between two of the rock formations. Steep wall faces open up to showcase distant rock domes while the valley below is splattered with greenery. The sight of the red rocks and green plant life against the bright blue skies is magical.Also planning to visit Uluru? Check out my tips for Uluru!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-planning-your-trip-to-uluru/,Tips for Planning Your Trip to Uluru,Australia,"Update: November 2019Uluru is taller than the Eiffel Tower and is made of arkosic sandstone. A magical trip to Uluru in the Outback is likely to near the top of most traveler’s bucket lists when venturing to Australia.I had the pleasure of exploring Australia’s Outback back in 2013, and I definitely see myself revisiting the region. Planning a trip to Uluru, or Ayers Rock as it is sometimes known requires a fair amount of thought.Being among the top attractions in Australia, there are tons of ways to experience Uluru. This guide will help you plan your trip to Uluru with ease! Be Aware of the Aboriginal RequestsAlthough the signs around the site are hard to miss, I would suggest you take a look at what is requested of visitors by the native people who consider this massive sandstone formation theirs. The site holds historical significance to the native people of the area (known as the Anangu).Uluru is a very sacred place to the Aboriginal people of Australia. There is a lot of controversy around climbing Uluru, and as of October 2019, you can no longer climb it.There are also requests to refrain from photographing certain areas and not capturing the native Anangu in images. There are many chilling tales of misfortune at the Visitor’s Center cautioning visitors to respect these requests.Be Wary of the DistancesI drove through from Alice Springs which takes around 5 hours. I discovered that there are long distances to cover when traveling to and from the rock itself. It is essential that you take these factors into account when deciding on the duration of your stay.You will be doing yourself a real injustice if you visit Uluru without experiencing it entirely. The accommodation area is around 20km’s from the rock which is a significant 40km journey roundtrip.The journey around the base of Uluru is 11km and can take a while longer because of various photo stops or a trip to the Visitor’s Center.Plan a Trip to UluruTaking into account the amount of traveling involved and the different experiences to indulge in, I recommend a two or three-day stay at Uluru. A 3-day itinerary will safely allow you to experience a sunrise AND sunrise, plus a trip to Kata Tjuta (about 50km from Uluru).Be sure to include a visit to the cultural center and some time to venture onto one (or two) of the many amazing walking experiences offered. Anything shorter is likely to feel rushed.Top Ways to Experience UluruExperience the View from Lasseter Highway Sand DuneThe unofficial viewing area from this spot provides a spell-binding first look at the rock. Located around 20km from the entrance into Uluru-Kata Tjuta Park, it is unmissable when driving in.Set your Sights on a Spectacular Sunrise and SunsetThis one tops the list by far. One of the most magical things about Uluru is that it looks completely different at dawn, during the day and at dusk.Natural light influences the color of the colossal rock formation, so it’s impossible to choose a favorite time!Sunrise shows Uluru off in a flaming red which then settles into the terracotta hue for the day. At sunset, it all changes again, bearing a striking reddish hue before settling into a dusky pink for nightfall.Sunrise and sunset tours are very popular at Uluru with great photo opportunities and good wine.Do the Base-Walk Around UluruUluru is best experienced by venturing on a walk around the base. The base walk is 10.6km and mostly flat.Apart from a small area of sandy footing the walk not too demanding. There are a few drinking stations along the way and no shade on the backside of the rock. I suggest taking a hat, lots of water and comfortable shoes!It’s also a good idea to get started early to avoid harsh sunlight. A camel ride around part of the perimeter is another an interesting way of experiencing Uluru.You can also rent bicycles for more adventures!Visit the viewing deck at Kata TjutaKata Tjuta is a marvel of its own. Whilst there be sure to look out for Uluru from the dune viewing area. The captivating site provides yet another view of Uluru and is a great option for sunrise or sunset as well.Decide on ActivitiesWith so many different options, it’s a good idea to get a head start on choosing activities beforehand. Camel rides, sunset drinks, outback cycling, sand dunes and guided walks are just a handful of what is offered.I suggest putting together a list of your personal must do’s. It’s also a good idea to book certain activities in advance and confirm the day before.Visiting Uluru is going to leave you spellbound. While taking pictures and documenting your time is important, don’t forget to take a step back and revel in the beauty of it all. Remember to enjoy every second of your trip!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/find-best-food-sydney/,Where to Find the Best Food in Sydney,Australia,"Last Christmas and New Years I spent two weeks visiting friends in Sydney, Australia. I am extremely lucky that I have a large group of very close friends that live there, so not only did I experience life like a local in Bondi Beach for the duration of my stay, but I also got some major insight into life as a true Aussie- going out the way they do, spending my days the way they do, and of course, eating the way they do.The below is representative of an array of different ways of eating out in Sydney, though it is admittedly a bit heavy on the tried and true – and now pretty famous, #avocadotoast – Australian breakfast.  Here’s where to find the best food in Sydney! The ApolloThe Apollo blew me away. I loved the feel of it-  nautical, spacious and crisp looking. Dozens of seating options around the large bar. Killer food, highlight being the honey drenched pot of bubbling saganaki cheese, covered with rosemary and oregano. Unforgettable.  10 William Street10 William Street had only recently opened when I was in Sydney and I stopped by en route to the airport for one last meal.  My friend and I ordered half a dozen small plates, all varied and beautiful presented.  10WS is essentially a wine bar with a side of some really great food; always a good combination to be had. Bondi HardwareDuring my two weeks staying in Bondi Beach, I think I ate here 3x. It wasn’t because this was the best food I had ever experienced, but more so because the lunch menu was in fact super solid, the atmosphere calm and easy, and the space open-aired. They offer an authentically Australian avocado smash option, lots of egg variations, French toast, a salad and sandwich or two, and a very healthy but interesting spin on yogurt and granola. I hear the dinner is great, too.Good spot for the start of a fun girls night out.Watson’s Bay Boutique HotelPacked with hoards of beautiful and tan Australians, The Watson’s Bay Boutique Hotel is definitely a destination. Located right on the water, it’s absolutely breathtaking and is an incredible way to spend a weekend afternoon.Mr WongTucked within an alleyway off the busy Central Business District, Mr Wong is a highly impressive Cantonese restaurant offering everything from black truffle mushroom dumplings and crispy fried Balmain Bugs (surprisingly amazing) to the more traditional steamed fish and stir fried pork or chicken options.The food here, and the experience, was exceptional.A TavolaNow boasting two locations- one in Darlinghurst one in Bondi- this self-described authentic Italian restaurant is a solid spot for a more upscale but not crazy stuffy meal.On our order list were delicious grilled carrots over ricotta, pumpkin stuffed ravioli, and black linguine. Porch and ParlourRight on the edge of the end of the beach in North Bondi, Porch and Parlour is an awesome spot to grab a healthy bite- think egg and quinoa bowls, or acai- en route to a day out in the sun. Like all other Aussie brunch haunts, there’s usually a wait, but if you can snag a seat I’d say to do so.Lox Stock & BarrelGreat name, very good food, pretty good scene. Lox is a buzzing and very busy deli/café on Curlewis Street in Bondi, with brunch lines out the door on weekends.There is definitely a reason for that- the food is uber Aussie-style and super tasty, but the chaos of it is slightly deterring. Worth it though in my opinion if you’re up for the challenge. Don’t miss the avo-offering, smashed hard with feta, lemon, mint and tomatoes. ShukShuk is great. It’s on a corner also located in North Bondi, with tables spilling out all over the sidewalk for diners to sit and chat, and obviously, to eat some Israeli food. Their shakshuka is delightful, and they also offer a couple variations on the popular sourdough bread with eggs compilation, among other things. If you’re short on time but still need some delicious coffee and a stuffed pastry or two, Shuk is a great go-to for that, too.MonopoleMonopole in Potts Point was one of those “what’s hot now” sort of spots when I was visiting Sydney. It’s a longish seasonal small plates kind of menu, with dishes like oysters, pork shoulder, seared kingfish, and a ceviche of scallops.A cheeseboard is always on offer too, which is generous with the portions and packs on breads, fruits and honey alongside the brie and gruyere.  The BoathouseThe Boathouse is about a 45 minute drive from Bondi in the upscale Sydney suburb of Palm Beach. The line to order your food (there is no waiter service) is literally out the door and an hour long, but eating here is a lovely experience and a great excuse to see something outside of the city. After dining you can also easily go digest and chill out on the gorgeous cliffside beaches down the road.Read more of Kate’s foodie adventures around the world! Read MoreThe Best Day Trips from SydneyWhere to Travel While the US Dollar is StrongAustralia’s Great Big OutbackSix Travel Budget Busters to Avoid10 Tips for Taking Your First Solo Trip SHOP these Sydney-inspired styles!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1466792277399?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');// ]]&gt; /* ]]> */ "

The crystal-clear water are ideal for scuba diving and snorkeling.Fly down for a couple of days and you won’t regret it!(source)Jervis BayJervis Bay is known for the gorgeous Hyams Beach. Though a bit of a drive from Sydney (3 hours), the pristine white shore alone makes it worth it. Break up your swims with a lunch at the local beach cafe.On the way, be sure to stop by Berry to sample the wines at Silos Estate Vineyard, or the hundreds of chocolates and confectionaries at the Treat Factory.(source)Cockatoo IslandJust a 30-minute boat from Circular Quay, this island is a UNESCO Site as an Australian Convict Site.

https://theblondeabroad.com/goodtimes-for-goodwill/,Goodtimes for Goodwill Russian Winter’s Night,Australia,"Over $8,000 raised for Youngcare!My dear friends Christina, Dale, and Alex are on the Committee for Goodtimes for Goodwill and I was lucky enough to be able to attend their 2011 Russian Winter’s Night themed dinner party benefitting Youngcare.Goodtimes for Goodwill is a not-for-profit organization established by young professionals in Brisbane, Australia.Goodtimes for Goodwill’s mission:“Our mission is to increase awareness of deserving causes within our age group and raise much needed finds for selected Australian and International charities by organising unique social events.”All dressed up and ready for the partyThe formal dinner party called for everyone to dress up in their finest Russian attire with furs, jewels, tattoos, and military inspired uniforms. The fabulous affair was held at Custom House, a stunningly beautiful historic building that sits on the Brisbane river.We were greeted by an Ice Queen and Ballet DancersWhen we arrived at Custom House ballet dancers greeted us, an Ice Queen was on stilts, and there was even snow (brought in by snow machines but 100% magical)!After lots of photos, a few cocktails, and a well deserved snowball fight on the terrace of Custom House, everyone made their way inside.A three-course dinner was carefully prepared, served with fine wine, and endless Moscow Mules! Amidst our dining, professional Russian ballet dancers performed a traditional ballet routine.Snow in Brisbane!So what was the occasion? GtG understands the perfect balance of partying for a purpose! This event raised over $8,000 for Youngcare, a local organization that was established in 2005 for the support of young people in aged care facilities.Right now, there are over 6,500 young Australians living in aged care – simply because there are very limited alternatives. Imagine being in your 20’s, requiring 24/7 care, and being surrounded by elderly with very short life expectancies.Youngcare works hard to raise awareness of this issue and drive change to create choices for young people requiring full-time care.Moscow Mules to themeThe whole event was absolutely incredible! I had so much fun playing dress up, enjoying the delicious food, and cutting loose on the dance floor… especially knowing that our “Good time” was going towards “Goodwill.”A very Russian dinner partyMuch respect GtG!Keep the positive partying going!For more information on Goodtimes for Goodwill, please visit their website: Goodtimes for Goodwill"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-great-barrier-reef/,Diving at the Great Barrier Reef,Australia,"I had booked a short trip up to Cairns, Australia and planned on spending the last day of my trip scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef.Yes, the Great Barrier Reef!I have always been fascinated by the GBR and so I booked an exploration trip before flying home that same night. I couldn’t have been more excited to explore the famous reefs!I booked a trip through Reef Experience that, while an amazing experience, could’ve been my last.I showed up to board the ship at 7 am (as instructed by my confirmation email) and somehow the company never received my booking. Unable to pull up my confirmation because I didn’t have my trusty iPhone, I spent the next 15 minutes trying to convince them to take my money and let me live out one of my lifelong dreamsAfter much persuasion, they let me stay on board and, thankfully, no tears were needed.Helpful Tip #1:Always print booking confirmationsMy anticipation to dive for the first time ever was enormous, not to mention that it was going to be in the GBR. I was pacing the boat back and forth as we set off into the great abyss. I definitely was that token annoying passenger asking the staff a million questions like,“What should I expect?” “Will I see a shark?” “What should I do if I see a shark?”Once we were about an hour out on the deep blue sea, the staff began making their rounds to ask passengers a series of health related questions. After letting them know I was perfectly healthy they asked about my flight information.As I mentioned before, I had planned to fly home later that night.The staff then informed me that I couldn’t dive because there are health risks involved when diving and flying in the same day. I was seriously disappointed in my blunder but I adopted the mindset ‘no scuba… no big deal’. Bring on the snorkel.Helpful Tip #2:There are health risks involved with diving and flying in the same day. Plan accordingly.We eventually made it to the first dive spot after a couple of hours at sea. I was expecting our boat to show up to a beautiful, tropical, deserted island where we would swim through crystal clear water, and endless amounts of colorful reef off the shoreline.To my surprise, most of the reefs are in the middle of the ocean with no land in sight.I’m not one to fear the big blue, but jumping off a huge boat into the middle of the dark depths of the ocean (not to mention in the pouring rain) feels like something out of one of those horror movies.After strapping into my wetsuit, flippers, and snorkel gear, I took a leap of faith and jumped in. Once I was submerged, I had to swim over 100 meters to get to the actual reef.It was one of those situations where I didn’t want to open my eyes because all I would see was endless depths of ocean around me. Do you know that feeling? I pointed myself in the direction of the reef and swam like hell! I don’t think I’ve ever swam so fast!So while it was a bit terrifying to jump out into the middle of the ocean at the first dive spot, as soon as you made it to the reef, it was like a playground of underwater activity.Helpful Tip #3:Don’t believe everything you see in movies.Fish surround you and the reef seems endless. Even though it was pouring rain above the surface, all was peaceful and beautiful under the sea.Our second dive spot was at Hastings. After following the same terrifying, “jump and swim to the reef” routine, I encountered an even more beautiful metropolis under the sea.I crossed paths with a Humphead Maori Wrasse, a few giant clams, and hundreds of other species of sea critters. I even got up close and personal with a reef shark!So, to answer my own question of whether I would see sharks, yes, you just might.I was so mesmerized by the underwater wonder of the reef that I completely lost track of time. I peeked my head up above the water and, while the boat was still off in the distance, there wasn’t anyone else out in the reef with me.Panic struck me as the rain continued to pour down, and the rough surface of the ocean carried me further away from the boat. I had to swim back yet again, through the deep ocean for what felt like an eternity before reaching the boat.As soon as I set foot on the back of the boat, the engines roared and the boat started in the direction back to shore.I came to learn that, because the company never received my confirmation email, I was never listed as a passenger on the boat. I was in the bathroom after the first dive site when the company took role. I had no idea it even happened.When, after everyone was back on board from the second dive site and the crew gave role call for all of the passengers, I freaked out.They didn’t call my name.I went up to the staff-member to let them know the situation with my confirmation and how I paid cash to join the day trip that morning. They also realized I wasn’t on the list.It didn’t occur to me that they wouldn’t be looking for me out at sea! I am not 100% sure the boat started up because it was waiting for me, the last passenger, or if they would have left me out at sea while I was still out hanging with Nemo.Helpful Tip #4:Ensure that you are on the passenger list and make sure the company you dive with checks for all passengers before moving on to the next diving spot.Overall, the trip was everything I had hoped for. It was an all day affair and we didn’t return home until almost 5 pm. While I had a bit of a nervous experience, I would still recommend the company as it was an awesome day trip.I would love to have had more time and more funds to get to do one of the reef trips where you spend a few nights out at sea, like with the overnight sailing tours that offer multiple days of scuba diving at various reef locations.There’s always next time!In regards to my close call of being left to sleep with the fish, I’ve come to learn that it really is a problem with many reef trip companies leaving passengers at sea.Just a few days later an American tourist was left at sea but, luckily, was able to swim to a nearby boat for rescue. I don’t know if I would’ve been so lucky considering we were the only boat at our diving locations. Hopefully this isn’t a common experience!So, do a little reading up, follow my helpful tips and dive in! Location: Cairns, Australia Company: Reef Experience Cost: $185 AUD (approx. $163 USD) Useful Notes: As I mentioned before, I would still recommend this company. The day tour is all-inclusive and includes breakfast, lunch, wine and cheese. There’s also coffee and tea onboard in case you get chilly after surfacing from your dive.Have you been to the Great Barrier Reef?"

The culture is fascinating and truly one of a kind, and of course, it’s all about the beaches!Like so many of the islands dotting the Caribbean Sea, Aruba has a jaw-dropping beauty that people come from every corner of the planet to experience. With blond beaches, turquoise water, and weather that is amazing all year long, this incredible island is well worth the trip.I rented a car during my visit and had such a fun adventure. While it’s a small island (just twenty miles long and six miles across), there’s a lot to explore and experience.The sun-soaked capital, Oranjestad, has a rich history dating back to the eighteenth century as well as some cool modern-day culture. Be sure to check out the Bon Bini Festival on Tuesdays and stick around to dance the night away at some of the city’s hottest nightlife destinations.For those days when you want to do absolutely nothing (yes, please!), the beaches of Aruba are calling.There is an array of beaches for swimming, snorkeling, surfing, and soaking up the sun.

Have a Fresh Caught Lunch at ZeeroversYou’ll definitely not want to miss the lunch at Zeerovers, famous for their whopping platefuls of seafood. Meaning “pirate” in Dutch, Zeerovers serves up fresh seafood straight from the sea, and if you arrive early enough, you’ll find local fisherman bringing in the “catch of the day”.The locals rave about the catch-of-the-day, shrimp and deep-fried reef fish served in a casual, low-key atmosphere.Don’t skimp on the Papaya sauce!While filling up on Zeerover’s perfectly fried barracuda, and the most delicious shrimp you’ve ever had, don’t forget to dip each bite in Papaya hot sauce. It’s the perfect blend of sweet and hot island heat.Be warned, even the mild packs a pretty spicy punch.It was so good, in fact, that we had a few bottles shipped home. Trust us, this stuff is good on just about everything.Work Up an Appetite at Arikok National ParkThe Arikok National Park is home to a diverse wildlife and dramatic landscapes. Established in the 1980s,  you’ll find rock outcroppings, gold mines, caves, ponds and remains of old farms and plantations throughout the park.Keep your ears and eyes out for orioles, burrowing owls, brown-throated parakeets, bats and wild goats. Climb through the picturesque Guadirikiri Cave, and catch glimpses of local reptiles like the cascabel (rattlesnake) and the santanero (cat-eyed snake).After you’re all dusty, you’ll want to clean off by taking a dip in the Natural Pool!The West Deck for Sunset CocktailsThis casual Caribbean restaurant has a large wooden deck set right on the beach. Chill vibes are served alongside traditional food and delicious cocktails.At The West Deck, sip on a mojito-in-a-coconut, and try some other Arubian specialties like fried funchi with Dutch cheese and Trocadero garlic shrimp. Our favorite bites were the Fire & Spice crackling calamari and, surprisingly, their New York cheesecake.Aruba even does dessert well!It’s a perfect place to kick up your sandals, sip on a refreshing cocktail, and watch as the landing planes touch down on Aruba.Dinner IN BED at the Screaming EagleScreaming Eagle blends gourmet dining with–wait for it–dinner in bed.

The wine cellar is also stocked with an impressive selection of over 100 wines and 120 cocktails.Whether you reserve a bed or not, come for the food!Dine on the Beach at Atardi at the Aruba MarriottFor a different restaurant experience, head over to Atardi (formerly called Simply Fish), one of the island’s best-kept secrets.

Savor every bite of rock-lobster tail and roasted sea bass, in the exquisite company of swaying palm trees and bright stars above.Make Your Own Keshi YenaOne of the most traditional foods you can try in Aruba is Keshi Yena. Back at the Aruba Marriott Resort, we got the chance to get our hands dirty in the kitchen learning to make traditional Keshi Yena from scratch.When you think of island destination specialties around the world, you might think of tropical flavor and cool relief from the tropical heat. But that’s not the case with Keshi Yena!Served fresh out of the oven, this cheesy, melty, wholesome dish is a savory spin on island comfort food. Keshi Yena is a reflection of Aruba’s melting pot of culture. Starting with traditional Dutch gouda cheese, you then add just about every ingredient in the kitchen- from olives to raisins to capers to ketchup!The whole thing gets melted together and, despite sounding like a really strange mix of ingredients, it is SO yummy!READ NEXT: Aruba-Inspired Travel Nails"

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-belgium-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Belgium on a Budget,Belgium,"Fascinated by European history? Have a sweet tooth? You will fall head over chocolate-covered-waffles in loooove with Belgium. From the thousands of castles to the vast trails of museums and don’t get me started on the world-class breweries…there is so much culture to explore!While I adore Belgium, it is far from a budget destination. Like many places in Northern Europe, it can get expensive quickly—but it doesn’t have to! A few insider tips will go a long way in helping you stretch your euros.Here are my top tips for visiting Belgium on a budget!    Take Advantage of the Free ThingsLike much of Europe, Belgium has an impressive array of free attractions. In fact, there are more free museums than I could even count. Check out the full list on the official Brussels Museums website to plan your path.In addition to these, all museums are free on the first Wednesday of each month starting at 1 pm. I’d highly recommend getting around to the Museum of Old Masters, Museum of Modern Art, and Musée Magritte.The capital city, Brussels, has some of the most impressive museums on the planet and I would definitely create space in your schedule (and budget) for them. If you aren’t lucky enough to be there on the first Wednesday of the month, a city card can pay off (more on this below!). Get a City  Tourist  CardThroughout Europe, you will find that local tourism offices offer tourist cards for discounted travel, admission, and food. Most places in Belgium offer this card and it’ll give you discounts all over town and it usually includes public transportation!The Brussels Card (available for 24, 48 or 72 hours for €22/29/35 respectively) will get you into museums all over town for free. So this is a great way to see the highlights without spending major bank.Of course, not every place in town participates so plan your day according to where you’ll get deals with your card.Helpful Tip:Even notoriously expensive places like Iceland and Paris offer similar deals. Check out my guides to traveling on a budget in Iceland and the City of Lights. Local  TransportationYou will pay a fortune renting a car or taking a taxi around!To make the most of every euro, you might want to take an overnight bus or train—there tons of options here to get you around the country. The entire country of Belgium has an extensive train network. If you opt for a second class ticket (which is a comfortable option), you can get a ticket to almost anywhere in Belgium for €20 or less.If you are age 26 or under, snag a GoPass Train Pass to venture anywhere in the country for 6.60€.When you book the train, book as early as you can. You can get your ticket online on the official Belgian train site for the best price. Second class tickets sell quickly so you’ll have to pay the first-class rate if you book too late…which is not something you want to do if you’re trying to cut down transportation costs.Flixbus is another great options and you will find tickets starting from 5€.Helpful Tip:As of 2019, the euro and U.S. dollar exchange rate tends to be close in price. One dollar will buy you 89 to 91 cents in euros. So, for every 100 euros you spend, you will see 113 dollars come out of your account.When planning your budget, take into account this conversion rate!   Sample the Street FoodYou just can’t go to Belgium without having fries and waffles!Steer clear of tourist traps and seek out local hotspots. If you walk around the outskirts of the city center, you’ll tend to find better prices and a more authentic experience.Wherever you are in Belgium, it is easy to find waffles for around 1€. Just watch out for the toppings charges—that’s where they get you!Belgium is also known for its incredible chocolate. It can definitely be a splurge if you’re a chocoholic…so if you’re wanting to sample all the delights or bring some confectionary goodies home, make sure to add this to your budget.It’s really easy to spend 100 euros on chocolate. Seriously!   Beautiful Beers of Belgium Read MoreBring on the BeerBelgian beer is renowned throughout the world and for good reason. You could spend a week just trying all of the varieties! Generally speaking, when you go to the bar, you are going to be looking at about 4 euros per glass. If you get a bit out of town, you can find drinks for around 2 euros.If you are a real beer aficionado, you can pick up a good selection of drinks at any grocery store to bring back to your hotel or Airbnb for a self-guided culinary tour. I’d say either way, it’s a win-win. 😉   Don’t Go During Peak SeasonThe busiest time of year in Belgium is from July to August. Tourism is at its peak and the weather is flawless. Most days are in the low 70s so it is dream weather for exploring. However, you will definitely pay a premium for that ideal summer weather.I would actually say that the shoulder season is the best time to go to Belgium—especially when considering the budget.Spring (April to June) and fall (September to October) have lovely weather and fewer crowds. If you are going into the countryside, September to October is an incredible time as the trees turn into a mosaic of colors.Winter is pretty darn cold with average temperatures in the mid-30s and overnight lows dipping well below freezing. But…the Christmas markets make enduring the cold worth it! Bruges and Ghent are truly magical during December. Go On a Free Walking TourRegardless of my budget for any trip, I love free walking tours!They are run by locals who know the area inside out—which is a great way to find hidden gems! You will often find history students working part-time as guides. They know both the history and the local scene so their knowledge is truly priceless.Best of all, these tours operate off of tips so guides tend to give it 100%. If you have a great experience, tip what you think is fair…and you might even make a new friend!   BrugesExplore Local Street  MarketsStreet markets are a prime way to get into the local scene! Wander around and sample the local cuisine while checking out wares from artisans and flipping through unusual antiques.TripAdvisor can be a good place to find the latest listing of markets or just ask a local. Things can change quickly in the world of street markets so it’s always worthwhile to research. Bruxelles Midi Market, for example, in Brussels used to be the place to go but has sadly closed down.

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-spend-24-hours-in-brussels-belgium/,"How to Spend 24 Hours in Brussels, Belgium",Belgium,"This post was written by Sivan, our Student Travel Expert Contributor!Brussels is the beautiful capital city of Belgium. It’s also the capital of comic books, fries, beer, waffles, and of course, chocolate!Walking through the city feels like magic. String lights hang above the cobblestone streets, and the plaza of the Grand-Place is striking.Brussels is a relatively small city, so it’s very possible to see it all in one day.

https://theblondeabroad.com/gentse-feesten-travel-bucketlist/,Why Gentse Feesten Should be on Your Travel Bucketlist,Belgium,"The Gentse Feesten has been around for over 150 years and, with over 2 million annual visitors, is one of the biggest and most popular cultural festivals in Europe.Never heard of it? Keep reading.Gentse Feesten is Flemish for “Ghent Festival” and is held in Ghent, Belgium annually over the course of ten days. It’s no secret that I’m a HUGE fan of Belgium. With incredible beer, delicious treats, beautiful towns and friendly locals, it’s become one of my all-time favorite destinations in the entire world.I first traveled to Ghent a few years ago on a journey to discover the best beers in Belgium and, along with visits to the cities of Bruges and Brussels, I was successful in my mission.This summer I was thrilled to have two of my very best girlfriends from California traveling with me in Europe and I insisted we fly to Belgium so that I could play tour guide.Three blondes abroad in Belgium!We based ourselves in Brussels and used the quick and inexpensive Belgian rail system to take a day trip to Ghent for the Gentse Feesten. Since the last time I had seen Ghent, it had transformed into a completely different city! Buildings were turned into concert venues, stages showcased performers and artists took to the streets.It was absolute madness!While I firmly believe everyone needs to see Ghent outside the dates of the festival for it’s charm and beauty, the city dressed in the excitement of the festival is something to be marveled at.Our day started at a small cafe for some sustenance, a beer (or 2) and a plan. Immediately after being seated, a local dressed as a clown approached our table for a laugh and was greeted by a bit of shock and terror from my friend Chantal.After that experience, I knew it was going to be a fun day.Light lunch and a few Belgian blondesGhent street performer. Chantal wasn’t impressed.We decided the best plan was to lose ourselves in the streets and see what Ghent had in store for us. We stumbled upon many more street performers that ranged from jugglers to musicians. The mood was cheerful and celebratory and we couldn’t help but dance through the town to the beat of our own drum.Jugglers at Gentse FeestenThis old man was the CUTEST!Another goofball entertaining in the streetsThe souvie-stand swag was eco-friendly and made from 100% recycled materials!Charisse stopping for some puppy loveIn my happy place!One of my favorite things about Gentse Feesten was how truly Belgian it felt. It’s not often you have such a massive festival and nearly everyone you meet is actually from the region.I continued my role as tour guide, exploring the city and stopping for photo opps at some of the most famous sites, like the Gravensteen Castle and St. Michael’s bridge.The beautiful waterways in GhentThe GravensteenI took the girls to my favorite chocolate shop in the entire world, Chocolaterie Luc Van Hoorebeke, located just next to the Belfy for one of their crème brûlée chocolate cups.Naturally, we ended up leaving with three bars of chocolate… each.Chocolaterie Luc Van HoorebekeSeriously though… best chocolate in. the. world.Cute little Chocolaterie Luc Van Hoorebeke ice cream truck!We spent the rest of the day partaking in the activities and festivities of the festival. A mojito at the bar across for Polé Polé was a must, as well as another Belgian beer (or 2) at the Duvel tent.People crowding along the river bankMojitos and live music! Don’t mind if I do!Just along the river, the restaurants were completely packed with people visiting for the festival. Luck would have it, a little oyster cart was set up just outside one of the dining establishments for those who preferred to shuck-and-go.It was both of my friends’ first times trying fresh oysters and, while I go weak in the knees for their buttery deliciousness, Chantal and Charisse needed a little coaxing. I’m still not sure if Chantal enjoyed them, but I think Charisse and I could have eaten a dozen to ourselves.Oysters to-go!Om nom nom!Chantal loves trying new things.. haha!We decided to end our visit just after sunset, though I’ve heard that’s when Gentse Feesten really comes to life. During the day, the festival caters to visitors of all ages, with tons of children’s activities and even a “seniors” programme.The packed streets of Ghent as the evening festivities commencedClubs and musical performances carry on until the wee hours of the morning and are meant to be some of the best parties of the year. I was a little sad to have missed it but, as they say, you gotta save something for next time!Ghent at twilightHelpful Tips for Visiting Gentse Feesten Dates: Starts on the Saturday before July 21 (Belgium’s national holiday) and lasts ten days.

https://theblondeabroad.com/beautiful-beers-begium/,The Beautiful Beers of Belgium Guide,Belgium,"I ended up in Belgium (from Fuertevetura in the Canary Islands) after deciding to book my next adventure based on the least expensive flight available. It was one of the best travel decisions I’ve ever made.Oh the joys of spontaneous travel!Between the melt-in-your-mouth chocolate, salty frites, sweet waffles, and world-famous beer selection, it was an easy sell. I planned on spending a week in Belgium between Brussels, Brugge, and Ghent.My main goal? Try as many beers as possible. Little did I know that while I was busy undertaking a food and drink expedition, Belgium would come to be one of my favorite destinations in all of my travels. Let’s begin with a tour through some of my favorite beers, bars, and breweries that I stumbled upon during my stay in Belgium.Brussels, BelgiumI only had a couple of days to spend in Brussels and spent about 85% of my time in The Délirium Café. Literally. I left around 4 am and returned the next day at noon. Then came back that night around 10 pm to repeat the process.The Délirium CaféThere are over 2,000 types of beer at the Délirium Café so, needless to say, I had a hard time convincing myself to leave. The beer-tenders are incredibly knowledgable so it was a great first stop in BelgiumFirst Course: Delirium TremensWhen in Rome… err Brussels… be sure to try a Delirium Tremens. The backstory of this beer alone is reason enough to try it! The delerium tremens (latin for “shaking trembles”) was a phrase used to describe a condition where, as a result of excessive alcohol consumption, one would hallucinate and see pink elephants (hence the pink elephant logo on the beer).Not to worry though! The beer has a whopping 8.5% abv (alcohol by volume) and it was named Best Beer in the World in 2008 (and not for hallucinagenic properties).Second Course: Pucker upOne of my favorite types of beer that I was recently introduced to in my hometown of San Diego… sour beer! They’re tart and refreshing! Oude Geuze is just one type of sour that I tried but I loved it. Don´t be shy, give a sour a try!Third Course: Battle of the CherriesA classic lambic cherry beer cannot be missed. But which one to try? They can range from super sweet to having just the slightest essence of cherry. The price can range just as widely. An authentic cherry beer made with real cherry juice will run you some big bucks, but you don´t need to splurge.There are still plenty of economically friendly cherry beers to indulge in. I tried two of the more popular types and, just as I was told, they tasted completely different. I preferred the Kasteel Rouge because it wasn’t as sweet as Kriek Boon. But, as with all beer, it’s entirely a matter of preference.Dessert: Cookies!Yes, it´s true. Not only is there such a thing as cookie beer but there is also a chocolate beer and plenty of fruit-based beers. The Cookie Beer was served with a traditional Belgian Speculoos cookie. You are supposed to take small bites of the cookie as you sip the beer. Sort of like how you would nibble on chocolate while tasting port wine.And yes, the beer actually tasted like a spice cookie!Blondes on Blondes on Blondes: Tripel BlondesBelgians love blondes! And by that, I mean Tripel Blonde beers like Tripel Karmeliet. They pack some serious strength (some over 10% abv) and, like all blondes, are fantastic! You can find them at every bar but be sure to try this one in particular. It is one of my favorites.Brugge, BelgiumBrugge is like a small village straight out of a Fairytale. But even better than the romantic canals and majestic swans… there’s amazing beer.De Halve Maan BreweryDe Halve Maan is the last remaining family-owned brewery in Bruges. They have a tour for only 6,50€ which includes a beer afterward.All in the Family: Brugse Zot & Straffe HendrickYou will have the opportunity to try the Brugse Zot, a goldenblond beer, after the tour but be sure to try their Straffe Hendrick, a bitter Tripel Ale of 9% abv. Along with the rich history of the brewery (dating back to the 1500s) the Straffe is also the last authentic Tripel Ale of Bruges.Staminee De GarreIt might take a minute, but look hard and you’ll find this little treasure down a small alcove near the Markt. This intimate pub is well worth a visit.One beer two beer three beer floor: Tripel van De GarreThere is a three beer limit on the 11.5% abv Tripel van De Garre. Each glass is served with little bite size pieces of cheese that compliment the beer perfectly. I sipped down two beers far more quickly than I had anticipated and practically fell out of the bar. Enjoy with caution!Charlie Rockets Hostel BarThere’s nothing better than staying at a hostel with a built in bar in Belgium, which is why I stayed at Charlie Rockets. I could get some work done and sip an ice cold Belgian beer all within a few steps of my dorm room.Tried and True: ChimayChimay, while available worldwide, is not only a traditional Belgian beer but also an authentic Trappist beer. That means is it brewed in a monestary under the responsibility of monks. There are a few Chimay beers to mention but I personally prefer Chimay Blue.Ghent, BelgiumWhere to start with Ghent. Personally, Ghent has trumped almost every European city and stands as one of my all-time favorite travel destinations. Between the medieval buildings, the huge jazz music scene and beer gardens galore, I absolutely fell in love with this city!Jazz FestivalsGhent loves jazz. I love jazz. Ghent loves beer. I love beer. We were made for each other. If you time your visit you can go to one of the many jazz fests and see what I mean. Love at first sight.White Delight: Belgian Extra WhitesThere are plenty of Belgian Whites to try, but enjoying a “to-go-sie” during a jazz fest makes it that much better. Grab a Belgian White beer like Vedett and hit the streets for an all Ghent experience.De TrollekelderThis pub sits just across from St. Jacobs church. Trolls look out from the windows onto the city streets and the cozy atmosphere inside is lit by candlelight. It has a very authentic Flemish feel and an impressive offering of beerExclusive Beer: Gulden DraakIn every city there are beers only found in a single bar, or at least just in that city. I’m not sure if the Gulden Draak is available outside of Ghent but it is surely 100% Ghent (and 10.5% abv)! The golden dragon of the beer is symbolic of the same famous dragon statue that sits at the top of the Ghent Belfry (or bell tower).Du Dulle GrietYou’ll find this bar on the cobblestone street of the Vrijdagmarkt. Grab a seat on the front patio or cozy up inside at one of the unique table settings.Overall winner: Tripel KanunnikIf I order the same beer twice, it’s good. Thrice, it’s nice. If I end up staying out all night drinking the same beer, it’s the best. I discovered this little beauty after asking the beer-tender for a recommendation.One of my favorite things about bars in Belgium is that the beer-tenders will fully profile you based on simple answers to their questions about your preference and know exactly which beer you’ll like. The Tripel Kanunnik took the cake!The Grand Finale: A Shoe for a BeerFor the bravest of beer drinkers, order a Bosteel’s Pauwel Kwak at Du Dulle Griet. In exchange for the enormous yard sized beer you need to leave a deposit: one shoe. If that’s not strange enough, your shoe is placed in a wicker basket and hauled up to the top of the rafters.Shoeless and most definitely tipsy after consuming your brew, I’m sure you’ll agree it’s a one-of-a-kind Belgian beer experience not to be missed!This is just a “taste” of what Belgium has to offer. My stay in Belgium, while short, was good to the last drop and has left me longing for more! What’s your favorite Belgian beer?"

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-the-uyuni-salt-flats-in-bolivia/,Visiting the Uyuni Salt Flats in Bolivia,Bolivia,"Easily one of the most beautiful spots on the planet, the Uyuni Salt Flats are spread out over a whopping 4,086 square miles in southwest Bolivia. They are the world’s largest salt flats and well worth the trip.While South America is a great place for backpacking, the Uyuni Salt Flats are the kind of place where you need a tour company. Since it’s such a massive area, you’ll want to have somebody with a 4×4 truck who knows how to get around. To maximize your time in Bolivia, it’s essential to come prepared…here’s everything you need to know about visiting the Uyuni Salt Flats! Getting ThereYou can start your trip in Uyuni, Tupiza, or San Pedro de Atacama. Ultimately, the best route depends on where you are staying and how much time you can spend on the tour.The majority of international flights will arrive at La Paz or Santa Cruz. From either city, you can fly into Uyuni or take the bus. I was staying in Sucre and took the bus to Tupiza to start my tour. The tour can also be done in reverse starting in Uyuni.Be sure to read up on the details of my 4-day 4×4 tour to Uyuni: Part 1 & Part 2 Bolivia is bigger than it might look on the map. The country is about the size of California and Texas combined so you’ll want to map everything out to have a clear picture of how long it’ll take to get around.Picking a Tour CompanyNot all Uyuni Salt Flats tour companies are equal. Actually, some of them are a bit scary. I’ve heard horror stories of a surprisingly high number of travelers getting stuck in the middle of the flats with a drunk driver. Generally speaking, you get what you pay for. I wouldn’t recommend going for rock bottom prices, and you’ll definitely want to read some reviews before booking.I used Tupiza Tours and had a great experience. The tour guides were friendly and knowledgeable. The group offers an incredible four-day tour either to or from Uyuni that will take you through all of the best spots.What to ExpectThis isn’t a five-star experience. None of the tours are very comfortable or luxurious, and the trip out to the salt flats it long. That said, you’ll forget about every bump and hassle when you see the view.The Uyuni Salt Flats are completely surreal, and you will have an AMAZING time.You 100% want to get to the Uyuni Salt Flats before sunrise and most tours plan to leave well before the sun comes up. You’ll be able to snap some amazing pics as the sun rises over the land. The very first light of day is the best opportunity to get photos without any shadows.Most tour operators set up far enough apart from one another so that all you see in every direction is an endless blanket of white.During certain times of year when there is rain, the sky reflects in the puddles and creates an incredible display.Our tour guides brought coffee and tea and breakfast in our cars so that we could enjoy the salt flats for a few hours before heading back to town. What to BringUyuni has a wet season, from November to March, and a dry season, from May to October. If you travel during the winter, which is from May to August, expect cold weather. It’s not unusual to see weather barely above zero on the coldest nights; be sure to bring layers at any time of year.Lots of layers!There are hot springs along the salt flats tours, so you’ll also want to pack a bikini, towel, and some flip flops.While many tour companies offer meals, might want to bring your own snacks and drinks. It’s also advisable to bring along one two-liter bottle of water per person per day to stay hydrated!Most of the bathrooms are paid toilets, so bring plenty of small change and some extra TP.It can get very dark at night, and some of the more basic accommodations turn off their lights at night, so bring a flashlight or headlamp.Bring all of your photography gear! This is easily one of the best photo ops on earth, so don’t settle for phone photos. Grab your tripod, lenses, and camera to get photos that you can treasure for a lifetime.The Uyuni Train CemeteryAside from the salt flats, Uyuni is also home to a cool train cemetery playground. The metal is rusted (so be careful not to cut yourself!), but you can visit and swing, seesaw and slide your way through an old, abandoned train!Another Helpful TipAltitude sickness is a very real thing in Bolivia. If you are coming in from the coast, you will want to plan on a few days to adjust.While it might take some extra planning, it’s best to spend time gradually increasing your elevation. Jumping up too high too quickly can leave you feeling miserable with flu-like symptoms.The good news is that there are endless impressive sites to see on the way up. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/pink-flamingos-aguas-calientes/,Pink Flamingos at Aguas Calientes,Bolivia,"Aguas Calientes, BoliviaA four day 4×4 tour with Tupiza Tours in Bolivia brought me to some of the most incredible natural beauty I have ever seen.At what quite possiby might be the world’s best road stop, we arrived at Aguas Calientes. These natural hot springs were perfectly heated by natural volcanic activity and there was a perfect view to match! The hot springs opened up to crystal blue waters inhabited by pink flamingos and a horizon of snow capped volcanoes.Read more about my 4×4 tour in Bolivia!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/lets-discovery-channel-salt-edition-part-2/,Uyuni Salt Flats Tour (Part 2),Bolivia,"After spending the last two days on the Uyuni Salt Flats tour, I literally couldn’t imagine what else was in store for us. Be sure you read my last post on Days 1 & 2 of the tour as we leave Tupiza and get up close and personal with pink flamingos, natural hot springs and volcanic geysers!Day 3 of our tour was action-packed and on Day 4, we beat the sun to the Salar de Uyuni: the world’s largest salt flats!Starting the day off at Laguna ColoradaDay 3: Stone Trees and Black Lagoons!Our third day on the road started off with pancakes, dulce de leche and an incredible view at an alternate lookout point of Laguna Colorada. My kind of morning! The pink flamingos were getting their day started early too! We took our time watching the sun creep up over the distant mountains as we prepared ourselves for the long day ahead!“Bouldering” at Arbol de Piedra (Stone Tree)It was another long day on the dusty roads of Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa. We were definitely more prepared for the journey after spending plenty of time in our 4×4 over the past two days.Our next stop was at Valle de Rocas which is home to the famous Arbol de Piedra or Stone Tree. We climbed, jumped and crawled our way along the massive rock formations. They are pretty unbelievable and almost seem to be placed there in the middle of the desert. I suspect… aliens.Incredible reflection!Our timely and strategic guide, David, was on a mission this morning to get us to Uyuni tonight so we revised the itinerary ever so slightly. We would normally have stopped along a series of small lagoons including Laguna Hedionda, Chiarcota, Ramaditas, Honda and Cañapa. Instead, we set full speed ahead into the dusty distance!At least I was able to snap some quick photos along the drive!A long day of driving!Normally we would have driven north to the base of the Uyuni Salt Flats and spent the night at a salt hotel in Chuvica, but because of recent rain, the roads were in poor condition. Instead, we took an alternate route heading east towards Uyuni.We stopped for lunch at our last lagoon, Laguna Negra, where the water is almost black due to the igneous rock from volcanic eruptions.After getting back on the road, we had a minor breakdown (to be expected!), but our handy driver had everything fixed in no time. We made it to Uyuni just before nightfall and turned in early so that we could be up to watch the sun rise at the salt flats in the morning!Stopping for lunch at the Black LagoonWe beat the sun to the Salt Flats!Day 4: The Uyuni Salt FlatsWe started our day heading west in the pitch black of the early morning towards the Uyuni Salt Flats. I literally couldn’t tell where we had ended up until the sun slowly set itself on the vast salty Salar and I realized, unmistakably, that we had arrived at the world’s largest salt flats.There was salt as far as the eye could see!I’m not a morning personWe got about 30 minutes of low light with no shadows just as the sun began to rise and took advantage of the photo opportunity. Breakfast of cake and coffee was then served and I was most appreciative. Things just don’t work right for me before 6 am. After caffiene-ating and carbo-loading we got to work on our funny salt flats photos!Fun with optical illusions!I know everyone does it, and it’s oh so touristy and lame, but we had a BLAST taking hilarious optical illusion shots of ourselves guzzling entire bottles of wine and shrinking down to the size of a toy rickshaw. Don’t be a downer… get weird and have a little fun!The Salt Hotel (Yes those are bricks made from SALT!)After a long morning on the salt flats we made a quick stop at the famous Salt Hotel. It’s basically just as it says… a Salt Hotel. The hotel itself, along with all of the furniture and even the floors, is entirely made of salt!According to our guide it has a ridiculous waiting list for reservations and costs somewhere around $100 a night to stay there! I settled for a peak in the window and was pretty much over it.SO amazing! Rain water on the Salt Flats!We made it back to Uyuni for lunch and as we drove through the last bit of the salt flats we hit rain water. We had heard from fellow travelers that the flats are especially beautiful after the rain and WOW were they right! The salt reflected off the pools of water as the wind blew across the surface rippling the reflections. It looked absolutely unreal!The Uyuni Train CemetaryAfter lunch we drove just outside the city to the Cementerio de Trenes (Train Cemetery). It was a ghost town of rusted train carcasses that had once been steam trains. There are parts of the train that have been turned into playground equipment like swings and see-saws so I took full advantage of unleashing my inner child.Playing on the old trainsWe got dropped off after our last day on the tour and said sad goodbyes to our guides. It was by far the best tour (and tour group) I have ever experienced in all of my travels! The only thing left to do in Uyuni (literally) was see what the famous Minuteman Pizza, located inside the Toñito Hotel, was all about.As soon as we walked in, the place was PACKED with tourists and we were ready to walk right back out… until I smelled the garlic bread! We grabbed a pesto pizza and an ice-cold beer and “cheers”ed to a tour well done!The best pizza in Uyuni!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/discovery-channel-salt-edition-part-1/,Uyuni Salt Flats Tour (Part 1),Bolivia,"Here’s the first part of the tale of an amazing and unforgettable 4 day journey ending at the world’s largest salt flat in Uyuni, Bolivia!First piece of advice: Call or email a tour company to check on making a reservation for the Uyuni Salt Flats Tour ahead of time! Gareth and I were relaxing at a cafe in Sucre when we made a minor, shall I say, mis-assumption that we could take a night bus down to Uyuni that night from Sucre. Not possible. There are only morning buses!That would mean we would have to leave the following day, with an entire wasted day on a bus and an entire day missed of the tour! Instead, we were instructed to take an early afternoon bus to Potosi and then get a night bus from there down to Uyuni.UPDATE: A reader has informed me that there are now night buses directly to Uyuni. I started my tour in Tupiza, which I highly recommend, but you can also start in Uyuni with another company.Once we arrived in Potosi, after a longer than expected bus from Sucre (surprise surprise!), we found that there were only buses to TUPIZA, not Uyuni. Both Gareth and I try to plan as little as possible, go with the flow so to speak, and we hadn’t even heard of Tupiza. Luckily there is a lovely bus terminal in Potosi with decent WiFi, and we discovered that Tupiza Tours came highly recommended and we booked our night bus to Tupiza.Making plans at the bus terminal in PotosiWe arrived in Tupiza before sunrise and started the scavenger hunt of finding Tupiza Tours. Why would we bother writing down the address or phone number while in Potosi? That would make things too easy. It turns out the office is located nearby in The Mitru Hotel. After grabbing breakfast at the hotel and waiting for the office to open, we pulled a classic travel move and washed up in the bathroom in hopes to begin our first day on the tour.The office opened and we were informed that all tours for the day were full. WHAT?! It was Thursday, we had planned on taking the 4 day tour and I was flying home on Wednesday. After being informed that we could get on the tour the next day, I realized I would literally finish the tour and get back to Sucre the day before I flew home out of La Paz. It was taking a HUGE chance considering the fallible transportation system in Bolivia, but I couldn’t miss this once in a lifetime opportunity.Our tours were booked!Four days of traveling through the most beautiful scenery in Bolivia (transport, food and accommodation included) all for around 1300 B’s or just under $200.So my advice is to call ahead, DEFINITELY go with Tupiza Tours (read on and you’ll know why!), and write down helpful information like the office phone number and address. The obvious stuff.Quebrada de PalalaDay 1: Welcome to the Wild Wild West!Our first day of the tour started off early and our 4×4 was also stocked with fellow travelers, Paul and Jen, as well as our driver and cook, David and Agostina. We set off in a caravan of 3 Tupiza Tour jeeps headed out into the unknown… well sort of. We had a little illustrated map. The landscape quickly transformed from the small city of Tupiza into a picturesque image of the Wild Wild West, complete with towering red rock formations and dry brush-lined desert.The view as we drive away from TupizaI had heard horror stories of travelers getting stuck with drunk drivers and as I watched our driver crack open a cold one along a sharp turn of a canyon my stomach sank. I quickly realized it was a non-alcoholic malt energy beverage that’s popular in Bolivia and got my bearings back. Our day was long, stretching for miles upon miles of vast desert with quick stops to enjoy lunch with the llamas and a few potty breaks.Fasten your seat belts! It’s gonna be a WILD ride!We arrived at 4200 meters in San Antonio, our destination for that night’s sleep, and collectively decided as a group to press on! We drove another three hours, made a quick stop at the ruins of Puebla Fantasma and then watched the sun set behind the beautiful snow capped mountains.The ruins at Puebla FantasmaAs informed beforehand by the tour company, we would need to pay 150 B’s to enter the Reserva Nacional de Fauna Andina Eduardo Avaroa, so we made a quick stop to pay for our entry. Shortly after entering the National Park, we found refuge at our hotel. It was after 10 pm when we finally sat down for a delicious and seriously appreciated dinner. A VERY long first day totaling in over 10 hours!Watching the sun set after a long dayLlama love!Day 2: Overstimulated by Amazing!Because we decided to take more time driving yesterday we were able to get some extra shut-eye and had an easy start around 7 am. We had surprisingly comfortable beds and I slept like a baby! I admittedly have a mild obsession with llamas. They’re like living anime cartoon creatures.We stopped at a local farm where they had TONS of them gated up before being released to graze for the day. After getting my llama fix we passed a few lagoons and had our first sighting of beautiful pink flamingos before reaching Laguna Verde.What? This old thing? Laguna VerdeLaguna Verde was absolutely breathtaking. The turquoise lagoon sits at the base of an inactive snowcapped volcano. It’s like a true oasis in the middle of a barren desert. This was the first stop on our trip where the wind started to pick up which made things a bit chilly!We got back on the road and backtracked towards Aguas Calientes. On our way, we passed the surreal Desierto de Dali. The desert is sprinkled with giant boulders and looks much like something out of the magnificently twisted mind of famed artist Salvador Dali.Definitely a Desierto Dali!We arrived at Aguas Calientes just before lunchtime and jumped right into the natural hot springs. The water was perfectly heated by natural volcanic activity and their was a perfect view to match!The hot springs opened up to crystal blue waters inhabited by pink flamingos and snow capped volcanoes. I think this might be the world’s best road stop! After our skin began to wrinkle we hesitantly decided to say so long to the incredible hot springs.Bath with a view!It wasn’t far until we reached the Geisers “Sol de Mañana” and I was literally blown away! The winds really picked up here and blew the smell of sulfur into our car before we even caught sight of the geysers. Smoke was billowing up through tons of crater-like formations in the ground from the intense volcanic activity.I had a blast taking photos with nature’s very own fog machine. Once the smell of rotten eggs started to get a bit overwhelming we, yet again, hit the road!Absolutely breathtaking view at the Hot SpringsIf I hadn’t already seen some of the most incredible natural sights in my life on this trip already… we arrived at Laguna Colorada. The lagoon is a brilliant red color resulting from pigments of algae and thin sediment deposits. The flamingos absorb the color through their diets here and that’s how flamingos get their beautiful pink color!Getting blown away at the geysers!I’ve seen some of the most beautiful places in the world and was hardly expecting half of what I experienced in just two days on the Uyuni Salt Flats tour in Bolivia. We still had two more days of the tour and I was literally left speechless from the past 48 hours. Mother Nature you are one sexy lady!Where flamingos get their pink on!CONTINUE TO PART 2 OF THE TOUR >"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-village-of-morado-kasa/,The Pueblo of Morado K’asa,Bolivia,"In a small pueblo in the Bolivia, there are smiles of all shapes and sizes, the natives speak Quechua (which only comes in one volume-LOUD) and there is a never-ending supply of carbs and red onions.After a two-hour bus ride southeast from Sucre, you will find the small village of Morado K’asa. The stone streets are bustling with all kinds of life including pigs, chickens, donkeys, street dogs, sheep and children. There are a few small shops for basic needs but, for the most part, Morado K’asa is a simple and self-sustained community of men that work hard on the farm and women that tend to the animals, children and the home.Peaches drying outside the houseMy friend Gareth has been visiting this village every week for the last two months to help an organization called Biblioworks. They run the small library in the community. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to come out to the village and help two weeks in a row. Our visits were hosted by a family in the village that gave us a bed in a small concrete room and HUGE meals in return for just a few dollars a day.Recycling bottles into art containersThe family home is run by Jostina and the help of her young daughter, Nicole, and niece, Carolina. I’ve never seen little girls with such independence and responsibility for their family. The oldest daughter is very busy. Between sports and school , she leaves every morning at 5 am to make time for all of her activities. The youngest son, Nelson, helps dad out on the farm and lends a hand around the home when needed. Dad, Don Teadoro, spends every hour of daylight on the farm harvesting and planting new crops.Helping out at the BiblioWorks libraryAfter arriving in Morado K’asa, in the late afternoon on our first day, we were greeted with big hugs and smiles from all of the children in the family home. We took a minute to get settled in our guest room before walking to the library to open it for the evening. Kids slowly trickled in, each with a different agenda. The library is adequately stocked with drawing supplies and books of all kinds. Each child greeted us by name, or gave us a shy smile, before busying themselves with homework or a book.Fresh baked bread anyone?While the kids worked away, Gareth and I came up with some projects of our own. There isn’t exactly a waste management system in the village, let along a recycling program, so we decided to reuse some plastic bottles to organize the art supplies.The library usually fills up by 7 pm so, to keep the kids focused, Gareth planned an activity for the kids to use their imagination. We asked questions like “What do you want to be when you grow up?” and “Where would you want to live in the world?” The kids rummaged through magazines and world atlases to help them envision far away lands and a future of “anything is possible.”Walking to the farmOn our second day in Morado K’asa, Gareth and I walked to the nearest town, Cororo, to enjoy the beautiful countryside on a perfect sunny day. Fields of wheat and corn stretch as far as the eye can see and meet bright blue skies with big puffy white clouds. After our quick visit to Cororo, we returned to the family home to find Jostina preparing a whole lotta pan (bread)!We got to get our hands dirty and helped knead the dough before letting it rise for the rest of the afternoon.Nelson helping us pick peachesAfter getting our fill of lunch, we took a walk with Nelson to bring Don Teadoro his lunch on the farm. We got a full tour of the crops… everything from squash to potatoes to corn to peach trees. We grabbed a few peaches off the trees and hung out in the shade with the farm animals. That evening we spent a few hours helping out at the library again and hopped the bus back to Sucre the next morning.Life out on the farmPlaces like Morado K’asa are a wonderful reminder that quality of life isn’t dependent on fame or fortune. Happiness is truly manifested through the people that surround us and our love for life, regardless of our personal success.It’s these simple experiences in travel that I hold dearest."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-proyecto-horizonte-in-ushpa-ushpa-bolivia/,Visiting Proyecto Horizonte in Bolivia,Bolivia,"To say that Proyecto Horizonte is an incredible organization would be an understatement. The massive collaborative effort in Cochabamaba, Bolivia seriously blew me away!I was introduced to the organization after meeting the CEO of a partner organization, The Orphaned Starfish, at the Sundance Film Festival. I was excited for the opportunity to visit another organization during my time in Bolivia. After spending a weekend in La Paz, we took a night bus down to Cochabamba where we would be spending a few days in the community of Ushpa Ushpa helping with Proyecto Horizonte.Proyecto HorizonteProyecto Horizonte – Ushpa Ushpa was founded in 2004 to build a day care center for children. The project grew to include a health care center and a school. Today there are 150 children between the ages of 1 to 6 years attending the 5 levels of the “Education Initial,” and a daycare program. A recently inaugurated school has 600 children between the ages of 6 to 14 years in attendance. During the evening hours, a school program for adults is also provided.The Preschoolers taking a break from classOn top of the school, daycare center, and medical center, Proyecto Horizonte collaborates with The Orphaned Starfish, who built a computer center at the school, and also with Save The Children, who provides the curriculum for the computer classes and the training of the teachers.Class Photo!Our time in Ushpa Ushpa was short, but we were able to help in a big way! The daycare center was in dire need of a plumbing system to provide running water to the bathroom sinks. I’m no stranger to water projects after working with Global Water Brigades in Honduras and was up for the challenge.The Building CrewGareth and I got to work cutting PVC pipes and fitting the pipe maze together to create a functioning system for sink faucets in the children’s bathrooms. On our third and last day with Proyecto Horizonte, we had completed both sink faucet systems in the girls and boys restrooms and helped start a new project to build a water purification system.A little one on one footyballIt was incredible how all of the pieces of the puzzle fit together with the collaboration of so many organizations to bridge the gap between education, healthcare, and community development.

https://theblondeabroad.com/cycling-the-death-road/,Cycling the World’s Deadliest Road,Bolivia,"When I was in Bolivia back in 2012, I decided it would be a great experience to cycle “The Death Road”. I definitely didn’t know what to expect or what was in store, but I knew it was an adventure I wanted to have.Here’s my experience cycling the world’s deadliest road in Bolivia!First Things FirstAt 6am, my friend, Gareth, and I arrived at the Madness Biking office in La Paz, Bolivia. I still couldn’t wrap my head around what exactly the day had in store for us and the butterflies in my stomach had quickly become heavy rocks.We had planned on taking the cycling tour even before I arrived in Bolivia and I was SO nervous!The Death Road is known as The World’s Most Dangerous Road for claiming the lives of over 18 cyclists as well as hundreds of lives in automobile accidents each year. That was the only information I had before committing to the 64 km cycle tour.What was I thinking?!The fear sinking in!Cycling the Death RoadWe changed into our cycle gear and got a quick rundown on the do’s and don’t’s of cycling down the Death Road before boarding a bus that would take us to our starting point at La Cumbre at 4,640 meters high up in the mountains. The starting point seemed innocent enough with paved roads and a somewhat mild downhill slope.GoPro – Check!We cycled for about 20 minutes until we reached an absolutely breathtaking scenic lookout where you could see the road stretching out for an eternity. This is when reality began to sink in! I had a full day of unknown ahead of me and things hadn’t even gotten dangerous.Ready, set, CYCLE!After cycling for almost an hour we reached the beginning of the actual Death Road and said goodbye to smooth paved roads and said hello to a dirt road with loose gravel and deadly drop offs.The road was entirely downhill so you never let off the brakes because you felt like you were going too fast but also felt like hitting the brakes too hard would send you tumbling forward head first.Between the intermittent rain, the loose gravel, and the cliff edge to my left, the danger was now very real.In remembrance of the lives lost on The Death RoadAt some points the road was so narrow only one bike could cross at a time and it seemed impossible that a bus, let alone a car, could ever consider driving the road.All along the road there were crosses in remembrance of the lives lost along the road and, with the hazy mist surrounding us, it was unbelievably eerie.One of the famous deadly turnsThe whole trip led us down 3,345 meters of vertical descent past dangerous turns and even straight through a waterfall!By the end I was exhausted, had more than a few bug bites, and could hardly move my arms.I had overcome a massive personal challenge and faced my fear of heights and conquered The World’s Most Dangerous Road!We did it! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-time-to-travel-to-brazil/,The Best Time to Travel to Brazil,Brazil,"Brazil is truly a year-round destination. Because of its tropical location, the weather is warm throughout the year, making it an ideal place to escape the cold (though keep in mind it does have several climatic extremes!).When it comes down to planning a trip to Brazil, figuring out the best time to visit all depends on the activities you have in mind and what you’re looking to do.To make things a little easier, this guide will help you decide the best time to visit Brazil!   September to OctoberSeptember marks the beginning of spring in Brazil. Although spring is considered the low season, the temperature is warm and pleasant. This goes for the seawater too, making it a great time to visit Brazil’s tropical beaches.It’s also one of the best times to visit the Pantanal—an enormous area of seasonally flooded savannahs and drylands.This is arguably one of the best places in the world to see wildlife and spring is the time to do so. Come the end of October, you might face some rainfall so if you’re looking to squeeze in a trip to the Amazon, you’ll want to do this beforehand.Because these months are considered the low season, you won’t find the music or activities in comparison to other months. This is ideal for those looking for some peace and quiet and lower price tags.November to MarchAhh yes, summertime. Like many other places, summer in Brazil means pretty hot daily temperatures. This makes these months one of the best times to visit the beaches and spots like Rio and Sao Paolo.If you’re trying to travel to Brazil on a budget but also want to experience the sun, make your way in November rather than the later months.December is the start of the high season. Visitors from all over the world flock to Rio de Janeiro to escape the cold. Christmas and New Year’s are particularly busy as people gather to experience Rio dressed in white as the fireworks go off over the Copacabana Beach.After Christmas, tourism does drop off a bit in January but picks right back up in February (or March depending on the year) with the celebration of Carnival. The most famous celebrations take place in Rio where you will find colorful samba parades and street parties.  Christ the Redeemer, Rio de JaneiroApril to MayFall in Brazil means beautiful weather as the warm temperatures of summer begin to cool down. The crowds of travelers that visited during the summer months have left, making it less crowded and more affordable.Visit spots like Iguazu Falls during these months to avoid crowds and the sticky humidity that comes from the rains that happen from December to February.Easter, also known as Semana Santa, is celebrated in Minas Gerais with the cobbled streets covered carpets of flowers and other natural materials.  June to AugustBecause Brazil is tropical, it does not get a true “winter.” Temperatures do drop and it might get a bit chilly in the evenings, but you’re still met with the warmth of the sunshine.These months are a lovely time to visit the Green Coast between Rio and Sao Paolo. You might run into some rain showers, however, it is easy to plan your day around the one or two showers that briefly arrive in the afternoon.If you want to explore the great big Amazon, you’re more likely to see ocelots, pumas, jaguars, monkeys, and sloths during these months.OverallGenerally speaking, Brazil has two major seasons: the dry season from March to November and the wet season from December to January.Regardless of when you choose to visit, you’ll be able to enjoy Brazil’s golden coasts, warm crystal waters, and abundance of wildlife.Have you been to Brazil before? What time of the year did you go? "
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-rio-in-a-weekend/,The Ultimate Guide to Rio in a Weekend,Brazil,"Rio is truly a magical city; known for its Copacabana and Ipanema beaches, the Christ the Redeemer statue atop Mt. Corcovado, Sugarloaf Mountain, and its Carnival festival, the seaside city is lively, to say the least!I didn’t get to spend too much time in Rio after ending my Brazilian Holiday with Crystal Cruises, and the time that I did get to spend there was met with gloomy weather. While I’m counting down the days until I can return, I’ve compiled a guide based off the things I loved, and suggestions I got from readers all over the world.Don’t miss the ultimate guide to Rio in a weekend!– Stay at Hotel Fasano Rio de Janeiro –Hotel Fasano is located in the heart of it all, smack-dab on Avenida Vieira Souto on Ipanema Beach. A sophisticated hotel in the city’s most charming neighborhood, Hotel Fasano is both classy and modern, with a touch of nostalgia from the Bossa Nova era of the 1950s.You can enjoy evening meals at the Fasano al Mare or take a dip in the infinity pool while sipping a cocktail. The hotel is just steps away from both the beach and Leblon where there’s an endless supply of cafes, restaurants, bars, and shops.– Visit Christ the Redeemer –Christ the Redeemer is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Built in 1931 on Mt. Corcovado’s peak, it’s become the cultural icon for both Rio and Brazil.The best time to check out the statue is before 10:00 a.m. so hop in a taxi and avoid the lines and crowds. Have the driver drop you at the bottom, if you want to save some money, because rides to the top are more expensive.You have the option to take the tram up the mountain to Cristo. If the line is too long, take one of the vans that offers group rides to the last stop before taking an official van to the top!Either way, you will need to take one of the official vans for the final leg to Cristo Redentor. There’s a nice and inexpensive cafe at the top, which offers snacks and drinks!Helpful Tip: The tram does accept credit cards, but the vans do require cash—so make sure to have some handy!(source)– Enjoy a Cafezinho –The cafezinho (little espresso) is a popular welcome drink in Brazil that is often imbibed at work, at home, and at sophisticated boutiques.The minute you walk through any door, don’t be surprised if someone asks you “você quer um cafezinho?”…when in Rome!Do as the Brazilians do and pair a cafezinho with a pão de queijo (cheese bread). A highly recommend café in Leblon is called Cafeína, so be sure to check that out!(source)– Caipirinha! –The Caipirinha is Brazil’s national cocktail. Cachaça, hard liquor distilled from sugarcane, is blended with sugar and lime to create the masterful and succulent Caipirinha.By some accounts it was first created to combat the Spanish flu, and the name originates from the word caipira, or “hillbilly.”(source)– Explore Sugar Loaf –The Sugar Loaf Cable Car will take you from Praia Vermelha to Sugarloaf Mountain. It reaches the summit of 1,300 feet with a stop at Morro da Urca along the way.Opened in 1912, the Sugar Loaf Cable Car has been in continual use and was even the site for the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker. The cars run every 30 minutes and have a total of 2,500 visitors each day—so come early to avoid the lines!At the Urca station, you’ll find a credit card-friendly cafe, snack bar, and restaurant as well as some souvenir stands and a children’s area.(source)– Explore the Neighborhoods –Rio is home to various colorful and distinct neighborhoods. It’s nearly impossible to explore them all. The city is divided into three zones—the Zona Norte, the older Centro, and the beach-lined Zona Sul. Take a few days to check out funky, picturesque Lapa, the bohemian Santa Teresa, music– and movie-laden Botafogo, or the trendy Leblon.In the North, you’ll find a few monuments of note, like the Rio Zoo, the National Museum of Brazil, and the National Observatory. In the Center, you’ll find historic churches, monuments, and squares at the city’s old waterfront.The south tells the story of Rio’s transition into a new, high-rise metropolis. Always end the day in the Zona Sul, home to many of Rio’s upscale neighborhoods and the bulk of its famous beaches, including Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon.(source)– Hit the Waves –Rio’s beaches are world-renowned for their clean, soft sand and their convenient accessibility from most hotels and hostels. Along the beach you’ll also find a plethora of rental tents and chairs, wet trails, free showers, and bars and cafes.Soak in the sun at Copacabana and Ipanema, the more popular of the beaches.You can practice your surfing skills or down a sanduíche natural, a cold sandwich with vegetables and mayo. Prefer to avoid the crowd? Opt for Leblon, the quieter, but equally beautiful sister beach.– Snack on an Açai Bowl on the Beach –A favorite lunch on the beach is the Açaí bowl. Açaí, a purple, iron- and antioxidant-rich berry is usually blended with honey, granola, bananas, and guaraná (a natural Amazonian relative of caffeine) to make a refreshing, über-Brazilian treat.And there’s no better bowl than what you’ll find at Polis Sucos. This little eatery’s Ipanema location makes it popular with locals and tourists alike. Arrive early to grab your fresh fruit juice, smoothie, or açaí blend.– Photo Opp in the Botanical Gardens –The Jardim Botanico is a great place to take your camera. The garden is huge and has hundreds of plants from all over the world.Founded in 1808, the gardens now house around 6,500 species, including orchids, cacti, and carnivorous plants. You’ll spot a lot of animals too—squirrels, monkeys, hummingbirds, toucans, and marmosets, just to name a few.(source)– Live it Up in Lapa –Lapa is an excellent nightlife district. It was once a seedy area of crime and dive bars but after an influx of nightclubs and hip hangouts, Lapa has revamped into Rio’s most fun option for nightlife.Located in Rio’s historic center, it’s become a favorite locale for many clubbers dancing the night away. Head over to Lapa and pretty soon you’ll find that you danced the night away!READ NEXT: Where to Travel While the US Dollar is Strong Read MoreThe Best Time to Visit BrazilThe Beginner’s Guide to Backpacking South AmericaTen Reasons to Get Travel Insurance for your Next TripHighlights from my Holiday Cruise with Crystal Cruises10 Safest Destinations for Solo Female Travelers SHOP my favorite Rio-inspired styles!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){vare,p;if(!doc.getElementById(id)){e=doc.createElement(s);e.id=id;p='//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js';varcb=newDate().getTime();p+='?cb='+cb;e.src=p;doc.body.appendChild(e);}if(typeofwindow.ss_shopsense==='object'){if(doc.readyState==='complete'){window.ss_shopsense.init();}}}(document,'script','shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-getting-a-visa-for-brazil-in-los-angeles/,Tips for Getting a Visa for Brazil in Los Angeles,Brazil,"NOTE: As of June 17, 2019, US Citizens no longer require a tourist visa for Brazil!Bursting with white-sand beaches, tropical islands, thrilling nightlife and the fascinating Amazon rainforest, it’s no wonder Brazil is high on most travelers’ bucket lists.And with the 2016 Olympics set for Rio de Janeiro, travelers now more than ever will be heading to the fun-loving beaches of this Latino country! But for US citizens, and especially Angelenos, getting there is no picnic.Applying for the Brazilian visa is a process that can take a lot of time, money and hassle. My own journey to obtain a Brazil visa was nothing short of a nightmare.Here are my tips on getting a Visa for Brazil in Los Angeles!Obtain Your Visa Well in AdvanceNo, visas can’t be obtained at the airport. The process for getting a visa in LA is to book an appointment online (availability may not be for 2-3 months out), take your passport to the appointment, then leave your passport and wait 2-3 weeks for them to process your visa. In the meantime, you can’t really do any other international travel because you are sans passport. There are only 10 consulates in the U.S.A. and you must submit your application to the one that has jurisdiction over your state of residence. For Southern California residents, it’s Los Angeles. For other US residents, click here to find out which consulate is yours!Emphasis on ‘Well in Advance’The process can take weeks or even months. The consulates in Los Angeles and San Francisco in particular get swamped with applications, as they cover eleven different states between them. You will need at least 3-4 months advance to apply which, let’s be honest, few of us have when planning a big trip! So, be prepared or consider getting assistance with a visa agency.Use a Trusted Visa AgencyWhen I went to schedule an appointment using the Brazil consulate’s online scheduler (one month before my trip) there weren’t any appointments available until the month after I was scheduled to return home from Brazil.You may encounter this same scenario and will need to use a visa handler as a liaison may ease the application process.Option (and my HIGH recommendation): use MyBrazilVisa.com. They’re an agency based out of Beverly Hills, so have direct access to the Los Angeles Consulate. I overnighted my mom’s and my passport to MyBrazilVisa.com and they were able to get our passports into the consulate the next day. They have a special relationship with the consulate and are able to skip the appointment scheduling process. While they eased the appointment process, keep in mind that you will still need to wait the 2-3 weeks processing time.This isn’t a sponsored post, I just had such an amazing experience with them that I want everyone to know about it.Submit All Your DocumentsIf you are using an agency to get your visa, make sure to submit your documents all at once. There is a long list of items you need to submit to obtain the visa directly from the consulate- so be sure to do your research and see which documents you need.Again—send in the documents well in advance. Even with a visa handler, the processing time is still normal. So you will need at LEAST 1 month to ensure you get everything processed and back to you in time!…but it’s not over!Once you arrive at the Brazilian airport, you must fill out an immigration form on arrival. Don’t lose this form—you’ll need it when you exit Brazil. Failed to get one on entry? Pay a hefty fine. But good news! Once you arrive in Brazil, you’ll see how much it was worth it. You can see what makes Brazil so special in these posts: My New Years Eve in Rio de Janeiro and Things to See & Do at the World Cup in Brazil."
https://theblondeabroad.com/highlights-from-my-holiday-cruise-with-crystal-cruises/,Highlights from my Holiday Cruise with Crystal Cruises,Brazil,"I recently returned from my first ever cruise with Crystal Cruises where I celebrated Christmas on board and rang in the New Year off Copacabana Beach in Rio. It was one of the most incredible experiences in my travels – especially since I got to share the cruise with my mom!Here are some of the highlights from my Holiday Cruise with Crystal Cruises!Celebrating the Holidays On BoardWithout a doubt, one of the most memorable experiences on board Crystal Cruises’ Crystal Symphony was getting to spend Christmas at sea.The entire celebration was filled with holiday cheer and delicious food. I’ve never seen a Christmas spread so extravagant! Ice sculptures and giant gingerbread houses decorated the ship and we filled our bellies with a holiday feast.Read more about Christmas at sea on the Crystal Cruises Blog!Speaking of Food…The best thing about my cruise on Crystal Cruises was the food. I still dream about it. There are two specialty restaurants on board Crystal Symphony: The Silk Road and Prego. We ate at The Silk Road four times during our cruise! Imagine all you can eat Nobu sushi and asian food. It was heaven!In the dining room, the dinner menu changes EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I have no idea how they manage to reimagine a two page menu with options like slow-cooked, shiraz-braised, oxtail ragout and gnocchi in a burnt sage butter sauce every night. Even the casual dining options, like breakfast in the Lido Café and lunch at Trident Grill, were delicious.I would literally recommend Crystal Cruises for the food alone. But, of course, the cruise gets even better.Destinations We Traveled ToSince our cruise was a “Brazilian Holiday Cruise” we spent our 15-days on board and exploring various destinations along our route from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil!San Juan, Puerto RicoWe boarded our cruise in San Juan but spent a few days prior exploring the beauty of Puerto Rico. My mom and I both fell in love with the colorful buildings of Old San Juan.Read More: 20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Puerto RicoScarborough, Trinidad & TobagoMy mom and I spent our day in Scarborough on individual adventures.

The cruise offered a luxurious travel experience where we could spend quality time together both on and off the ship.I can’t actually say I had ever had 15 days of alone time with my mom!As you can see, I had the most incredible trip aboard Crystal Cruises’ Brazilian Holiday Cruise!If you’re looking for the ultimate luxury cruise experience, I can confidently say there’s nothing that compares to Crystal Cruises.

https://theblondeabroad.com/things-see-world-cup-brazil/,Things To See & Do At The World Cup in Brazil,Brazil,"The summer of 2014 will bring with it a tourism event that happens only once every four years and represents one of the greatest international gatherings on the planet. I’m talking about the World Cup, of course, for which droves of sports fans and travel enthusiasts will be flocking to Brazil in just over a month’s time!Naturally, the main draw at any World Cup is the actual soccer, and Brazil will certainly be no exception. The best players in the world will be competing for their countries and, as is the case in any great tournament, drama seems to be guaranteed. But each World Cup also offers some pretty unique and incredible experiences for tourists who want to enjoy a vacation beyond the stadiums as well. With Brazil 2014, fans will get the chance to enjoy one of the most dynamic destinations in the world!Which brings us to core of the conversation: both inside and outside of the stadiums, here’s a quick look at things you shouldn’t miss if you travel to Brazil this summer!The FoodLet’s face it: food is one of the best parts of many travel experiences, not just because genuine local cuisine tends to be heart-stoppingly delicious. It’s also because eating food from your destination helps you to feel like you’re blending in with the culture.I don’t typically go to Buzzfeed for travel advice, but their list of 24 traditional Brazilian foods to try looks to be spot on. It would be a great food guide to carry with you this summer.You’ll hear a lot about Brazilian steakhouses, but the likes of coxinhas (little fried chicken snacks) and feijoada (hearty black bean and meat stew) aren’t to be ignored!The ContendersMany who visit the World Cup follow one of two strategies: either follow your country (which can be a great way to expose yourself to different cities and venues) or pick a city and watch all the teams that come through. The first option, clearly, is the better way to see more of the country. However, I’d suggest a third option to consider as well: pick a true contender or two, and make sure you get to see them play.This year, the list of true contenders (or at least World Cup favourites) includes Brazil, Argentina, Germany, and Spain. These are probably the top four teams in the world, and a recent Betfair sports article even noted that the group has accounted for five of the last seven World Cup titles!This matters because contenders aren’t only fun to watch for their prowess on the field. They’re fun because of the culture that accompanies them. Nothing beats seeing a World Cup favorite fill the stadium with loyal and passionate fans, and in Brazil—the soccer capital of the world—this idea should be amplified even more.The BeachesAt some point you’ll want a break from soccer (even if only for a few hours), and this is when it might come in handy that Brazil is home to some of the world’s most picturesque, enjoyable, and active beaches. And as it so happens, 8 out of 12 of the host cities (specifically: Fortaleza, Natal, Recife, Salvador, Rio De Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Curitiba, and Porto Alegre) are located right on the Atlantic coast!Each of these cities provides access to intriguing beach areas, though it’s Rio and Sao Paulo, and the stretch of coastline between them, that will always get the most attention. In a rundown of great Brazilian beaches, The Guardian recommends Arpoador (Rio) and Lopes Mendes (Sao Paulo), among others, in particular.The Dancing & FestivalsI could get into recommending certain Brazilian cocktails or popular bars and clubs in host cities, but the bottom line is this: Brazil knows how to party, and you’d be better off getting in your drinking, partying and leisure time at a dancing or festival event, where the spirit of the country will be in full swing. Truth be told, June and July are not what one would typically call festival season in Brazil, but because of the World Cup, there will be plenty of options.In particular, Festas Juninas (June Festivals) will be taking place throughout Brazil and will consist of high-energy, often all-night-long dance parties. Boi-Bumba is another popular festival that will occur during the World Cup and is essentially a carnival-style event (as in, giant, colorful, incredible street party) held in Parintins. And then of course, Rio and Sao Paulo will be home to all kinds of dances, parties, and festive atmospheres. Be sure to take in at least one of these events!Again, the main draw is still going to be the soccer itself and making it to a few matches should be #1 on your list. But to fully enjoy the World Cup experience in Brazil, don’t miss these other attractions and events!"

This adults-only ultra-pool features two bars, an outdoor gaming pavilion, and 20 private cabanas.Helpful Tip: Food at the resort is quite expensive, so be sure to factor in at least $100 per person per day for food!ActivitiesAquaventure waterpark isn’t the only diversion on Paradise Island.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-going-on-an-african-safari/,The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari,Botswana,"One of the best things about living in Cape Town is having the opportunity to explore the depths of Africa. Even after being based here for years, I still jump at the chance to explore the great outdoors. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, there is nothing more captivating than experiencing exotic wildlife in their natural habitat.As completely worthwhile as it is, planning an African safari is a massive undertaking.Where is the best place to go? When is the prime time to spot animals? What should I pack for a safari? You guys have been asking me tons of questions about safaris and I’m ready to cover ‘em all!Ready to get wild? Here is your ultimate guide to going on an African safari.    The Best  Time to Go on SafariImagine the United States, China, India, and most of Europe combined together into one whopping mass of land. That incredible supercontinent will give you an idea of how big Africa is! In fact, Africa is four times larger than the continental US.Of course, if someone asks the best time to visit the US, it would depend on countless factors. The same is true of Africa. This diverse continent has snowy mountains, vast deserts, lush grasslands, and dense forests.You can have a completely different experience at different times of the year.The great thing about the sheer size of Africa is that you can visit any time of the year. Check out my post on the best time to go on safari in Africa for a full month-by-month guide to help you figure out where to go and when.What to Pack for a SafariTypically when it comes to packing, less is more. After all, you can almost always just pop down to the local shopping center and grab whatever you need. It’s a whole different story when you are on safari, however.More of than not, you’ll have no local amenities.When you’re out on a safari, you’re fully exposed to the elements and it’s crucial to have everything that you need for the day. On top of that, luggage space is often strictly limited (if you’re taking short bush flights to get to your destination), so you need to be highly strategic.Before you go, review my breakdown on what to pack for every type of safari so you are looking and feeling fab for every unforgettable second.  How to Find a Safari LodgeFinding the right safari lodge is crucial to the success of your trip! Unlike hotels where you come and go as you like, a safari lodge is typically where you spend much of your time.In most cases, they also provide the game drive itself.It’s totally possible to come all the way to Africa and, for better or worse, only interact with your lodge. Lodges tend to encompass a huge space and offer a lot. Before you commit, do diligent research.The first step to finding the right accommodation for a safari is to choose your safari experience. From tiny tents to luxe lodges, there is something for every type of traveler.One of your early steps is deciding which kind of safari-goer you are.When you know what experience you’re after, carefully review these critical things to look for in a safari lodge.Last but certainly not least, think about the experience from the side of the animals. Safaris are about safely entering animals’ habitat without affecting a thing. Before you decide on a safari company, look for key tips on how to have an ethical animal encounter. Sadly, too many companies are focused on profit over animal welfare.Plan carefully for a cruelty-free adventure.

How Much to Budget for SafariSafaris aren’t cheap and you generally get you what you pay for. Before you go into sticker shock, do keep in mind that safari lodges are typically all-inclusive—so food, lodge, alcohol, and game drives are usually included. The only extra cost will be your flights.When you start considering the details of your trip, read through my guide on how much to budget for an African safari.Generally speaking, I’d highly recommend going for all-inclusive options. While you will see some cheaper options out there, be wary of any all-inclusive stay for less than $1,000 per night. The money you could save will come at the cost of your experience as well as the local ecosystem.If you want to reduce your cost, take a shorter trip. You can have an amazing two-night stay then move onto the more affordable nearby areas to explore nature without doing a formal safari.

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-go-on-safari-in-africa/,The Best Time to Go on Safari in Africa by Month,Botswana,"Since moving to South Africa, going on safari has become one of my favorite things to do. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, the continent has such raw, natural beauty. And Africa has way more diversity than you might think!Far from a one size fits all experience, you can choose the best safari experience in Africa for you and your travel style.I’ve been lucky enough to explore the African bush a few times and experience some of the best safari destinations in Africa. I absolutely adore interacting nature this way and seeing animals in their natural habitats.Of course, if you’re a shutterbug like yours truly, an African safari is a must. You’ll be traveling through some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. African safari photography will take your snaps to the next level.Before you go, check out some of my essential reads for everything you need to know before your first African safari. I’m talking crucial info like how to budget for an African safari and what to pack for a safari.Curious as to when the best time to go on safari is? Because there are so many places to choose from and seasonal differences, I’m breaking it down by month!   Where to Go + WhyPeople often ask me about the best time to go on safari and the top places to check out. The truth is that it totally depends—an African safari is highly seasonal and location dependent.The time of year impacts migration, how wet or dry the land is, and ultimately which animals you are going to see (which is a HUGE factor).The easiest way to decide where to go on safari is to figure out when you’re going. Once you know which month you want to visit Africa, you can start researching where to go on safari.So, animal lovers, here are the best times to go on safari in Africa, based on the month!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari  JanuaryThis is the heart of the rainy season in many of the top safari hotspots—which is not necessarily a bad thing! Rain provides a lush green landscape and there are a few detours you can take to get to dry land.UgandaJanuary is actually the dry season in Uganda so the days are typically warm and sunny, though you’ll want to pack a raincoat for visits around the Volcanoes National Park. It’s prime time for gorilla trekking, which makes this one of the best times to visit Uganda, in my opinion.KenyaIt’s also the dry season in Kenya, which means that the bush and grass are all quite short. This is an advantage in seeing local wildlife. Maasai Mara is one of the most beautiful places in Africa and this is one of the best times to see it.South AfricaIt is the wet season in South Africa so pack a raincoat. Animals are on the move so you will need to be strategic to find them. Explore Sabi Sands near the Mozambique border or head down to Cape Town. Kruger National Park is an amazing safari park right outside of the city.This is especially great for a first safari because you can explore the bright lights of the big town, then simply hop in the car to go for a day trip to Kruger National Park. The animal sightings are just as impressive but there’s less need to rough it or pay for a pricey lodge out in the countryside.TanzaniaJanuary is the end of the rainy season and it is one of the premier months for spotting migrating wildebeest, zebra, and gnu, especially near the southern Ndutu and Salei plains.  UgandaFebruaryLike January, you will run into some rainy spots while exploring much of Africa in February. It is the best time of year to go on a safari though if you are interested in seeing baby animals (and who isn’t?)!South AfricaFebruary is a warm but rainy summer month in South Africa. The beloved Garden Route that runs from Mossel Bay in the west to Storms River in the east is lush and green. Make a stop in Knysna for a perfect base to explore. Make your way up to Kruger National Park to see the Big 5, or come down to Cape Town for an urban wonderland.KenyaBaby animals! Need I say more?For your very own cuteness overload, February is the time to visit Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda to see adorable little guys of all shapes and sizes. February is also good because it is a hot and dry time that will bring out big game and birds in places like Maasai Mara and Laikipia. Safaris will take you to the animals’ fave water spots where they love to hang out. Keep an eye out for wild cats too during this time!TanzaniaWhile the southern part of the country is too hot and humid for me, I love northern Tanzania during February. Almost half a million wildebeest are born in this single month in Tanzania! You will find cheetahs all over the Serengeti while you ooh and ahh at all the little babies. Best of all, the rain passes by Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya during February so it’s prime time for a visit here.Uganda and RwandaThe warm and dry weather makes perfect gorilla trekking conditions! Just be aware that the later you go in February, the more likely you are to run into rain, especially near Volcanoes National Park.Helpful Tip:While I’d recommend seeing as much of Africa as you can during your trip, this isn’t the time to visit Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Namibia if you’re interested in seeing big game. These areas are pretty quiet in February.  MarchFrankly, March isn’t the best time of year for a safari in the majority of Africa. That said, if March is your only available time, there are definitely a couple of places where you can make it work.TanzaniaThe rainy reason is just starting and migration is at its peak. I would highly recommend checking out the Serengeti during the famous Great Migration. It’s also a chance to see the little newborn wildebeests discovering their new world right alongside you.South AfricaThe weather is still good in South Africa in March and it’s a dream season to drive along the renowned Garden Route. It is also a perfect time to visit Kruger and Sabi Sands, though you’ll want to avoid areas close to Botswana and Zambia as they’re both pretty likely to be rained out.  RIVER CRUISE AT MENO A KWENA, BotswanaAprilApril showers bring May…tigers! The continent is washed over in April. Vegetation is ultra lush, which is beautiful but makes it harder to see the animals.Since water is plentiful, animals don’t need to congregate in any particular watering hole because water is all over. This can make animals hard to see in many countries. There are a few key spots that are at their best in April though.BotswanaWith the rivers full to the brim, this is the perfect time to explore the Okavango Delta and visit Victoria Falls. Located between Zimbabwe and Zambia, a trip to Victoria Falls is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Africa. While it’s not peak season for a game viewing safari, this is the best time to visit Botswana if you’re looking to save a bit of cash.Botswana is actually one of the most expensive safari destinations, so traveling outside of peak season can be a major perk for your wallet. Best of all, you can see the incredible raw beauty of the Okavango Delta flooded (a bucket list item for any safari lover!).NamibiaThe wet season is ending in April and Namibia is once against bathed in sun. If you are ready for the ultimate road trip, add a drive across Namibia to your things to do in Africa list.South AfricaWelcome to autumn in South Africa! As cooler and drier weather comes, trees lose their leaves and it’s easy to spot the local wildlife. Local game reserves are a perfect destination.TanzaniaIn April, I would highly recommend checking out the northern parks of Tanzania. It is a top time to go on a safari and you will be able to avoid peak season, which runs from July to October.  MayJust as things are warming up in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a chill in the air south of the equator. When it comes to the best time to go on safari, this simply isn’t prime time for most of Africa—with one spectacular exception though!MozambiqueJust before the peak season, Mozambique is at its best. The afternoons get into the high 80s while the afternoons rarely fall below 50 degrees. The skies are clearing up as the rainy season ends. Hotspots like Gorognosa and Niassa are prime for exploration.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Mozambique   Namibia JuneJune is the turning point of the year in Africa. Goodbye, rain. Hello, sunshine! June is one of the best times of year to go on safari in Africa in so many diverse spots around the continent.South AfricaIn South Africa, you’ll find two distinctly different seasons in June. In the northern part of the country, things are drying out. It’s peak game viewing time up there and the days are sunny. In the south, near Cape Town, however, it’s the absolute rainiest time of the year.While it’s not great for a safari, it is the best time of year to see the whale migration in the Southern Cape. Explore the delta as herds head to Chobe and then make their way over to Linyanti.NamibiaThe weather is dry and relatively warm. As the natural sources of water are diminished by the arid season, it is easy to spot animals hanging out together at local water sources. Be sure to plan ample time to explore Etosha National Park.ZimbabweThe peak season here is from June to September. During June, the landscape is drying out. You know by now that dry weather means animals partying at the local watering hole! June is also a dream month to visit Victoria Falls (and I’d highly recommend flying over to see the falls while they’re at their most powerful of the year).  OKAVANGO RIVER CRUISEJulyDry season is in full swing and you will be spoilt for choice all around the continent. This is peak travel time and easily the best time of year for a safari in the majority of the best spots in Africa.It’s nearly impossible to choose the best place to go in July—but you better hurry!This is the most popular time of year and things sell out fast. Of course, that means that trips come at a premium so your options for a budget safari are pretty limited.TanzaniaSerengeti National Park is a massive draw during July. The Great Migration in northern Serengeti will truly blow your mind. Elephants are migrating in Tarangire while spots like Katavi, Selous, and Ruaha offer something a bit more off the beaten path.South AfricaMore of the same from June, the weather in the north of South Africa is getting even drier and spotting wildlife is getting even easier. Meanwhile, the Cape is still rained out but with perfect whale spotting conditions.BotswanaJuly is definitely one of the best times of year to visit Botswana. Famous areas like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and Linyanti are flawless. The Delta is gloriously flooded and animal spotting is as likely as ever. Just note that animals have mostly left the Pans and Kalahari area.KenyaThe Great Migration is running its way through Maasai Mara during July and August. We are talking wildebeest and zebra galore! It is an amazing time but definitely busy. Take your time and do some research while picking a camp so you don’t end up anywhere too crowded when safari madness sweeps the world.  Kenya Ultimate GuideAugustAnother unbeatable time of year for an African safari! The weather is still dry for a bit longer and ideal across the continent in many spots.KenyaYou haven’t missed the Great Migration yet so get to Maasai Mara to see a draw-dropping movement of wildebeests and zebras. Be sure to spend at least part of your safari at the river where you can see these guys zigzagging between crocodiles as they make their way across the river.TanzaniaYou can also check out dramatic river crossing in Tanzania, especially in Lamai and Kogatende. Iconic spots like the Serengeti National Park are at their best as the elephant migration takes over the country (around in Tarangire). While tourism is at its peak, you can still check to find tranquil spots around Selous, Ruaha, and Katavi.BotswanaIf you want to see majestic elephants, look no further.The Chobe and Linyanti area has more of these massive cuties than anywhere else on the continent. The Okavango Delta is still flooded as well and looks incredible at this time of year. Just note that the Pans and the Kalahari are largely empty at this time of year as the local wildlife vacations abroad.ZimbabweAlso in its peak season, Zimbabwe is at the top of its game for safaris. Adventure lovers will want to make sure to hop over to Victoria Falls after the game spotting for more heart-stopping fun. The water is a bit lower at this time of year and it’s white water rafting season.NamibiaFor more unforgettable animal sightings, get to Etosha then make your way out to the Skeleton Coast to soak in the otherworldly beauty. Just LOOK at my latest pics and you won’t be able to wait another minute to see this epic country.  KenyaSeptemberGo big or go home in September! During the heart of the dry season, you are going to see the biggest of big game animals at top spots around the continent.TanzaniaDuring the Great Migration, Tanzania is at its peak with constant river crossings and elephants thundering through. Of course, the Serengeti National Park is an essential destination. For river crossings, the northern part of the park around Lamai and Kogatende is the place to be. To get up close and personal with the majestic elephants of Tanzania, be sure to plan time for Tarangire National Park.BotswanaSeptember is the best time to visit Botswana. Famous spots like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and the Linyanti are truly at their very best. Chobe and Linyanti is the elephant capital of Africa for the time. Meanwhile, the Okavango Delta is flooded and sparkling with beauty. While the whole country is beautiful, steer clear of the Pans and Kalahari areas, which many of the animals have left behind for the season.ZimbabweDry season is upon Zimbabwe and the conditions in the country couldn’t be better. After most of the tourists have gone home, all of the animals are gathering at their watering holes, and the country is ripe for exploration.NamibiaGet to Etosha peaks for unbeatable game viewing then make your way over to the Skeleton Coast for some of the most gorgeous scenery in all of Africa.MozambiqueTourists are clearing out as summer comes to an end (but the weather is still gorgeous!) in Mozambique. If you are looking to squeeze in a beach break during your African safari, look no further than this coastal retreat.KenyaOf course, it’s all about the Great Migration in Maasai Mara. This is one of the best times to visit Kenya. When you want to get away from the tourist hotspots, check out the quieter regions of the north. Game viewing is equally impressive up there but you’ll be a bit more off the beaten path.OctoberThe dry season is coming to an end in October but you can still find prime conditions across the country before the rain really starts to roll in.ZimbabweThe bush is still quite dry around Zimbabwe so animals are chilling around the most popular water sources. While the weather is still quite hot, it’s bearable. Be sure to plan time for Ruaha and Katavi where the tourists have cleared out and big game have taken their place. In the north, the Tarangire area is filled with elephants while the Serengeti is seeing many river crossings.KenyaPrices are lower than usual while the game is still active and visible. If you are looking for a budget safari option that will knock your hiking boots off, this one’s for you.TanzaniaStill in its peak season, it is warm but not crazy hot in Tanzania. To escape the heat of places like Zimbabwe, wildlife is coming to the permanent watering hole they know and love in Tanzania.  MEERKAT SAFARI IN BOTSWANANovemberThe southern side of Africa is into the rainy season. Humidity and heat (don’t forget it’s summer down here!) make it pretty uncomfortable in a lot of places. There is a minor East African migration for serious safari-goers in Liuwa Plain National Park but, otherwise, many of the popular spots are a washout.TanzaniaIf you stick to the northern part, you will see migrating herds making their way across the country despite the weather.BotswanaWhile it is not your traditional African safari fare, the skies above Botswana are alive with action. Birds are migrating through the Okavango Delta while dramatic storms sweep in for stunning photo ops.Although the weather is hot, it is at least a dry heat with the exception of passing storms. Since it’s not peak season, you can grab a major deal on when camps are offering up to 40 percent off their peak rates.DecemberWant to decorate the yuletide bush and ring in the new year under the stars? East Africa is the best place to be for a winter break in Africa. Across the regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the weather is dry and the animals are active.KenyaThe rainy season in Kenya is coming to an end in the middle of December. The scenery is lush and emerald but that makes it a bit tougher to spot game. It’s still worth it though! The Maasai Mara, Laikipia, and Lewa areas are drop-dead gorgeous at the end of the year.TanzaniaThe Serengeti and Ngorongoro area beautiful at this time of year but across the country rainfall will be making it a bit harder to spot game. Stick to the Northern Circuit to see the locals celebrating Christmas in their own way.OverallSo, my fellow explorers, that is all you need to create your perfect safari. I know there are a TON of options. Every month offers something a bit different.The bottom line is: just go! Africa, as a whole, is certainly one of the most underrated travel destinations on the planet. My best advice is to simply find a place that intrigues you and go for it.For me, the most dynamic and interesting countries in Africa for a safari are Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and, of course, my adopted home of South Africa.Note, while there are other places I could have included on this list, I mainly stuck to the ones with my opinion of “best experiences.”But I’d love to hear your opinions and what places you would suggest during certain times of the year below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-travel-botswana/,The Best Time to Travel to Botswana,Botswana,"Out of all of the safari destinations in all of Africa, Botswana is one of my favorites. Why? Alllllll the opportunities to view some of the most spectacular animals! Because it’s known for its wildlife sightings, planning your trip around the weather and the way it impacts the land is key.The country has two main seasons: the dry season and rainy season.Knowing when these are and how they impact the local flora and fauna is crucial. Whether you’re looking to spot wild cheetahs and elephants or you’re looking to take a mokoro (traditional canoe) around the shallow waters of the Okavango Delta…I’m breaking down the best times to travel to Botswana!Don’t miss my 10-day itinerary for Botswana!  September to NovemberBotswana’s spring season is September through the end of November, and it’s deemed the country’s shoulder season. During these months, temperatures rise and the land is parched.Activities during the middle of the day are best to be avoided as temps can get above 40 C (or 104 F)! Migrant birds are active during the later part of the season and their arrival oftentimes coincides with the first rains.Don’t let the heat deter you though as there are a few exciting events that take place from September to December!On September 30th, locals celebrate Botswana Day, a day that serves as a remembrance of the advances the country has made since its declaration of independence from Britain in 1966. Expect to see street parties, parades, and locals celebrating.   Okavango River CruiseDecember to MarchCome December, the rain officially begins, marking the beginning of summer.Unfortunately, the weather can be a bit unpredictable during the summer months. Not only is it extremely warm, but there’s also a chance that the rain doesn’t come at all.However, if the rain does come, the African landscape is completely transformed. Flowers begin blooming and the land that was once brown and dry is covered in lush greenery. This, of course, draws the animals in and you’ll likely see zebras, warthogs, and impalas everywhere you turn.The greenery makes this the optimal time to visit Botswana.Although some camps close down for the rainy months, others stay open and offer discounted rates to attract out-of-season visitors. The rain isn’t typically constant and days are often sunny with brief downpours in the afternoon so if you’re willing to face a little rain, humidity, and mosquitoes, this is one of the best times to visit.A few celebrations take place in the summer months, too! In February, the country celebrates World Wetlands Day, an event that focuses on the environment and conservation. In March in Gaborone, the Maitisong Festival lasts nine days and includes traditional dancing, music, and theater.   April to SeptemberFinally, April through September is all about the dry season.All of the floodwaters from the rains have made their way down to the deltas, attracting thousands of animals. You’ll be able to see large herds of elephants, buffalo, and antelope along with the predators that prey on them.This dry season also means fewer mosquitoes and pesky insects so you won’t have to spend your vacation covered in calamine lotion!Temperatures average about 75 degrees during the day and can get as low as 35 degrees during the evenings so it’s wise to pack layers, especially if you plan to go on safari at night,If you’re interested in learning more about Botswana’s fascinating history and culture, visit in April and attend the Maun Festival, a two-day celebration that includes music, dancing, and poetry.OverallRegardless of the time of year, the wildlife and scenery in Botswana will blow you out of the water. In terms of weather, October and November can be quite hot, while January and February are the peak times of the wet season.If you want unparalleled game viewing, plan your trip during the dry season (April to September). If you’re a bird lover, visit Botswana between December and March and experience the country’s beautiful emerald season!Have you ever been to Botswana or are you planning a future trip?

These three-story raised platforms were made for spending the night under the stars deep in the Khwai Private Reserve. If you are there during the dry season, don’t miss out on this.Game DriveOutside of Sable Alley, you will be able to see four of the big five: lions, leopards, elephants and Cape buffalos (no rhinoceros)! During our visit, there was a three-week-old leopard, so you might just see a baby leopard learning the wildlife ropes. There is also a “hide room” where you can literally climb underground near a waterhole to watch wildlife up-close and personal!There are only seven guests allowed per vehicle and just three vehicles out at any sighting, so these drives never feel cramped.Okavango River CruiseWe had an amazing mokoro (a type of canoe) trip with a local guide. Gliding through the beautiful scenery and lush plants of the Okavango Delta made for a relaxing afternoon out.Chill in the LodgeThe open-plan lounge and dining space were seemingly made just for relaxing with a book and admiring the incredible scenery outside. Be sure to check out the hippo pool when there — it’s just 100 feet from the deck, and it’s filled with hippos all year round.There’s also a plunge pool and sun deck, so you’ll find plenty of spaces to soak in the warm African air. And, don’t miss your chance to visit the famous “loo with a view” in the main lodge!The PropertyPlaying an integral role in local conservation initiatives, Sable Alley was created in partnership with the Botswana Predator Conservation Trust and Round River Conservation Studies. They donate a portion of all of their profits to eco-efforts that serve to keep Africa beautiful.Sable Alley just opened in May 2017, and they’ve already become incredibly popular. With just twelve tents, they have a very high occupancy rate, so book in advance if you want to experience the Khwai Private Reserve.Luxury TentsThe camp features twelve en-suite solar-powered tents. Each one has a private veranda overlooking the lagoon, plains and the Moremi Game Reserve.I absolutely loved the Afro-chic style of this place. The attention to detail is clear at every turn, and it was by far the most luxurious experience of my Botswana trip.From the outdoor showers of your tent, you can actually see the wildlife. And, it goes without saying, the outdoor bathtub in the Honeymoon Tent is a page straight out of Pinterest!Food + DrinkAll of the food and drinks are included in your stay at Sable Alley. They have a fresh selection of local dishes for breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus a daily afternoon tea.As far as the bar, we were definitely impressed by the variety. There was a variety of regional wines and spirits. Since it’s an open bar, we could just help ourselves.My Experience at Sable AlleyThe staff was wonderful throughout our stay. Our guide, KG, was very knowledgeable and personable. We also got to connect with Angel and Hazel, the managers on duty, who were both incredibly friendly.We came during the rainy season, which runs from November until March. There are some definite advantages to traveling during the off-season (fewer guests, lower prices, etc.); however, rain showers are a certainty. You can find out more about the best time to visit Botswana here.Bottom line: Sable Alley is a great value for your money and one of the best options for getting into the Botswana bush.Don’t miss my Botswana travel video!More InformationHotel: Sable AlleyLocation: Okavango Delta, BotswanaAccommodation: Glamping, Luxury, SafariPrice Range: $$$Thanks to Meno a Kwena for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-meno-a-kwena-in-botswana/,Staying at Meno a Kwena in Botswana,Botswana,"With a picture-perfect location on the Boteti River in Botswana, Meno a Kwena (translated to “teeth of the crocodile”) is a place to disconnect. The simple and unpretentious Meno a Kwena camp is one of just a handful of options for staying in the stunning Makgadikgadi Pans National Park.Here’s my experience staying at Meno a Kwena in Botswana!How to Get ThereMeno a Kwena is located at the west end of Makgadikgadi Pans National Park. We arrived by driving after staying at Jack’s Camp, which takes around five hours.If you go this route, I’d definitely recommend stopping by Planet Baobab for a quick bite. It’s a bit out of the way but it’s a very cool backpacker/budget spot with massive Baobab trees with decent Wi-Fi.Read More: 10-Day Botswana ItineraryThe Camp at Meno a KwenaMeno a Kwena is no frills. Though if you do need to stay connected, there is Wi-Fi in the main lodge area, which is fast enough to send emails and messages.This cozy camp has nine tents, a swimming pool and complimentary laundry service. There are also battery-charging facilities in the rooms and main tent.What to Do at Meno a KwenaRiver CruiseThis was an amazing experience. There were so many elephants, and they come right to the river to drink, so we got a perfect view. Certain times of the year, you’ll see all types of animals along the river bank, and you’ll likely see hippos out there, too.Game DriveMeno a Kwena is located next to Makgadikgadi Pans National Parks which is where game drives are offered. Because it was an hour and a half drive there and back, we skipped this one, but it could be worth checking out. There are a lot of animals in the area, especially during the dry season, which is from April to October.Bushman WalkWe had already done a walk at Jack’s Camp, but if this is your only stop in the area, I’d highly suggest going on a bush walk with the local Khoisan people.The PropertyIt’s all about the location here. Meno a Kwena Tented Camp is on a rocky cliff top above the Boteti River, and the surroundings are stunning.That said, the camp itself is very simple and didn’t impress us in the same way that some of the other camps we traveled to in Botswana did. There were no standout features and the design was basic, but comfortable.Safari TentsThere are nine classic tents at Meno a Kwena with locally woven textiles and fully equipped en-suite bathrooms. You can opt for an indoor or outdoor shower, which is handy.They just added two new family units, which are good for kids. Or, you can opt for a classic room with either two single beds or a king-sized bed.Be sure to bring earplugs! The monkeys make for very noisy neighbors.Food + DrinkAll meals and drinks are included in the price of a stay. The food was buffet style and quite delicious!Dining is group-style for every meal. Since we were the only people staying at the camp, it was just us and the staff eating together. If you want to dine in private, don’t hesitate to ask.My Experience at Meno a KwenaTruth be told, I didn’t fall in love with this camp. As I mentioned, the location is truly amazing and I think visiting during the dry season (when the zebra and wildebeest come to the river during migration) is probably a life-changing experience. I’ve always had above and beyond customer service at game lodges, but here, the staff was underwhelming (with the exception of our guide, Mpathi, who was great!)If you are looking to stay in this price range, however, Meno a Kwena is worth checking out. It’s river experience is definitely one for the books.Don’t miss my Botswana travel video!More InformationHotel: Meno a KwenaLocation: Makgadikgadi, BotswanaAccommodation: Glamping, SafariPrice Range: $$$All photos edited with #TBAPresets!Thanks to Meno a Kwena for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-jacks-camp-in-botswana/,Staying at Jack’s Camp in Botswana,Botswana,"Hello, old-world glamour! I’m Kiersten, a long-time fan. In Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, I indulged my love for vintage luxury at one of Botswana’s most beautiful camps.Here’s my experience staying at Jack’s Camp in Botswana! How to Get to Jack’s CampLocated in northeast Botswana, Jack’s Camp is about 1,000 kilometers northwest of Pretoria, South Africa and 1,000 kilometers northeast of Windhoek, Namibia.The best way to get to Jack’s camp is with a one-hour bush flight from Maun, which is the tourist capital of Botswana and a common base for exploring the Okavango Delta. What to ExpectThis is a place to disconnect! There is no Wi-Fi or electricity.You can charge your gear in the main tent, which is great for camera batteries and other essentials. Outside of that, you’ll get a much needed digital detox while here!One of our favorite things about Jack’s Camp is the personalized service. We were greeted by Charles, the property manager, who’s a very helpful, polite and all-around great guy.   What to Do at Jack’s CampGame DrivesThere are so many wild animals here! The rainy season, which lasts from November to March, is migration season for zebras and wildebeests, so pack a raincoat and come prepared for incredible photo opportunities. If you get a chance to hang with Greg, he’s an awesome guide and photography enthusiast!See the MeerkatsJack’s Camp and its sister lodge, San Camp, are the only permanent camps in the 3,900-square-kilometer Makgadikgadi Pans National Park. Jack’s Camp is one of the best places to hang out with meerkats in Botswana– there’s a family of habituated meerkats there!For 15 years, researchers have been studying this meerkat family every day, so these little ones have come to see humans not as a threat, but as a natural part of their habitat. That means that you can get up close and personal with them!Jack’s has a “meerkat specialist,” who will take you out to visit the meerkat family, and it’s such a memorable experience. Meerkats, especially this fun family, aren’t shy about interacting.If they sense a predator nearby, they will scramble up the tallest point they can find, which may very well be on top of your head! Of course, like all wild animals, you don’t want to come on too strong and you should never touch them. Just snap some pics and you might get lucky!Bush Walk with the Khoisan TribeJack’s Camp arranges for an English-speaking Khoisan tribe member to take you on a bush walk and act as an interpreter for the tribe. It’s an incredible opportunity to learn about their unique way of life.One interesting part of the walk was seeing the tribe’s natural remedies. Tribe members dug up different plants and explained their medicinal value, and how they use them.Quads and HorsesWe missed out on this because we visited during the wet season, but if you come during the dry season (April to October), there are some great options for exploring.PoolJack’s has an awesome pool pavilion, and it’s the perfect hangout space. There’s plenty of space to lie out to soak in the sun and watch the animals wander past. The Jack’s Camp PropertyThis place is seriously secluded. It is one of only three camps in a 1-million-acre private game reserve. There are 50,000 zebras and wildebeests that migrate through this space from January to April, and it’s absolutely magical.Jack first settled here back in 1966 and fell in love with Botswana’s natural beauty. An innovator, Jack was one of the first people to start photography safaris back in the ’70s and ’80s.Jack’s ashes are now scattered here and five generations of his family have worked to preserve the land. The camp is now a registered museum and displays all sorts of cool archeological finds. Safari TentsWith the elegance of a bygone era, the rooms here look like traditional 1940’s African colonial Safari tents. Every eclectic space is dotted with keepsakes that Jack’s family has collected over the years.The rooms reminded me of the Quidditch World Cup tents from Harry Potter, so you know I was in heaven!Like all good glampgrounds, each tent at Jack’s Camp has an outdoor shower. There are also places to hang out like the pool pavilion, a low-tech entertainment area with a pool table and library, as well as a bar specializing in local beer, wine and spirits. Food + DrinkAll of the food and drinks are included in a stay at Jack’s Camp. And all of our meals were absolutely delicious. Best of all, they are very accommodating for all types of diets, so you can always find what you like. My Experience at Jack’s CampI absolutely loved this camp! Everything felt vintage yet opulent. My boyfriend, Meyer, ended up seriously sick from taking anti-malarial tablets and missed out on most of the experience, so I was on my own. Despite going at it solo, I had a great time at Jack’s Camp. Huge thanks to Greg, my guide, for taking me to all of the best photo opps!Given the opportunity to stay a third night, I would say yes without hesitation. The meerkats were obviously a huge highlight and the Khoisan experience was unforgettable. I would have loved one more day to laze around the camp and shoot at the big salt pan but, with so much to see and do, it was a wonderful whirlwind trip! Check out my Botswana travel video!

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-canada/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Canada,Canada,"Whether you’re looking to celebrate Canada Day like a local, heading to the Great White North to experience unparalleled nature, or you’re ready to delve into some of the coolest cities around…I know of a place. 🙂Whatever you’re planning, Canada has got it all!The country itself is vast. It’s got 16 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and the longest ski season in the world (talk about chilly!). Because the climate tends to run on the colder side, locals invented the delicious and seriously heartwarming comfort food of poutine. Oh, and it just so happens to be home to some of the friendliest people on the planet.Canada is pretty darn cool, eh?But there’s so much more to discover, so here are my top 10 tips for your first trip to Canada!   Moraine LakeWeatherCanada is a huge country with a dramatically varied landscape from coast to coast. So depending on which part of the country you’re visiting make sure you pack for the right temps.Bring plenty of layers if you’re hopping around the country, even in the summer!If you’re planning on driving around Canada, make sure you check the weather conditions before you head out. Also, check for road closures! This’ll save you a lot of frustration along the way. Peak SeasonSummer is the busiest time of the year and Canadians like to make the most of the warmer months. Although, to avoid the crowds and the higher flight prices I like to visit during the spring and fall (September – November). You can catch the intense red leaves that Canada is famous for but miss the crowds and the cold. Win-win!If you’re going to Canada for their incredible skiing then visiting in winter is going to be your cup of tea. Whistler and Mont Tremblant are two of my favorite Canadian winter cities.Another key time to visit? For the Calgary Stampede at the beginning of July. What’s the Calgary Stampede, you ask? Oh, just the largest rodeo in the world and lasts several days (it’s where the above photo is from!).Even if hanging with the cowboys doesn’t sound like your thing, there are tons of live music and drinking events throughout the entirety of the festival. LanguageAlthough most people speak English in Canada, there’s also a huge French-speaking population with over 7.2 million people speaking it as their first language. It’s one of the official languages and is mostly spoken in Quebec but you’ll find smaller French-speaking communities in areas like New Brunswick Ontario, and Manitoba.  BeaverTails Poutine Canadian FoodCanada is a hot destination for foodies right now and there are some local staples that you just have to try!If you love beer, then you’ll feel right at home in British Columbia which has a huge craft beer culture (I’m alllll about this!). Not to mention the food truck scene which has exploded in the last few years. The food trucks feature a ton of international delicacies and some of the best local food around.Goodies You Don’t Want to Miss Out On:Poutine: A layered concoction of fries, both cheese curds, and melted cheese, and tons of gravy.BeaverTails: Sweet tooths will love this Canadian institution of fried dough topped with everything from M&M’s to Nutella to straight cinnamon and sugar!Pâté Chinois: This is very similar to the Brit’s shepherd’s pie with mincemeat and mashed potatoes but with the addition of creamed corn.Caesar Cocktails: Drink like a Canadian by trying out this vibrant cocktail of vodka, clamato (tomato and clam juice), Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Like a Bloody Mary…but with a twist!Don’t Pass Up Tim HortonsFor all your budget coffee and snack needs, head over to Tim Hortons—possibly one of Canada’s favorite exports. Even though you’ll find them all over the world now, Timmies are at their best and cheapest in Canada.Read More:The Ultimate Vancouver Brewery and Food Truck Guide   Banff National ParkPlaces to VisitRemember how I said Canada is a really vast place? Well, all that vast space contains some of the coolest urban cities and most awe-inspiring national parks. Here are some of my favorite places to visit in Canada:Vancouver: British Columbia’s largest city, Vancouver is the epitome of cool with its buzzing food and craft beer scene, plus its stunning landscapes.Toronto: One of the most diverse cities in the world, you can hear over 140 languages spoken in Toronto with over half of the residents being born outside of Canada. It’s an exciting city that’s well known for its music and festival scene as well as many of the world’s most esteemed restaurants.Quebec City: With a strong European, North American, and Canadian vibes, Quebec is a fascinating, historical city. Most of the residents speak French and the architecture is some of the prettiest in the country.Montreal: The biggest city within the Quebec province, there’s a lot to love in this busy metropolis. It’s set on an island in the Saint Lawrence River and it’s packed with museums and galleries.Whistler: For a local’s experience, head to a frozen lake for ice hockey, ice fishing, or, if you’re like me, bring along a bottle of bubbly and ask for a pull on a toboggan.Mont Tremblant: If you are looking for a gorgeous winter break, Mont Tremblant is the place to be. Just eighty miles outside of Montreal, this place is the perfect spot to play in the snow.Banff: Banff is one of the most beautiful national parks in Canada. It boasts breathtaking mountain scenery, epic hiking trails, and picturesque camping grounds and lodges.Calgary: The cosmopolitan city in Alberta, Calgary is quite the cool city with its many skyscrapers and the annual event of the Calgary Stampede!Vancouver Island: The ideal place for a summer getaway!Manitoba: Looking to see for polar bears and beluga whales? Manitoba is the place!  WhistlerParksCanada’s park system is unparalleled, whether you’re hoping to see turquoise lakes, sandy beaches, lush forests or craggy coastline you’ll find it in Canada. Some of the must-visit parks include Banff—the first and most stunning national park in Canada, along with the Whistler mountain bike park, and a visit to Ontario to see the Niagra Falls.    Be PoliteWhile this may seem like an obvious one, Canadians are known for being super polite which is something I’m totally on board with. So get used to hearing and saying ‘sorry’ a lot and avoid any typically rude behavior like cutting the line or being overly drunk in public. Learn the Local SlangCanadians have some of the most lovely and adorable slang words in the Western world!Here are a few you’ll hear on a day-to-day basis in Canada:Loony/Toony: a loony is a one-dollar coin and a toony is a two-dollar coin.Timmies: Nice and simple, this is short for Tim Hortons. Order a “Double Double” if you want a double dose of cream and sugar in your coffee.Kerfuffle: a disagreement or an argument—anything less than a fight.  Getting AroundSo you won’t have to take a helicopter everywhere…Getting from one place to another in Canada is definitely something you want to plan in advance. It’s not as easy as jumping on the train as you might in Europe. I’d suggest just choosing one section of the country to visit if you’re short on time, or if you’re making it a longer trip—rent a car!Within the major cities, you’ll find various modes of transportation like a subway system and buses, you’ll also find taxis and Ubers in all of the major urban areas. Vancouver famously has the SkyTrain as well as the usual urban transport. You’ll also find some regional coaches such as Greyhound or GO Bus but they will only take you so far.Again, renting a car will be your best bet if you’re looking to get around non-urban areas. Visa + Travel InsuranceSome nationalities require an ETA visa for Canada—it can be purchased online and it’s pretty cheap. It’s currently not required for U.S citizens with a valid passport but always check for any changes on their website!Travel insurance is key for anywhere you go, but especially if you’re taking part in any winter sports, hiking, or taking a road trip around Canada. You never know what’s going to happen and it’s best to be covered, just in case. TippingIf you think their bills look a little like Monopoly money, you’re not alone.Each bill is a different color and made of plastic!Nonetheless, tipping in Canada still applies and it’s about 15-20% of the total bill in hospitality, tourism and the service industries.I’ve also been told the $100 bill smells like maple syrup, but I can’t personally confirm! lol   MontrealOverallCanada is an amazing country to explore if you enjoy buzzing cities, delicious food, and some of the most awe-inspiring nature in the world! Plus, Canadians usually offer a very warm welcome.Now, onto the poutine and Timmies! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/let-go-in-quebec/,Let Go in Québec,Canada,"Being a travel blogger means living a huge part of my life online. From shooting photos to creating posts to connecting with readers on social media, sometimes it feels like I’m always staring at a screen. And that’s exactly why I decided that it was time for a break from my busy schedule.Québec invited me to disconnect from my routine so that I could fully connect with the destination. Living without my phone for five days, I was able to experience travel again like I used to– before the blog.Here’s my experience disconnecting in Québec!I visited the beautiful province of Québec in Canada with a documentary film crew to capture the full experience. It was the first time in the better part of a decade that I didn’t have my camera with me for a whole trip, and in hindsight, it was such a good feeling to be able to disconnect and be in the moment.While it took an adjustment period, it was actually very liberating to see new places without any distractions. Having a digital break in Québec allowed me to truly take in the incredible natural beauty of Canada. And, while a lot of people opt to disconnect out in the wilderness, Québec offered the perfect balance for me.There are so many places in and around Montréal to both relax and live it up! I have had some incredible adventures in Montréal before but traveling disconnected allowed me to see the region through a new pair of eyes.With a cool intermingling of old world European culture (come ready to practice your French!), this vibrant North American city has it all.Ready to see it for yourself? Check out my ultimate Montréal travel guide before you go!The thing that I love most about Montréal is that it offers the perfect blend of urban fun and adventures in nature. You can get the full “disconnected and enjoying wildlife” experience without having to travel far into the countryside.Right outside of the city, you can fly through the forest on a zipline or relax out in a boat out on the lake. I fell in love Lac Sacacomie, a beautiful lake just outside of the Mastigouche Wildlife Reserve between Québec City and Montréal.While it’s great to have a digital break in the middle of nature, I tend to crave city life after awhile. The nice thing about a trip to Québec is that you can create this balance of urban and rural. Once I had my fix of outdoor fun, I explored some of the hotspots of Montréal. When it comes to checking out cool ‘hoods in Montréal, it’s all about Mile End, Little Italy, and Old Montréal.I’d recommend grabbing a bike to explore the city. There are so many quirky little corners and stately spots to see.Be sure to get up to Mount Royal for a perfect view of the city!Thank you to Quebéc for hosting me during this trip.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-time-to-go-to-montreal/,The Best Time to Travel to Montreal,Canada,"One of the most beautiful and fascinating cities in North America, Montreal is a must-see. I fell in love with the city’s European charm and Canadian hospitality. It’s a totally unique city that deserves a place on every traveler’s bucket list. With four distinct seasons, every month in Montreal has its own appeal.Here’s the best time to go to Montreal!Summer in MontrealMonths: June – AugustWith temperatures consistently in the mid to high seventies, summer in Montreal is perfect. Tourists flock to the city to wander through the historic streets, lounge at the sidewalk cafés, and live it up at the world-class nightclubs.Montreal’s summer festival calendar is truly epic.Whatever you are into, there is a celebration for you. From the Formula One Grand Prix of Canada in June to the Montreal International Tango Festival in August, this is the best time of year to mingle with the locals.Be sure to check out the Montreal International Jazz Festival and Montreal’s Just For Laughs Comedy Festival throughout June and July as well as Montreal Pride in August.(source)Autumn in MontrealMonths: September – NovemberFall is another perfect time to visit Montreal. The crowds of tourists start to clear out in September and the weather remains fairly warm until November. You can expect overnight lows in the upper forties and afternoon highs in the upper sixties in September. The temps slowly lower to the upper twenties in November.Grab a warm jacket and boots, and you’ll be set to go.One of my favorite events of the year is POP Montreal in September. This festival is an impressive celebration of all things music, fashion, and art. Be sure to also check out the World Film Festival that takes place over August and September.And, if you are in Montreal in October, don’t miss the Montreal Burlesque Festival!(source)Winter in MontrealMonths: December – FebruaryIt’s well worth braving a bit of cold to see Montreal in the winter. From December to February, you can often expect to see temperatures in the single digits. If you are in the Great White North in late January or early February, check out the spectacular Quebec Winter Carnival.Another gorgeous event is the Montréal En Lumière. Held throughout late February and early March, this is a local favourite. There are hundreds of food and wine tastings alongside endless live entertainment options. It all takes place in a beautiful setting in the heart of the Quartier. Best of all, the Montréal En Lumière is free every year!Need a break from the cold?Get to Montreal’s brilliant Underground City. This massive maze of passageways will take you all over downtown Montreal. Check out the countless shop, restaurants, and cinemas without ever having to touch the sidewalk. When it’s zero degrees and snowing, this is the perfect escape!Spring in MontrealMonths: March – MayI love visiting Montreal in the spring. The city comes alive from March to May when the snow clears and the gardens start to blossom. While temps are still hovering in the thirties during March, they will warm up to the midsixties by May.You will still need a jacket, but it’s the perfect time to explore the city before the tourists arrive.While it may be a French-influenced city, Montreal has an amazing Saint Patrick’s Day Parade. It’s the oldest Saint Patrick’s Day parade in Canada, and it’s always full of energy. Another great event is the Vue sur la Relève Festival in April.With all of the best music, theatre, and dance from all over the French-speaking world, there are tons of up-and-coming acts you won’t want to miss."
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-montreal/,Where to Find the Best Food in Montreal,Canada,"Montreal, I thought you were completely and utterly great.  You exceeded my expectations on so many levels and I can’t wait until we meet again.  Montreal is super easy to navigate, full of incredibly genuine and friendly people, and has multiple cool neighborhoods in which to explore.  It is also a ridiculously great food city- I ate like a champion over the quick weekend I was here.  Next time, I’d do the below, and I’d also add a few more.  I didn’t even make it through half of my long to go to list, but you can bet I did my absolute best.  Here are my highlights of food in Montreal!Beauty’s LuncheonetteMontreal is known for it’s bagels.  Much softer, much sweeter, and also much smaller than our famous New York bagel, Beauty’s Luncheonette’s menu is mostly based around this admittedly very good little staple.  Saint ParvisYou know when you go somewhere and it’s beautiful and dreamy and you want to just move right in?  This is what happens when you step foot in Saint Parvis, part coffee shop, part restaurant, wholly something really special.   For one, it’s absolutely gorgeous.  There are plants everywhere; up along the ceiling on the shelves, by the huge glass storefront, in the corners, on the bar, all over the place.  The distressed walls are painted in a soft sage green, too, giving the overall illusion of a secret garden come to life in downtown Montreal.  The food is designed to match, equally artful and light looking.  We had the salmon gravlax over brioche with goat cheese, avocado and beets.  Le Vin PapillonWe learned that in Montreal there are two types of bar licenses; the one where you can just have drinks, and the one where you have to have a bit of food with your cocktail.  The latter is the way at wine bar gone highly respected food locale Le Vin Papillon, and we were so incredibly happy that it was.  We had about an hour before our dinner reservation at sister spot Nora Gray, and so wanted to eat well, but eat light.  Recommended to us by Max the bartender was the famous carrot eclair and the simple but delicious artichoke hearts with shaved parmesan and olive oil.  We liked all of these things, Max the bartender included.  Nora GrayFeeling like a swanky house party in the Boogie Nights day and age, Nora Gray delivers on so many fronts.  While maybe not quite as wild the image this sentence conjures up, you will get the dimly lit corners, the funky music, and an array of very friendly people at all turns.  The food is set to match, too- there’s poached lobster, a couple of exceptional pastas, and a first-rate burrata situation you won’t want to miss.  St Viateur BagelImmediately following our bagels at Beauty’s, we bashfully walked into St Viateur Bagel and stared.  After sufficient ogling on our part, the kind man manning the ovens cranking these incredible smelling things grabbed two piping hot sesame (the bagel staple of Montreal), put them in a brown to go bag, and sent us on our merry way.  DamasSyrian food is probably not most people’s first inclination as to what to eat when visiting Montreal, but this place is a must. Damas might not be on every Where To Eat Right Now article.  It might not exude cool, and it might not be where you go to see and be seen.  What Damas does do though is get it’s food and it’s service very, very right.  Go here, be ready to be charmed by the staff and fall hard for the cuisine, and thank us afterwards.  Olive et GourmandoYou know how everyone says “Oh, Montreal!  It feels so European!”  While a large portion of Montreal really does feel this way, Old City is where it’s most apparent.  While you’re wandering this area, and you definitely should, make sure Olive et Gourmando is one of your stops along the way.   Dispatch CoffeeDispatch is in Mile Ex, one of those now coined “up and coming” areas that already has a palpable cool vibe very much running through its veins.  While the area is mostly desolate still, there are certainly a few spotted staple spots already spread throughout.  Dispatch Coffee and neighboring Manitoba Restaurant are some right at the center of the Mile Ex expansion.La DiperieLa Diperie does it differently.  There’s one flavor of soft serve ice cream; vanilla.  On top of that you pick a Belgian chocolate “dip” which acts as a base coat; choose from options like dark chocolate, green tea, apple pie, gingerbread, cinnamon and lemon poppyseed.  Next up are the toppings; sprinkles, pretzels, oreos, pistachios, coconut, you name it.  Just point, and watch your creation come to life.  "

With so many different activities to choose from and serious seasonality, you may find yourself wanting to visit Switzerland every month of the year!Visits in the spring and summer bring chances to attend large festivals, hike the once snow-capped peaks, or paraglide into a lovely pasture. While a visit during the winter means never-ending snow sports and endless cups of famous Swiss hot chocolate…yum!Determining the best time to visit Switzerland all depends on the activities that you’re wanting to partake in! If you’re not quite sure what you’re wanting to do or when would be best for you to venture to the land of chocolate and cheese, follow this guide to help you decide!Here are the best times to travel to Switzerland!April to JuneApril to June is one of the best times to visit Switzerland for multiple reasons: most of the winter snow has melted, the ski slope crowds have left, and the summer crowds have yet to arrive. This typically means cheaper accommodation and airfare!These months are best for avid hikers who want to see Switzerland covered in wildflowers, especially at Lake Lugano and Ronco Sopra Ascona. Come May, it’s also a wonderful time to try Swiss wine at one of the many local wineries who open their doors for locals and tourists alike. This practice is called “caves ouvertes” or open caves. In May there is also the famous art festival, Artisti di Strada, in Ascona. If you’re looking for more fun, head to Geneva in June for the Fête de la Musique.  July to AugustSummer in Switzerland is by far the country’s busiest season and the minute you arrive, you will understand why!The weather is sunny and ideal and the flowers are out in full force. Because conditions are so perfect and tourists flock overseas, prices can go up to 50% higher in the mountains. Don’t let this deter you—book in advance and you’ll likely snag a great deal.Summer also means the festival season for Switzerland! Switzerland’s biggest open-air music festival, Paleo in Nyon, and the world-famous Montreux Jazz Festival both take place in July. In August, Zurich is taken over by the Street Parade—a giant techno party. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?

November to MarchWinter in Switzerland is both high and low season. Quite the contradiction, right?Many of the resorts outside of the ski towns close down while the ski slopes are wide open and full of tourists riding the fresh powder. This is especially true around the holiday season when Christmas markets open up. Some of the most popular markets to head to are located in Montreux and Basel!Surprisingly, come January, temperatures drop more which brings more snowfall.This means it’s high season for skiers…but don’t fret if that’s not your thing! Spots like Ticino (near the Italian border), get little, if any, snow. You can also stick around to enjoy the International Balloon Festival in Chateau-d’Oex in January or enjoy the three day Fasnacht festival that takes place at the end of February and early March.

Many vacationers flock to this charming Swiss resort town because of its ample number of skiing and hiking areas.While many shy away from visiting Switzerland due to its high cost of living, Interlaken can be an affordable destination. Here’s how to travel Interlaken on a budget.Getting to InterlakenThe good news is that it’s fairly cheap to travel around the European Union.

The country has some decadent meals like fondue, rösti (fried potato patties) and saffron risotto among their common fare.I highly recommend trying a taste of everything when there. Here’s how to do it without maxing out your credit card.Use The Kitchen: Most hostels conveniently have fully equipped kitchens with pots, pans and everything else your chef heart desires. So, get your cooking hat on and get in there!It’s seriously one of the most straightforward ways to save cash. You can still try classic Swiss dishes, but perhaps with your own twist since you’ll be whipping up the meals yourself.If you’re a social butterfly, you can use cooking in the communal kitchen as an opportunity to meet new friends from around the globe!Be sure to buy some coffee from a convenience store, too. It is pricey in cafés, so get a head start by getting your coffee fix the affordable way.Pack Snacks: You can save a ton of cash by throwing a few bottles of waters and snacks into your bag. Look for healthy snacks at the grocery store to tide you over, so that you don’t get peckish around town.Check The Hotels: Prices at restaurants around Switzerland can be eye-wateringly high, so make sure that you get your francs worth when you go out. Typically, the best restaurants are in hotels.At least once during your trip, book a reservation in advance and treat yourself to something incredible.Switzerland is known for incredible fondue, which is a dish to be shared among new and old friends alike. It’s so good that many locals will have fondue (and fondue only) for their entire meal, so go out for some and split with others to make the meal cost next to nothing.A big thank you to Backpackers Villa for hosting me during my time in Interlaken.

https://theblondeabroad.com/top-ten-things-to-do-in-interlaken-in-the-winter/,Top Ten Things to Do in Interlaken in the Winter,Switzerland,"This post was written by Sivan, our Student Travel Expert Contributor!One of the most visually stunning cities in the world, Interlaken is an incredible place for a winter getaway. There is no shortage of experiences to have here, both above and below the mountain tops.While certain activities are only available in the summer, when the first snow falls a slew of opportunities open up for adventure. Outdoor Interlaken is the hub for adrenaline-inducing activities in Interlaken. They offer all types of tours of the town, guides for snow sports, and all the gear you could possibly need for your excursions. I filled my weekend with non-stop exploration and unforgettable experiences.Here are my top ten things to in Interlaken in the winter!Go Paragliding in InterlakenThere is nothing in this world like running off the top of a mountain at full speed and flying over snow-capped trees, shimmering lakes, and a little Swiss town. There are so many paragliding outlets in the city, but Outdoor Interlaken takes care of finding you the best one.After gathering the right gear and heading up to the top of a mountain, it was time to fly. With my guide behind me, I ran off the mountain and flew through the sky as I took in the sights of beautiful Interlaken.The pilot brought along a GoPro to capture the flight, and the photos were available for purchase after I viewed them.This was the most incredible experience and a must do when visiting Interlaken.Swiss Food and Culture TourSwitzerland is known for two great things: cheese and chocolate. The tour started at the Outdoor Interlaken shop where I met with my guide.Together, we wandered around the city and learned about the history of Interlaken and why these two delicacies are so important to the region.The first stop was a local cheese shop where I got to taste four different types of local cheeses (such a treat) and learn how they are made. Then we went to the Funky Chocolate Club where I got to try different types of chocolate and find out what each is used for.The Funky Chocolate Club also offers its own chocolate-making classes where you can hand make your own chocolate bar to take home!We continued through the town and learned about medieval Switzerland, traditional wood-carving, and all the bits that make Interlaken special. The last stop on the tour was at a local farm where I said hi to some happy cows and tasted their fresh milk and cheese.This tour was the perfect introduction to Interlaken and gave a great overview of this quaint town. Plus, who doesn’t love cheese and chocolate?The tour company also offers free walking tours and private customized tour of the area.Go Sky Diving in InterlakenIf you’re going to skydive, you might as well do it in Switzerland. Fly up in a plane with your professional guide, and take the ultimate leap of faith into the winter sky. You will see stunning mountains and landscapes the whole way down.Snow Sports Around InterlakenThe Swiss Alps are known for great skiing and snowboarding. Outdoor Interlaken offers packages for many different levels.You can rent all the gear you need at the shop so you don’t have to worry about traveling with it. Guides will take you up and down the mountain or send you off on your own depending on which package you choose.Snow ShoeingIf you want to get around the mountains but aren’t confident on skis or a snowboard, snow shoeing is a great alternative. The guides will give you all the gear and guidance you need to hike the snowy mountains and enjoy the outdoors.Boat CruiseThe city of Interlaken is sandwiched between two stunning lakes: Luke Thun and Lake Brienz. A boat cruise is the best way to see all the sights on the waters. Be sure to catch Oberhofen, the fairy-tale castle on the lake.Check out Lake Brienz with a mountain lake tour, and see beautiful cliffs, waterfalls, and magical villages. Starting in December, you can take a boat across Lake Brienz to the Christmas Markets.You can get a Day-Pass through Outdoor Interlaken, which allows you to take as many journeys as you like on scheduled boats. The boats depart from different points in Interlaken, and you can create your own hop-on hop-off day tour.Head Up to Jungfrau MountainKnown for being the highest point in Europe, this is one of the most popular day trips from town. It takes a bit of time and money to reach the top, but it is definitely worth the ultimate view.Play on the Vertical RushIf you are feeling low on adrenaline and need a little pick-me-up, head out to the Outdoor Interlaken’s Adventure Park in the tree tops. Free fall from the Giant Swing, take a leap on the BASE Jump Simulator, race along the fastest and longest zip line in Seilpark, and test your balance on the Highline.Visit Schilthorn MountainThis is a must-do excursion from Interlaken. Take a short train ride to Lauterbrunnen, hop on a cable car to Grütschalp, and then take the train to Mürren.From there, you can get a cable car to Birg and a connecting car to Schilthorn. The journey will give you the best views of the UNESCO World Heritage trio of the Elger, Mönch, and Jungfrau mountains.Grab lunch at the world’s first revolving restaurant, Piz Gloria, or check out the 007 James Bond exhibition dedicated to one of the movies that was filmed there.Night Sledding With FondueThere are still adventures to be had after the sun goes down. After gathering all the necessary gear from the Outdoor Interlaken shop, I hopped on a gondola and headed up to the top of a mountain.With guides in front and back of the group, we sledded on a carved-out trail all the way down the mountain. Sledding down a steep mountain under the night sky was an experience like no other.After we made it down the mountain, we were driven back to town and were seated at the restaurant in one of the oldest hotels in Interlaken. This restaurant is famous for its decadent cheese fondue. It was the perfect ending to a perfect night.A big thank you to Outdoor Interlaken for hosting me during my time in Interlaken.

So, I started looking into trains to Zurich. To my surprise, the capital of Switzerland is not Zurich. It’s Bern. And that’s where the embassy was located!Lesson learned: Don’t assume the biggest cities are the capitals!So my plans quickly changed and I hopped a train to Bern for a quick overnight stay and a hot date at the US embassy. To make the most of my visit to Bern, and my first time in Switzerland, I stayed at the Bellevue Palace Bern. This hotel alone is worth coming to Bern. It’s absolutely stunning.After checking into the hotel, I decided to stroll through town and discovered just how enchanting it was. The Old City is straight out of a storybook, surrounded by a turquoise river. A scenic walk up to the Rose Garden gives you a view over the Old Town- that looks just like a medieval city surrounded by a moat!Definitely, do not miss the sunset from the Rose Garden.I set my alarm the following morning before sunrise. It was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. I opened the french doors to my balcony and, wrapped in a blanket, sat to watch the sun paint the Alps in purple, pink and orange.After my appointment at the embassy, I had fresh new passport pages, a skip in my step and was ready to explore Bern for the rest of the morning until I had to leave for Basel. I took yet another tour around the Bellevue Palace before heading up to Altes Tramdepot for a pint with a view.If you’re visiting Switzerland, definitely make time to visit Bern and Old Town!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/ladylike-stay-bellevue-palace-bern/,A Ladylike Stay at Bellevue Palace Bern,Switzerland,"I firmly believe every woman needs to treat herself to a luxurious stay at a beautiful hotel somewhere special. Whether you go with a partner for some romance, with your best friend for a girlfriend getaway, or go solo to indulge in some “me time,” a stay at a luxury hotel can be a travel experience in itself.While traveling through Switzerland, I planned to take a train from Lucerne to Bern for an appointment with the US Embassy to get more pages added to my passport. To be honest, I had no idea what to expect in Bern and didn’t even realize it was the capital city of Switzerland.I was browsing hotels online when I came across the Bellevue Palace Bern. It was a gorgeous and historic hotel in the heart of Bern. But what particularly stood out to me was an entire section of their website dedicated to their female guests.Special Offerings for Female Guests Facial cleansing wipes, make-up, toiletries, hair spray, curling tongs, hair straighteners, silk stockings & tights, all available from the ConciergeYoga mats for hire from the ConciergeLow-fat dishes from the BELLEViE line, and gluten-free, lactose-free or low-salt dishes on requestConcierge collection service in the eveningSelection of women’s magazines in your room on requestSpecial offer from the Bellevue Bar: the Bellevue Lady Burger with only 125 g of meatUpon arriving, I was completely awestruck by the grandeur and beauty of the hotel. A stained glass ceiling flooded the foyer with natural light and the smell of fresh cut flowers tickled my nose.There was character and classic elegance in every detail. I was greeted with a 5-star smile and escorted to my room. Upon entering, I nearly shed a single tear of happiness. A selection of women’s magazines were spread out on my desk, including the latest issue of VOGUE!Across the room, a double-doored balcony led me to one of the most incredible views of any hotel I’ve ever stayed at. My gaze drifted over the River Aare to the distant Bernese Alps.It was breathtaking.My ladylike luxuries didn’t end there either. A small table was decorated with an assortment of treats including a bar of Swiss chocolate, chocolate covered peanuts and fresh fruit.Let me just say, heaven is a bar of Swiss chocolate with THAT view.Even though my stay in Bern was a short 24-hours, I spent the evening exploring the historic Old Town and falling head over heels in love with it. Bern is truly a city straight from a fairytale.I returned to Bellevue Palace for dinner and a cocktail in the Bellevue Bar before returning to my room for a bath. One of my favorite things about luxury hotels is the bathrooms; from the fluffy hotels to the little toiletries. Bellevue Palace took things a step further and even featured heated bathroom floors.I was tempted to sleep on the floor that night.After a long bubble bath, I decided against the bathroom floor and curled up in my fluffy bed. I woke up the next morning at sunrise to get an early start to my day, and I’m glad I did.I felt like a princess waking up to that view!I enjoyed a gorgeous breakfast on the hotel terrace with a view equally as beautiful as the one from my hotel room. Breakfast consisted of a variety of meats, cheeses, salmon, eggs and fresh squeezed juices. Yum!Everything from the food to the staff to my room at Bellevue Palace Bern was five-star. It’s amazing how strong of an impression a place can leave even in just 24-hours, but I had such a nice stay at Bellevue Palace that I would return to Bern just to stay here again.More InformationHotel: Bellevue Palace BernLocation: Bern, SwitzerlandAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$$Special thanks to Bellevue Palace Bern for hosting me as their guest. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-travel-to-china/,The Best Time to Travel to China,China,"Because the country of China is so large, there isn’t an exact, right time to visit — it’s a vast country with a wide range of climates. No matter what season or month you visit, you’ll be able to soak up every ounce of culture that China has to offer.When planning out your trip, think about the experiences you want to have and the areas you want to visit. Do you dream of walking along the Great Wall? Or experiencing the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival? If you’re torn, I’ve put together a breakdown of the tops festivals and seasons around the country.Here are the best times to visit China!   November to MarchMany people try to avoid China in the winter for the fear of it being too cold. And while it does get chilly (with highs in the mid-40s), there are a lot of places that are worth seeing. November and December are considered the low season, so it’s possible to save money on travel and accommodation.Visit spots like Hong Kong, Macau, Hainan, and Yunnan for warmer weather or experience China under a blanket of snow in cities like Beijing or Pingyao.Come January and February, events such as Chinese New Year, the Chinese Lantern Festival, and the Harbin Ice Festival fill the streets with people. With that comes higher price tags for travel—so I’d suggest booking in advance so you don’t get hit with last-minute fees!   Choi Hung Estate Basketball Court, Hong KongApril to MaySpring is arguably one of the best times to visit China, especially if you are a nature lover!Average temps range from 50 to 73 F, melting all the snow that winter brought. In the southern region, rain season begins…but don’t let than dampen your trip.The rain can actually enhance the views!Plus it brings out the blossoming flowers and fruit trees, painting the country with color. The best way to deal with the unpredictable weather is to wear light layers that are easily adaptable for the ever-changing climate. June to AugustJune through August is peak season in China, mostly because people are able to get the time off of work and school is out. However, this doesn’t mean that it is necessarily the best time to visit.Big cities like Beijing and Shanghai can get very humid and hot which can be downright uncomfortable.This is, however, the optimal time to visit the mountains and highlands such as Tibet. June is also the time of the Dragon Boat Festival where you’ll find locals snacking on rice dumplings and watching dragon boat races.Fun!   Hiking Mt. Huashan The World’s Most Dangerous TrailSeptember to OctoberOverall, fall is the best time to visit China in terms of the weather.There’s less rain, more sunshine, and milder temperatures. Because the weather is so great, many locals and expats alike visit different parts of the country yet international tourists don’t visit as often. If visiting, you’ll be met with fall hues and fresh local fruits.The biggest celebration of the fall season is the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. It’s celebrated in September or October on the 15th day of the 8th month of the Chinese lunar calendar (so this year, it’s on September 13, 2019!).The festival is symbolic of family reunion and harmony, and it’s celebrated with lots of good food and beautiful lanterns! OverallChina is a country full of rich culture, friendly locals, and food that will leave you seriously satisfied.Whether you want to explore the Great Wall of China or thrust yourself into the Chinese markets, you’ll be able to do so all year round. If you’re looking for the most ideal weather across the major cities and tourist sites, visit in the spring (April to May) or the fall (September to October).You’ll be met with mild temperatures and stunning scenery!  "

Hong Kong Museum of ArtYou Probably Don’t Need a VisaWhile Hong Kong is administered by China, it enjoys SAR status which means that some of the restrictions that apply on the mainland don’t apply in Hong Kong. So you probably won’t need a visa to visit if you’re coming from Western Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Americas!Always check visa requirements before booking your flights in case anything has changed for your nationality!Read More: How to Spend 48 Hours in Hong Kong Take the Star FerryThe Star Ferry is the fastest and cheapest way to travel between Kowloon and Hong Kong. With piers in Tsim Sha Tsui, Central and Wan Chai, it takes less than 10-minutes to cross.The iconic ferry has been operating since 1880 and offers spectacular views of the Hong Kong skyline and Victoria Harbour.The best advice? Don’t take it during rush hour. From 8 AM to 9:30 AM and 6 PM to 7 PM, locals are using it to get to and from work which makes the ride feel a whole lot less leisurely.Plus a one-way ride costs less than a dollar!  Visit the Choi Hung EstateThere’s a good chance you’ve seen Hong Kong’s famous Choi Hung Estate basketball court all over Instagram. It’s located in Choi Hung Estate which is one of the oldest public housing estates in the city.The only problem is that it’s not the easiest location to find.  The exact location is 2 Tse Wai Ave, Ngau Chi Wan, Hong Kong and I’d recommend using Google Maps to map a route from where you’re stayingRead More: How to Find Choi Hung Estate Basketball Court in Hong Kong Take the Airport ExpressThe easiest way to get to your hotel from the airport with the Airport Express train. It connects the airport to Hong Kong and Kowloon in under 25 minutes.Once you pass immigration at the airport, hop right on the train and make your way into the city.While you can buy tickets for the Airport Express at the airport, there’s usually a long line. Instead, buy them online from the MRT website.   Yum ChaTry Dim Sum in Hong KongHong Kong is home to delicious Michelin restaurants and street food. But what it’s most famous for is its traditional dim sum.It’s a Chinese dish that is served in a small steamer basket with a variety of fillings. My favorite spot in Hong Kong for gourmet dim sum is Yum Cha!Read More: Where to Find the Best Food in Hong Kong   Symphony of LightsSave Money With Hong Kong’s Free AttractionsIt’s no secret that Hong Kong is far from a budget travel destination. While accommodation is expensive, it’s possible to get by on a budget if you plan your itinerary around Hong Kong’s free attractions.You can explore Hong Kong’s art galleries, hike to Tai Long Wan, go on a free walking tour of the city, visit the many markets and watch the famous symphony of Lights!Read More: Top Free Things to Do in Hong Kong Learn Basic CantoneseWhile English is spoken in a lot of places in Hong Kong, you should still learn a bit of Cantonese before your trip. If you visit smaller corners of the city, the street-food workers won’t speak English and signs, and restaurant menus will be written in Cantonese.I’d also recommend writing any key phrases you need in Cantonese especially if you’re allergic to any ingredients or you’re following a restrictive diet. What to WearHong Kong is often humid and hot so you’ll want to pack a lot of light, breathable clothing options. You’ll also really want comfortable and supportive walking shoes.Surprisingly, Hong Kong is made up of a lot of hills, and if you’re doing a lot of sightseeing or shopping, you’ll want to be comfortable. It’s also a good idea to carry an umbrella with everywhere you go. The weather in Hong Kong can be extremely unpredictable and the city experiences over 100 days of rain a year. Get the Octopus CardThe prepaid Octopus card is handy for paying for any of the city’s public transportation options. Whether it be the MTR, a bus, the ferry, or the trams, you can easily tap the card as you go and avoid waiting in long lines for tickets.The best octopus card for travelers is the “On-Loan”  option. It requires a $50HK refundable deposit and you can buy one at the airport when you arrive or at any of the city’s MRT stations.    Stay in Hong Kong CentralIf you’re staying in Hong Kong for 48 hours or less, I recommend booking a hotel in the Central neighborhood. There’s so much to see and do that it’s easy to spend your entire time exploring the area.Shop at Mong Kok Ladies’ Market, try the local cuisine, ride the cities historic trams and end your day off with a cocktail at the NYC-inspired Please Don’t Tell.For those looking to splurge, I stayed at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Central! It’s an incredible five-star property that has a delicious on-site restaurant, bar and luxurious spa.

https://theblondeabroad.com/top-things-to-do-in-shaanxi-china/,"Top Things to Do in Shaanxi, China",China,"Shaanxi is the home of the emperor of the former Qin dynasty who united much of China for the first time. In fact, it’s considered to be one of the cradles of Chinese civilization.There’s so much history to see in this province. The capital is considered one of the four great ancient capitals of China!Within the city walls of Xi’an, you will find an abundance of history, delicious food, and plenty of shopping. Here are my top things to do in Shaanxi, China! Terracotta ArmyThe Terracotta Army aka the Terracotta Warriors and Horses is a large collection of life-size battle formations. Built by Qin Shi Huang, they were meant to protect his tomb and fight the battles in the afterlife.Although they date back to over 2,200 years ago, they were not found until 1974 when some farmers fell upon them accidentally. It’s said that there are currently 8,000 warriors, 160 chariots, and over 600 horses.There is a large portion of them yet to be uncovered and restored!Read More: Tips for Visiting the Terracotta Army in Xian TemplesChina is full of history and a huge part of that are the temples. Some of the favorites that I recommend going to are Daxingshan, Louguantai, and Xingjiao.Each one features beautiful and bold colors and incredible Chinese architecture dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. Giant Wild Goose PagodaThough its name is a bit funny, this ancient building is a holy place for Buddhists. Only 2.5 miles away from the town center, this pagoda is the most famous one in all of China.What makes it so unique is its structure. It was built completely of brick without the use of cement. It’s the perfect example of Chinese architecture. While visiting, try to stay for the music fountain. It’s the largest in Asia and contains a lighting system and professional audio system.Read More: How to Plan Your First Trip to China Xi’an City WallThe Xi’an Wall is guaranteed to impress. It’s the most complete city wall that has survived in China.It’s also the largest ancient military defensive system in the world. Because it is such a long wall, one of the most preferred ways to see it is to enjoy it on a bike ride.The cycle around the wall takes about 1.5 to 2 hours. If you would rather relax, they do offer sightseeing battery cars.They cost CNY 80 ($11 USD) for a circle ride while a more luxurious car costs CNY 120 ($17.45). Huaqing PalaceThis royal palace is unlike any other. Once having acted as a palace for Chinese dynastic rulers, it is now used as a natural hot spring.It’s been known for 6,000 years as a hot spring and 3,000 years for royal garden architecture. There are four spring heads and the water is not only suitable for baths and showers, but it’s also great for pain relief.The largest bath building can serve up to 400 people at a time. There are also multiple gardens that you can stroll around.While walking around, you’ll come across Nine Dragons Lake. What makes this lake so spectacular is the Song of Everlasting Sorrow.This live-action historical show features 300 professional actors, a 700-square-meter LED screen, and an underwater stage. It’s comparable to Cirque de Soleil! Great Mosque of Xi’anThe Muslims played an extremely important role in the unification of China and many mosques were built to honor them. The Great Mosque of Xi’an is the oldest, largest, and best-preserved mosque in China.It’s laid out like a traditional Chinese temple. It’s made up of 5 courtyards, each with a monumental pavilion or gate.From March to December, admission is CNY 25 ($4 USD). From December to February it’s CNY 15 ($2 USD). Its hours are currently 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The Drum TowerThe Drum Tower was originally used to signal the time, and occasionally as an alarm in emergency situations. Today the tower, built in 1380, is home of musical performances and a drum culture exhibition.In 1996, the government decided to remake the drum in the tower and replaced it with one that is 1.5 tons, making it the largest drum in China. When hit, it can be heard from up to 5 km away. The Bell TowerCovering an area of 1,377 square meters, the Bell Tower holds several large bronze-cast bells from the Tang Dynasty. Dark green tiles, blue and green paintings, and touches of gold adorn this famous structure.At the tower, there are six performances every day, each lasting about 10-15 minutes. It’s a show you won’t want to miss.I personally recommend going at night when both the Bell Tower and Drum Tower are brightly lit up and people are enjoying an evening walk. Tang ParadiseIf you’re looking to immerse yourself in Chinese culture, Tang Paradise is for you. The park is divided into many different areas with different cultural themes.Some of the areas are the Cultural Area of Songs and Dances, Area of Food Culture, Area of Folk Culture, Area of Female Culture, and more. I really enjoyed my visit, but some visitors feel that this is a sort of “Disneyland” for local culture.Everything is staged, but the performances and costumes are quite fun, so take it for what it is. Muslim StreetWhat would a trip to China be without sampling all of the incredible cuisines? Muslim Street is known as the main food street.The highlighted meals you’ll come across are roujiamo, marinated beef/lamb stuffed into a bun and yangrou paomo, pita bread that’s soaked in lamb soup. If you couldn’t tell, it’s a meat lover’s paradise so if you’re vegetarian or vegan, you might want to reconsider.Read More: Tips for Visiting Muslim Street in Xi’an China Foping National Nature ReserveThis nature reserve is known as the home of the Panda. How cool is that? When in China, you have to see some Pandas.Though, with the species being endangered, seeing the Chinese golden monkey is more common. Named for their golden hair, these little monkeys are highly prized.Their long fur makes them look like wings whenever they jump from tree to tree. Mount HuashanAt 2154m tall, Mount Huashan is considered to be one of 5 sacred mountains in China. It’s also known as one of the most dangerous and terrifying hikes in the world.The hike involves steep stairs, vertical ascents, and planks that you must cross. If you’re afraid of heights, looking at pictures alone will make your stomach drop.If you’re a brave soul, it’s an experience you will absolutely never forget.If hiking is not quite your speed, there are a few cable car rides that will take you to the North and West Peak. Depending on the ride you choose, it typically takes 7-20 minutes to reach the top.Read More: Hiking the World’s Most Dangerous Trail Hukou WaterfallThe Yellow River considered China’s “Mother River,” is the birthplace of ancient Chinese culture and the cradle of Chinese Civilization. On the Shaanxi side of the river, you can visit the Hukou Waterfall.The waterfall is so powerful you’ll feel the mist and strength of it even from a far distance! Which of these incredible sights has made it on your bucket list?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-the-terracotta-army-in-xian/,Tips for Visiting the Terracotta Army in Xi’an,China,"There’s a good chance that you’re familiar with the Terracotta Army in Xi’an. If you’ve ever taken a history class, you’ve most likely seen pictures of the statues in your books.The statues were built by the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty. He commissioned to have them constructed to protect his tomb and rule another empire in the afterlife.They’re considered the most significant archeological excavation of the 20th century. 3 farmers discovered the statues in 1974!If you’re interested in checking out one of China’s most prized possessions, read on for my tips on visiting the Terracotta Army in Xi’an!Getting ThereGetting to the warriors is relatively easy to do. Located one hour outside of the city in the Museum of Qin, you have 3 main options: bus, tour, or car.If you are looking to go independently, you can go to Xi’an’s main train station and take the green bus which will drop you off right outside the complex. The bus runs RMB7 ($1 USD) per person.If you don’t want to take the bus, you can opt to rent a taxi for the day. A taxi is only advisable if you’ve got a larger group or else it can get a bit pricey.If the taxi driver is left to wait around outside the complex (without having agreed to rent for the day beforehand), they are more likely to overcharge you on your ride home. Keep in mind that you can always bargain with a taxi driver when hiring one for the day.If you’d rather have a guided tour, you can choose to book one through your hotel or hostel. A tour will help guarantee that you have an English speaking guide!One of the most significant advantages of taking a tour is the fact that you’ll visit several other sights in the area as well. The tour also includes the old royal bath and temple.Warning: Your driver might try to get you to stop at souvenir shops because they have the chance to earn some extra commission on sales.There is a lot to see and do around town so if you have the chance; I’d recommend doing so. If you opt to go independently, be sure to grab a bike and explore the Xi’an wall, Muslim Street, and more.It’s worth it!The WarriorsThe museum is open from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM and it will cost you RMB150 ($21 USD) per person. This price includes entry to the vaults and museum, plus the documentary film of the warriors and their excavation.The museum contains three different pit areas organized by the order they were found. In the first pit, which is the largest, you will find the vanguard in 3 rows followed by an array of infantry and war chariots.The second pit includes more infantry, a crossbow team, calvary, and 80 chariots. The third pit was the command post of the armed forces, and it contains 68 warriors and a chariot led by 4 horses.Altogether it is estimated that there are currently 8,000 warriors, 130 chariots, and over 600 horses. The majority of them are still buried in the pits and have yet to be excavated and restored.When to GoDue to some of the experience being outside, the best time to visit is March through May or September through October as that’s when the weather is the best. If you’re looking to save a little money, the middle of November to the middle of March is low season, and the entrance fee is reduced.During peak times, the crowds can be huge so be prepared. Before 10:00 AM and lunch time tend to have fewer tourists which means you’ll be able to enjoy the museum at your own leisurely pace.This is such a special place to visit when you are in China, so be sure to add it to your itinerary!"

Far from any mansion, you have ever seen, this place is a world in itself.This massive complex is home to 4,000 people and sees a whopping 10,000 daily visitors.This bizarre complex is filled with everything from curry restaurants to African food stands.

Many elderly people walk around the perimeter, kids and their parents are using the space to play, and locals actually play basketball here.Shocker. As a tourist, remember this is their space. Imagine wanting to play a game of basketball with your friends but the court is crowded with people posing for pictures.Not awesome for kids that call this place home. So, again… be respectful.To avoid crowds of photographers, and to keep the space less crowded for locals, come early. This is a general rule for just about any popular attraction in the world.

https://theblondeabroad.com/american-airlines-flagship-business-class-from-hong-kong-to-lax/,American Airlines Flagship Business Class from Hong Kong to LAX,China,"Hong Kong is one of the most dynamic places on the planet. This vibrant city has a culture unlike anywhere else I have ever been (along with fantastic food!).While it’s a place that I think deserves a spot on every traveler’s bucket list, it is also incredibly far away. I’m talking around 13 hours in the air.Whenever I have a long haul flight, I think it is always worth upgrading to business class (remember always to keep saving those travel miles). On my recent trip from Hong Kong to California, I boarded American Airlines in Flagship Business Class!“Flagship” is the name of American Airline’s international Business class. Booking a Flagship Business class ticket allows you priority access throughout the airport (plus your bags will come out first at your destination!) and many other in-flight benefits.Want to fly home in style? Here is what you should know about American Airlines Flagship Business Class from Hong Kong to LAX.What to ExpectThe perks of American Airlines Flagship Business class starts when you arrive at the airport. Keep your eyes peeled for the “priority” signs at the American Airlines counter, at security, and at the gate.You can bypass the lines and make your time at the airport fly by a bit faster.If you have got some time to kill in the airport, it is worth finding the airline lounge. American Airlines has different lounge options depending on where you are flying from.In Hong Kong, you can use the Plaza Premium (West Hall) Lounge and Club Bauhinia. You can eat, drink, shower, relax, and get ready to continue on your journey.AmenitiesAA changes up their goodie bags every so often, but, at the moment, it’s Cole Haan amenity kits. They feature all of the essentials to keep you feeling fresh like an eye mask, earplugs, socks, tissues, toothbrush, toothpaste, pen, and a travel kit.One of the coolest new features of AA’s Flagship Business Class is the Casper bedding that is provided. Each seat gets a Casper mattress pad, duvet, pillow, pajama set, day blanket, lumbar pillow and slippers. The items were so cozy and above and beyond what I’d expect on a business class flight!EntertainmentThe Hong Kong to LAX trip on American Airlines is on a Boeing 777-300. The plane is equipped with Wi-Fi, live TV streaming, and hundreds of movies.There’s a good size screen and, with American Airlines Flagship Business class, you get Bose headphones (not the noise canceling kind though, so I’d still recommend bringing your own in the case that you’ve got noisy neighbors or like to use them to fall asleep).SeatingIn Flagship Business class, all seats are set up in a 1-2-1 configuration, so there is plenty of room to spread out. Every seat in AA Flagship Business class has a USB port, universal power plug, and a reading light.The seats lie fully-flat, which is always a must for flights this long. There is just the right amount of storage space around you so you will have plenty of room to stash away your essentials and spread out.For me, this is what makes all of the difference. While economy class is totally fine for short trips, it gets pretty miserable after eight hours (especially if you fly often!).Being able to lie down for a nap and spread my stuff out makes a world of difference when the journey is as long as Hong Kong to Los Angeles. Not only is my trip better, but getting some much needed zzz’s also means that I can arrive refreshed and not lose any travel days.Food + DrinkOn the way from Hong Kong to Los Angeles, American Airlines offers three meals throughout the flight. They also have a snack station you can pop up at any time to hydrate and refuel.Their menu for each meal includes a starter, salad, main, and a dessert. You will have the choice between four entrées and, of course, you will want to contact them in advance if you have any dietary restrictions.Just log into their site at least 24 hours before you go and they will make accommodations to offer you a meal that suits your diet.HELPFUL TIP: If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card.My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-the-landmark-mandarin-oriental-in-hong-kong/,Staying at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong,China,"An urban wonderland, there’s nothing quite like exploring the vibrant streets of Hong Kong. Located beside southeastern China, this place is an intriguing blend of Chinese and British culture with a unique Hongkonger vibe. When you’re staying in Hong Kong, the Central business district is a prime location. On my recent trip there, I stayed in the heart of it all at The Landmark MO. Here’s what it’s like staying at The Landmark Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong!The HotelThe Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong offers 111 guestrooms on 15 floors in a five-star property in Hong Kong Central. One of the prime features of The Landmark Mandarin Oriental is its location. In the heart of the Central neighborhood, it’s easy to hop on the metro from the hotel and get anywhere in Hong Kong. The RoomsThere’s a beautiful range of room options here. The L600 Deluxe offers a separate living room area and a spa-like bathroom. While if you’re looking for a larger space, the L600 Premier and L600 Executive are lovely upgrades. The L900 Landmark Suite is a glam one-bedroom suite, while the Apartment Suite is a VIP option. Having a shindig in Hong Kong? The Entertainment Suite was made for swanky get-togethers. I actually had the chance to experience two rooms. When I first checked in, I was in the L600 Deluxe, which had a boutique-hotel feel. It was easily one of the most strikingly designed luxury rooms I’ve ever stayed in, and I was obsessed with the macaroon fridge! During my stay, I was upgraded to the Apartment Suite. Like the L600 Deluxe, the suite featured a deluxe seven-foot round bath with a rainforest shower. At 1,184 square feet, the Apartment Suite is a major upgrade in terms of size. However, even at 603 square feet, the L600 Deluxe felt cozy rather than cramped thanks to its sleek design. One thoughtful touch that the hotel provided for in both rooms was the nightly gift. Every evening, you receive a turndown service, and they leave a little surprise on the pillow. One evening I received a foot spray and, on another night, I got a facial sheet mask.The FoodOMG, the food. The Landmark Mandarin Oriental features a two-star Michelin-rated restaurant, Amber. I tried their four-course degustation lunch, and it was absolutely delicious. Even if you don’t stay at the hotel, I couldn’t recommend eating at Amber enough! Amber has a classic French menu with options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. For late night cocktails, there’s the PDT (Please Don’t Tell) New York cocktail bar.  For all-day dining and after dinner drinks, there’s also the swanky MO Bar on site.SustainabilityYou don’t often hear much about green living at luxury hotels, so it was a breath of fresh air to hear about The Landmark Mandarin Oriental’s efforts toward sustainability. They’re on a mission to reduce waste and go plastic-free.They have moved from plastic to bamboo straws. They filter their own water throughout the entire hotel and they serve it in reusable glass bottles available in all guest rooms and suites. To make matters greener, PDT and MO were constructed using reconditioned and recyclable materials. The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong is well-known for its wellness programs and integrating sustainable efforts as a seamless part of the guest experience. They’re always working with local charity initiatives to make the hotel greener, so expect more changes soon. ActivitiesIn the middle of the Central district, there’s a whole world at the doorstep here. The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong is located on Queen’s Road Central, which is one of the city’s most historic and happening streets. When you need a retail fix, The Landmark Mandarin Oriental is actually connected to the best shopping in the city at the Landmark. For culture vultures, there are galleries galore and, if you’re lucky enough to be there in March, don’t miss one of the world’s biggest art fairs at Art Basel Hong Kong. Ready to get out of town?

https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-hong-kong/,Where to Find the Best Food in Hong Kong,China,"Hong Kong.  It’s a big, bustling, brimming with options kind of city. It is made up of two different sides; one being Kowloon and the other called Central, divided by Victoria Harbour.Kowloon has over 2.1 million people living in an area that is not all that big and is the side that many might call the “real” portion of the city, escaping many of the influences that the British colonization had across the water.  It’s gritty and it’s interesting and it’s worth going to.Central, or Hong Kong Island as it’s otherwise known as is also highly populated at almost 1.3 million people, but the westernized impact can be felt much more tangible here.  Turn the right corner and you’ll even find streets reminiscent of parts of Brooklyn, or London.Hong Kong also has a stunningly gorgeous and much softer side, too.  Take a bus up and around the mountain and you won’t believe the landscape that folds out in front of you; it’s absolutely breathtaking.Spending time in all parts of Hong Kong will do you good, and will give you the best feel for all that this high energy city has to offer.As you’re exploring, here are some of the best places and best food in Hong Kong to try! YardbirdYardbird is one of my favorite meals I have ever had- in the entire world.  Chef Matt Abergel of famed Masa in NYC and Lindsay Jang, who happened to be sitting next to me as I ate and served me sake by the time the dinner was up, started in New York and used their experience to open an uber cool, super fun, highly creative yakitori spot in the trendy Sheung Wan area. The fried sweet corn tempura and “KFC” cauliflower with yuzu and chill were unforgettable, and the night and vibe were just fun. Yardbird is a total winner. Butao RamenThis is a “make your own” ramen haunt in a hole in the wall room.  Here you’ll grab a pencil, check what you want off a long list of options like soup infusions, garlic levels, oil source (light, normal, heavy, super heavy), toppings (tree mushrooms, seaweed, egg), even texture of noodles (super soft, soft, normal, hard, super hard).On my tab: garlic infused soup with spring onions, mushrooms, and egg, with firm noodles. There’s a long line out the door here, so be ready to wait.Shek O Chinese & Thailand SeafoodWhen you get yourself to the back side of the island, where there are those stunning views I was talking about before as well as surfer haunts like Big Wave beach, stop for a moment at Shek O Chinese & Thailand Seafood while you’re at it.Totally bare bones, with an extremely simple and casual set up in the village of Shek O, it’s a very different experience and also one worth having.    Tim Ho WanTim Ho Wan is the cheapest Michelin star in the world.  It’s also located in a train station’s lower level.  The food did not blow me away, but that combination was intriguing and unique enough to get me there. RoninDinner at Ronin, owned by the Yardbird power crew, was special.  I was lucky enough to be sent here by Lindsay Jang and friends after conversations I had with them on that first night at Yardbird, which was pretty amazing luck as a seat can be extremely hard to come by.There are just 14 spots along the bar and then another couple of standing places parallel (it’s a narrow and long restaurant).  The vibe is uber chic and sophisticated and is more reminiscent of a whiskey bar than a proper restaurant.The small menu boasts options like uni nori, turbot, fried baby crabs, walnut and pomegranate salad, and honey glazed fish.  Beware, Ronin is quite pricey!Grassroots PantryRolling on with that ex-pat theme, Grassroots Pantry is certainly popular with visitors, but also equally so with locals.  One glance at the menu and the space and you’ll know for sure that food trends are not contained to only certain cities, or countries.Go here for lemon chia pancakes, quinoa porridge and granola with coconut yogurt and hemp.  You get it. TeakhaTeakha’s got that ex-pat vibe we often crave and shows a nice side of the more “hipster” side of the city. Go here for breakfast and indulge in an egg sandwich on Hong Kong’s famous pineapple bun.Afterwards, be sure to walk it off with a wander around these charming and interesting back streets.Chom ChomCasual Chom Chom is set on a busy corner of the Soho area of Central.  Its thing is Vietnamese food and it does its thing quite well.Chom Chom is a great place to gather with friends, drink some beer and devour all those things you never mind having; salt and black pepper squid, Vietnamese fried chicken wings, caramel black cod, and sriracha grilled corn.Read more about Kate’s foodie experiences in Hong Kong!"

I found the locals to be friendly, accommodating, and quite curious as to what a tall, blonde girl was doing roaming the streets of their remote cities!Shaanxi is also home to the Terracotta Army, a collection of terracotta warriors and horses sculpted to depict the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It was such an overwhelming sight to see, and something that I got to (excitedly) check off my bucket list.With activities from visiting the Muslim Street market, to riding bikes through Xi’an, to hiking the deadliest trail in the world…China will always be an unforgettable travel experience!"

The street has a long history, dating back over 1,000 years and is the hub of the Muslim community in the city. The market is famous for delicious food and trendy products.I spent some time exploring the markets and was introduced to new foods, local trends, and friendly locals.Check out my guide to visiting the Muslim Street market in Xi’an!The LowdownMuslim Street is a historic market road in Xi’an, China that dates back more than 1,000 years! For centuries, merchants, students, and travelers made their way here on the famous Silk Road from Persia, Arabia, and Central Asia to trade their wares and knowledge in this ancient Chinese city.Some settled here, and their descendants—the Hui people, a Muslim ethnic minority—still sell their treats and souvenirs along this long street paved with blue-gray flagstones.Exploring the market will take you down two main streets, which together form an L shape. If you’re taking your time, the walk will take you about one and a half hours so bring some water and good walking shoes.You won’t get too hungry though—there’s a myriad of snacks and treats to grab along the way.The FoodLocals and tourists flock to the Muslim Quarter of Xi’an to try the distinctive snacks. Since the vendors are devout Muslims like their ancestors, that means there is no pork!You’ll also find no alcohol here as it is forbidden in Islamic dogma. Food stalls and restaurants are packed with cakes, dried fruits, barbecued meats, breads, and candies.Be sure to try the local specialties like roujiamo (marinated beef or lamb in a wheat bun) and yangrou paomo (pita bread soaked in lamb soup). Als,o try the persimmon fruit pies and the fried rice with pickled cabbage and capsicum.There are soup dumplings served with red chili, spicy Sichuan pepper, bean threads, and cold noodles—perfect in the summer!Don’t leave without sampling a bit of handmade Biang Biang noodles, which are known for their thickness. Food stalls will stretch the noodles and slam them onto tables creating the biang biang sound from which the noodles get their name.The ArchitectureCheck out the cool buildings here; some date back centuries. There are the Hanguang Gate from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the Niching Gate Tower Cluster of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), the Taoist City God Temple, and the Grand Mosque.The sheer diversity of buildings speaks volumes about the history of Xi’an as a major cultural crossroad.The SouvenirsThe Muslim Street is a great place to pick up your souvenirs and offers a wide range to choose from. You’ll want to stop by the Xibeilou or Jiayongxin souvenir stores while you’re there—this is the definitive place to pick up your miniature terracotta warrior to take home!How to Get to Muslim Street MarketWalk from the Xi’an City Wall along South Street for fifteen to twenty minutes and follow the Xi’an Bell Tower and Drum Tower to the entrance of the Muslim Quarter."

There are five peaks, each with its own attractive details: East Peak is best for the sunrise, the South for the highest altitude, North for its terrace, West for its elegance, and Middle Peak, also known as Jade Lady Peak.Three different routes lead to the North Peak which is the lowest of the five peaks. The most popular trail is now known as “The Intelligent Take-over Route of Hua Shan,” and was fixed up in 2000 and has the most traditional, historical roots. There is also a cable car line built along this trail, with a second cable car line going up to the West Peak.From the North Peak, a series of paths rise up more than 984 ft. on the side of the mountain. This was the only trail to go to the four other peaks—Plankwalk in the Sky— and is deemed one of the world’s deadliest hikes.Here is what I learned hiking the world’s most dangerous trail at Mt. Huashan!Getting ThereThe mountain is about 75 miles from Xi’an—catch a high-speed train, normal train, or a bus from Xi’an Railway Station. There are green minibuses that pick you up from the Huashan North Station and drive you to the mountain for free.One entrance ticket will get you into the peak’s scenic area as well as the Xiyue and Jade Spring Temples. Make sure to travel there in late spring or early fall for the best weather and views!Hiking the Plankwalk in the SkyThe infamous Plankwalk in the Sky is one of the deadliest trails known to man. Travelers make their way through narrow walkways and crumbling staircases up nearly 7,000 feet to the summit.This experience is not for the physically challenged or the faint of heart! You are fitted with a safety harness and two carabiners that clip you onto a thin safety wire that runs along the hike. Be prepared for narrow and wobbly paths, squeezing space, and insane heights!So what exactly makes it dangerous? It isn’t the sheer slopes or the small wooden planks, which are the only things preventing you from falling to a violent death thousands of feet below.The scariest part is the traffic!Mt. Huashan is such a popular destination that there will likely be an insane amount of people crossing at the same time as you. You’re forced to keep your balance on a small path that somehow accommodates two-way traffic.The fun just gets better when excited tourists unclip BOTH their carabiners to get around you quicker—or even when they unclip YOUR carabiners so you can pass them easier (what helpful neighbors!). Whatever you do, the important thing is to remain calm and not be pressured by other hikers.You can try to avoid the majority of crowds by attempting a night hike. Believe it or not, this is still a popular option for those who want to catch the legendary sunrise from East Peak.      Cable CarsIf you don’t fancy a dangerous hike, catch a cable car from Wamiaogou directly to the North Peak (seven to eight minutes). You can also jump on a second car from Donggoukou to West Peak (20 minutes), and hike a simple 30 to 40 minutes to reach South Peak.A shorter walk from the West Peak will lead you to a small cave—nothing much to see—and have you back in about 30 minutes. Mount Huashan TemplesMount Huashan is home to over 20 Taoist temples. Its religious significance make it one of China’s five most sacred mountains.Once you’ve reached the top of Mount Huashan, you can visit the Yuquan Garden, Dongdao Courtyard and Zhenyue Hall temples. Each is listed as main Taoist temples in China and are some of the most popular temples to visit at the summit.Mount Huashan is also a beautiful part of China to explore. Give yourself time to explore and soak up all the natural beauty before heading back down!     OverallHiking Mount Huashan was an incredible experience and a highlight of my trip to China! If you have the chance to conquer the mountain, whether it’s by cable car or along the hiking routes, I definitely recommend it! Do you have any tips for hiking Mount Huashan?

https://theblondeabroad.com/five-things-to-do-in-xian-china/,"Five Things to do in Xi’an, China",China,"No trip to inland China would be complete without a few days in Xi’an. As the former capital, Xi’an still draws travelers every year to glimpse its star archaeological attractions. The atmosphere is decidedly more archaic and authentic than bustling metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai.There’s plenty to see and do here—from ancient architecture like the Bell Tower, Drum Tower, and Wild Goose Pagodas to natural sites like Mount Huashan and the Huaqing Hot Springs.Here are 5 things to do in Xi’an, China!Terracotta ArmyA stop in Xi’an wouldn’t be complete without seeing the Terracotta Army, also known as “Terracotta Warriors and Horses”. Buried and forgotten for nearly 2,000 years, the collection of more than 8,000 life-size figures of warriors, chariots, horses, and acrobats was built to safeguard Emperor Qin Shi Huang (260-210 BCE) in the afterlife.It was only rediscovered in 1974 and has since been dubbed a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an eighth wonder of the world.Muslim Street MarketLocated in the Muslim district of Xi’an, the Beiyuanmen is an impressive stretch of Middle Eastern souvenirs and tasty food. The street runs about 550 yards north of the Drum Tower and is said to be one of the main starting points of the Silk Road.Chinese referred to the Arab and Persian merchants who settled in the area as Hui people, and their descendants still sell their wares along the street.Nowadays, you can stroll along the long, peaceful promenade while checking out the snack vendors’ fresh and fried delights. Try some of the local favorites like lamb skewers, dates, gravy-filled dumplings, and flat bread soaked in mutton.Read More: Tips for Visiting Muslim Street in Xi’an ChinaSee a PerformanceIf you’re in Xi’an between April and October, I recommend catching a performance of The Song of Everlasting Sorrow. You can take a free shuttle from the railway station to Mount Lichen.This historical drama, adapted from a T’ang-era poem, is performed twice an evening at Huaqing Hot Springs just below Lishan Mountain. The performance is a large-scale event of music, dance, lights, and costumes against a backdrop of ponds, willow trees, pavilions, and palaces.One of the more dramatic of Chinese laments, it is a tragic love story of T’ang Emperor Xuanzong (685-782) and his beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan. Tickets are available at the Tourist Service Center at Xi’an North Railway Station.Ancient City WallXi’an has the best preserved ancient city walls in China. Built in the T’ang Dynasty in 1370, they stand nearly 40 feet high and are an outstanding length of more than eight and a half miles.I definitely suggest hopping on a rental bike and cycling two to three hours on the circumference.The ride is fairly simple and effortless, but be sure you bring something to drink as the street vendors are few and far between. If you’re lucky, you may catch the Changing of the Guard, which takes place three times a day at the south gate.Mount HuashanIf you’re in need of a break from the city, take a train or long-distance bus out to Mount Huashan. The mountain, which stands more than 6,500 feet high, lies about 75 miles east of Xi’an and is one of Taoism’s Five Great Mountains. Huashan is a beautiful cluster of five peaks with dramatic and breathtaking cliff faces. It is one of the most dangerous hiking trails in the world because of its steepness and narrow passes.The risk is doubled in the summer because of the sheer number of people trying to make the ascent at the same time.Read More: Hiking the World’s Most Dangerous Trail"
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-plan-your-first-trip-to-china/,How to Plan Your First Trip to China,China,"Americans can get quite a culture shock visiting China for the first time. With different customs and languages, and hassles like visas and censorship- it’s no wonder why. Stay informed and you’ll have a great first trip to China.Here are my tips to planning your first trip to China!Where Do You Want to Go?With a country as vast and diverse as China, it’s important to narrow your focus and to set your priorities and plan your route before you go.How long do you have? One week? Focus on the metropolises of Beijing and Shanghai. A bit longer? Delve into the traditional heart of China, in Xi’an or Guilin!Apply for a VisaU.S. citizens are required to obtain a visa before they arrive in China. You must submit a visa application, the $130 visa fee, a roundtrip flight itinerary, a passport (valid for at least six months), and a passport photograph to the nearest embassy or consulate.It can take up to two months to process your visa, so make sure to get all your documents sent in, well in advance. Use a visa-handling service to eliminate delays or undue stress.Helpful Tip: If you intend to travel to Hong Kong or Macau, you’ll need a multiple- entry visa into China.Know Your LimitsEven with a visa, access to many areas of China is still forbidden by law. You’ll need a special permit if you intend to visit Tibet, for example. You can visit Macau and Hong Kong visa-free up to at least a month, though!Book Your AccommodationBefore you leave, be sure to book your accommodation for at least for the first three days of your stay! The China visa application requires the address of where you’re staying. If you will be at a hotel, include your room confirmation; if you’re staying with friends or relatives, include their address on the form.Practice the LanguageMany younger Chinese do speak English, but there’s a fair-sized  population who that doesn’t! Learn a few words to break the ice with the locals.Mandarin is the default language in most parts of China, so try to pick up the basics- nihao (hello/goodbye), xiexie (thank you), dui buqi (sorry), ganbei (cheers)- and try them out at a restaurant, on the street asking for directions, or in a taxicab!Bargaining in ChinaBargaining: People either love it or hate it and in China- it’s the former. Haggling is acceptable in most Chinese stores, with the exception of the supermarket and shopping malls. First, check out several shops to get a general idea about average prices, then pick a shop to test your skills.Stay relaxed but always polite!Some tips I picked up were to look disinterested, point out flaws in the product, dress in plain clothes to make sway vendors into lowering their product price. Even walking away- this will catch most people’s attention!Bargaining is a big difference from Western culture, that’s for sure!Prepare to Be CensoredAmericans aren’t used to censorship, so you may be surprised when you can’t access sites like Facebook, Twitter, or even your email at times. If it’s an issue for you, be sure to get a VPN on your devices before leaving the U.S.!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Using a VPN When TravelingDelve into Chinese CuisineChinese food can be strange and unfamiliar, but this shouldn’t stop you from exploring the sundry and succulent world of local cuisine! The food of each region has its distinct flavor- in Shanghai they’re obsessed with dumplings, and the spiciest dishes hail from Sichuan province.For a real treat, try local delicacies like bee pupa! "

But it can be quite the culture shock on your first trip! Sometime during your visit, you’ll have to deal with smog, chopsticks, and government bureaucracy. Just stay informed and be prepared, and you’ll have a stress-free vacation.Here are my top tips for your first trip to China!Plan in Advance for a VisaChina requires visitors from most countries to have an entry visa. It’s best to prepare your application at least two months prior to your trip. Americans must submit an application, a $130 fee, your passport, and your flight itinerary to the nearest embassy or Consulate General.It’s best to go through a travel agency or visa service that can guarantee prompt delivery.Read More:The Ultimate China GuideHow to Plan Your First Trip to China20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit China    When to Visit ChinaChina in the summer is smoggy and sweltering, and the humidity can be unbearable, but both Chinese and foreign tourists use their precious vacation days in the summer to swarm touristy highlights. Consider visiting China in the off-season, late October to March, for fewer crowds and cooler temperatures.I went in October (to the Shaanxi region) then again in June (to the Quinghai region) and both were amazing experiences! Read More:The Ultimate Asia Travel GuideThe Best Time to Travel to China   Where to VisitFor your first trip to China, the most recommended tourist destinations are Beijing, Shanghai, Xi’an, and Guilin. Different regions have different weather conditions, and attractions throughout the year, so make sure to check ahead of time!I visited Xi’an and the Shaanxi Region and was blown away by the hospitality of the locals and the wonderful cultural attractions they have. The highlight was seeing the Terra Cotta Army and climbing and exploring Mt. Huashan.For a unique and more remote experience in China, you can visit the Qinghai region. With stunning landscapes, beautiful lakes and even mountain ranges, it’s a sparsely populated destination perfect for nature lovers. It borders Tibet and has a population of 1 yak to every person!Read More:Five Things to Do in Xi'an, ChinaTop Things to Do in Shaanxi, ChinaTips for Visiting Muslim Street in Xi'an, China LanguageThe language barrier is the number one hurdle to overcome for a foreigner when traveling to China, so it can be helpful to learn a few phrases in the language. China has two major languages, Mandarin and Cantonese (spoken mostly in Hong Kong).While English is slowly becoming universal, especially in the cities, many Chinese people cannot speak it. I suggest keeping a business card from your hotel to show to taxi drivers or in case you get lost while exploring. CensorshipThe Chinese government censors everything from media to the internet, so you will be unable to access sites like Facebook and Twitter.It is safe to assume that you won’t be able to access your favorite sites or even email at times. If this is a big issue for you (like it was for me!) make sure to get a VPN on your phone and computer before leaving—just make sure that the service provider is not blocked in China.I used ExpressVPN on both my computer and iPhone and had internet throughout my trip!    Culture ShockChinese lifestyles are very different than most Westerners, so try to read up on traditions and etiquettes practiced in the region you are traveling before you go.In large cities, China experiences heavy traffic and pollution, and many people wear surgical masks to protect their lungs. Prepare for the toilets—many are squat toilets without any paper. I suggest bringing your own paper and hand sanitizer along with you!When it comes to street vendors, it is perfectly acceptable to negotiate prices. That being said, if you are not planning to buy anything, do not ask about price, because if you do the vendors may follow you around for a bit.Being confident and kind will get you a long way! You May Be the Tourist AttractionBe aware that outside of the main cities like Beijing and Shanghai, the locals are not used to seeing Westerners. You may find that people stare at you and even take photos of you – smile pretty!Don’t take it personally, as most people are just curious. Be polite to strangers, but, like everywhere, keep your wits and street smarts in your back pocket. Staying HealthyPollution is a real problem in China, especially if you have respiratory health problems. If you are sensitive to the air, try to stay out of the big cities, or wear a mask to help.Drink only bottled water and boiled tea!Also, my biggest tip is to be wary when trying the street food—you may encounter stale oil or old leftovers. While I’m a huge advocate for trying local foods while traveling, make sure to bring some Imodium, as your stomach may not agree with some of the traditional cuisines. Staying Safe in ChinaIn general, Chinese people have a favorable opinion of Westerners, and crime against foreigners is extremely rare in China. As with any big city, the risk of pickpocketing is a possibility but, besides that, the worse that may happen is that you are over-charged for items from street vendors.Just stay aware of your surroundings, don’t get drunk in public, and count your change—it’s not rude in China.

https://theblondeabroad.com/avianca-787-business-class-flight-from-la-to-bogota/,Avianca 787 Business Class Flight from LA to Bogotá,Colombia,"When on a long flight, comfort is extremely important. Avianca, a Columbia-based airline and also one of the oldest airlines in the world, launched its business class seats on board it’s 787 Dreamliners a few years ago.I knew this meant that I had to try it out on my recent trip from LAX to Bogota.

With a Caribbean and Pacific coastline, the Andes Mountains, La Guajira Desert, and the Amazon Jungle, this South American gem has got it all. I recently had my first chance to visit Colombia and totally fell in love with it. One of the highlights of my trip was staying at Bogotá’s chicest new hot spot.Here’s my experience staying at the Click Clack Hotel in Bogotá!– The Hotel –Located in the trendy El Chicó neighborhood, this cool and quirky designer spot is not your average boutique hotel. Every inch of this place has been designed to enhance your experience and give you amazing surprises at every turn.I just loved the modern and chic atmosphere that is evident throughout the whole property!The impressive rooftop bar and playful design aesthetic will make you feel like a trendy jet-setter even when you are just lounging around in your PJs.– The Rooms –There are sixty rooms in the Click Clack that come in XS, S, M, L, and XL so you can decide which option works best for your stay.

There’s ample space for all of the luggage that you’ll need when you’re traveling to the other side of the world.The rooms also have lots of desk space, which is always a major perk when you are working on the go.The amazing floor-to-ceiling windows are the most striking thing about the room.

At the in-house eatery, Ciengramos, you can eat from a flower pot, and then grab a drink named after your favorite artist at the art cocktail apothecary.Always a bonus, there are tons of great veggie picks here.For a mouthwatering burger and a jaw-dropping view, head up to the rooftop burger bar, Apache.

From Wednesday to Saturday, there’s a live DJ in the house spinning everything from house music to throwback hits.– Activities –One of the best things about the Click Clack Hotel in Bogotá is its location.

These days, Bogotá is a safe and forward-thinking city that is trending with global adventurers.If you only have 48 hours in Bogotá, there are some sights you have to hit.With a rich history and a promising future, Bogotá is a fascinating place to be right now. And it’s so much bigger than you think! With a metro population of nearly ten million people, the city dwarfs most American and European cities.Here’s how to experience the best of the best with 48 hours in Bogotá!Travel Tips for BogotáFlightsAvianca Airlines provides some of the best direct flight options into Bogotá from the US and Europe.Getting to TownEl Dorado Airport is about nine miles west of the city center. You can grab an official airport taxi (yellow and white) for the quickest ride into town– taking around 20 minutes and costing approximately 15,000 Colombian pesos (about $5 USD). I highly recommend using UBER or your hotel transfers for transportation around the city.LanguageThe official language of Colombia is Spanish.Where to StayI stayed at the ultracool Click Clack Hotel. Set in the heart of the chic Park 93 neighborhood, this place is a prime example of the innovative design and hip aesthetic of Colombia’s up-and-coming crowd.Currency1 Colombian Peso equals 0.00034 USD, so you’re looking at around 3,000 pesos to the dollar.Credit Cards and BanksCredit cards are widely accepted throughout Bogotá, but I’d recommend taking out cash from local ATM’s if you plan to do some shopping in the markets. For safety, be sure to use a secure ATM located inside a bank.ClimateMarch is the hottest month in Bogota with an average temperature around 70°F, and the coldest is December at 55°F. The climate is very warm and tropical, with a rainy season from May to November, and October wettest on average. Day OneIf you’ve only got 48 hours to explore Bogotá, you’ll want to start with the top spots and try to pack as much as you can into each day. Here are a few things you absolutely must-see.The Gold MuseumOne of Colombia’s most visited attractions, this museum is home to 55,000 gold artifacts from the pre-Spanish days of South America. With bling spread over three floors, this place is truly incredible.The Artisan MarketsCome ready to haggle! There are great markets all over Bogotá, and they are the best places to get a souvenir. Be sure to check out the woven bags in the Usaquén market! They are handmade and famous across the region. (Helpful Tip: Bags are priced differently based on the quality of their weave, but 60k to 70k is a fair price to aim for on a nice bag)Lunch at La Puerta FalsaOnce you’ve worked up an appetite, grab some traditional Colombian fare at La Puerta Falsa. The restaurant is packed tight with patrons, and there are only two items on the lunch menu: tamales or ajiaco soup. I definitely recommend ajiaco — a savory and creamy soup with potato, avocado, capers, cream and corn on the cob!Stroll Street Vendors in La CandelariaThis is the best neighborhood for exploring. Always buzzing, the historical La Candelaria is a blend of Spanish colonial, art deco, and Baroque buildings. Plan on at least a couple of hours to wander around and see all of the vendors.Bolivar SquareSurrounded by gorgeous architecture, Bolivar Square is one of Bogotá’s most iconic sites. It is a favorite among locals and tourists alike. The most famous visitors to the square, however, are the birds. Buy some corn from one of the vendors walking around the square so you can feed them.Sunset Cocktails at Apache Rooftop Bar at Click ClackFor a bird’s eye view of Bogotá, get to the top of the Click Clack Hotel. Bring your camera and chill out with a cocktail while you watch the sunset over the city.  Day TwoOn your second day, be sure to climb to the top of the city and mix with the locals for insight into life in Colombia’s capital!MonserrateNo matter where you are in the city, you can see the iconic Monserrate Mountain. A Colombian spiritual and cultural symbol, this must-see attraction is something you’ll want to spend the morning taking in. Ride the funicular or the cable car up the mountain for a panoramic view of Bogotá and beyond.Lunch at Club ColombiaFor some of the best South American food you’ll ever try, you have got to get to Club Colombia. The dishes are hearty, so come hungry. The Arepa de Choclo is especially delicious here.Bogotá Graffiti TourTwice a day, there is an impressive tour starting at the Parque de Los Periodistas. Lasting for two and a half hours, the Bogotá Graffiti tour will let you see the city like a local while you take in the striking street art. Book your spot before you go!Night Out in Chia at Andres Carne de ResIf you’re in Bogotá on a Friday or Saturday night, you’re in luck!

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-cuba/,10 Local Foods to Try in Cuba,Cuba,"A unique blend of African, Spanish, and Caribbean influences, Cuba has some of the best food in the world. The cuisine of Cuba reflects the island’s rich and dynamic history. The Spanish colonial influences are obvious, but it’s not exactly the food you would find in Madrid either.French colonists over from Haiti and slaves from Africa brought their own culinary influences. On an island offering ultra-fresh seafood and sweet fruits straight from the vine, the diverse people of Cuba created flavors all their own.Let’s dive into Cuban cuisine!Where to Find the Best Cuban FoodBefore we can talk about what to eat in Cuba, let’s talk about where to eat. The restaurants in Cuba aren’t necessarily what you would expect. Before you go, you’ll want to have an idea of the different types of options: state-run restaurants, paladares, casas particulares, and good old fashioned street food.Government-Run RestaurantsAs soon as you start looking for food in Cuba, you will notice there are a few different types of restaurants. First up, they’ve got government-run places. These are a bit like school cafeterias… These state-owned places tend to be pricey and somewhat disappointing.PaladaresPaladares are privately owned restaurants, which are pretty much like what you’d find anywhere else in the world. They vary in price and quality so just research them like normal.While state-run spots tend to have the same high prices everywhere, paladares vary. In more touristy areas like Trinidad, you’ll pay more. If you get away from the hustle and bustle, you’ll pay rock bottom prices.Before you go, grab my guide to the best restaurants in Cuba!Casas ParticularesCasas particulares are a top pick. They are like bed and breakfasts so it’s a dream opportunity to experience a Cuban home while getting authentic home cooking. People with spare rooms open them up to tourists and it’s a win-win.I’d highly recommend staying in a casa particular if possible—it’s a once in a lifetime experience, AND the food is ultra-cheap. Just note that the meals aren’t usually included in the price. Breakfast will usually max out at $4-5 USD while dinner is usually under $12 USD.Kiosks and Street FoodLooking for an amazing meal for a dollar? Forget McDonald’s! It is all about street food and little hole in the wall places. You will find places offering up everything from fruit to chips to pizza to sandwiches to churros.And when I say hole in the wall places, I literally mean hole in the wall places. You will find tiny restaurants that serve food right through a little window on the street.Now that you’ve worked up an appetite, let’s count ‘em down! Here are the dishes you MUST eat in Cuba.PicadilloYou will find variations of this traditional dish all over Latin America and even in the Philippines. There are variations in each area. The Cuban recipe features ground beef, capers, green olives, and raisins. Sometimes it is eaten solo over rice, or you’ll find it as a filling for tacos and pastries.MadurosSo simple. So perfect. Sometimes called plátanos maduros, these sweet fried bananas are the quintessential Cuban dessert.Doesn’t that look tasty?Ropa ViejaIf you remember a bit of your high school Spanish, this name probably seems a bit weird. Known as “old clothes” in Spanish, this national dish of Cuba looks like a stack of colorful rags with its richly seasoned shredded beef and veg.TamalesThis one is a homegrown treasure. A Mesoamerican plate, tamales are typically stuffed with a corn dough mixture and meat then wrapped in a corn husk or banana leaf.Pro Tip: Removing the wrapper before eating!FlanThe Spanish brought this dish to the New World and it’s been a hit since day one. You might have tried this one before, but you’ll definitely want to try it again in Cuba!Why? While flan is often made with fresh milk, in Cuba, it is cooked with evaporated and condensed milk. Talk about a sweet treat!Cuban SandwichAlso known as Cubanos, these are admittedly a bit of a cheat but they are too good to ignore! First cooked up in Florida by Cuban immigrants, this sandwich is made from a type of traditional Cuban bread stuffed with ham or roasted pork and topped with Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard.Cuban Black Bean SoupThere’s nothing like good old comfort food! This rich vegetarian dish is seasoned with bay leaves, garlic, cumin, and paprika then topped with a dollop of sour cream.Yuca Con MojoYuca is a delicious veg taken from the root of the cassava plant. Cooked in a vibrant sauce made of garlic, lime, and olive oil, this is another one of Cuba’s best vegetarian dishes.Arroz Con PolloThe western cousin of paella, this rice dish has chicken and onion soaked in garlic and tomatoes. Arroz con pollo makes for great comfort food and isn’t too difficult to perfect!Lechon AsadoThis roasted suckling pig is a special celebration from that is made by burying the meat in the ground then covering it with banana leaves. Sometimes served with a few chopped herbs or a dash of lime, this is definitely a special treat!BonusYou’ll definitely have to try a mojito (or two!) while you’re there. Made of rum, mint leaves, soda water, fresh lime juice, and a little bit of sugar—it’s quite the refreshing drink! While you can find Cuban food all over the world, there is nothing like going straight to the source. Ready to start packing your bags? Here is how to spend 48 hours in Havana.

https://theblondeabroad.com/everything-u-s-travelers-need-to-know-before-visiting-cuba/,Everything U.S. Travelers Need to Know Before Visiting Cuba,Cuba,"Cuba has been in the news a lot over the past few years and there’s a lot of confusion about how Americans can visit Cuba. After my incredible 48 hours in Havana, Cuba’s magical capital, I have been getting a lot of questions about the logistics.While there is some new red tape, it is still very possible for Americans to visit this unique Caribbean island and it’s so worth it! It definitely takes some planning but Cuba is a one of kind place that deserves a spot on every traveler’s bucket list.Ready for a tropical escape you will never forget? Here is everything you need to know about how Americans can visit Cuba.UPDATE — June 6th, 2019   New Laws for Americans Traveling to CubaCuba – American relations are an ever-evolving situation. In fact, just this April 2019, new sanctions were put into place.The new regulations prevent “non-family travel” along with restricting the amount of money the people in the US can send to Cuba. The tightening of the restrictions is not-so-great news for cruise companies and some airlines, who have been offering direct daily trips to Cuba.The good news is that it is still very possible to get there.   HavanaUnderstanding the Travel CategoriesThere are 11 travel categories that allow Americans to visit Cuba. It is important to be aware that you will be choosing your own category.It is a bit like filing your own taxes where you choose what is right then just keep your documentation in case of a possible audit. Here are the categories of travel to Cuba authorized by OFAC:Family visitsOfficial business of the U.S. government or foreign governmentsJournalismProfessional research and business meetingsEducational activitiesReligious activitiesPublic performances, clinics, workshops, athletic and other competitions, and exhibitionsSupport for the Cuban peopleHumanitarian projectsActivities of private foundations or research or educational institutesExportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials   How to Travel Independently to CubaFor independent travel, “Support for the Cuban People” is typically the best option. In order to use this category, you’ll want to have “contact with the Cuban people, support civil society in Cuba, or promote the Cuban people’s independence from Cuban authorities that Result in meaningful interaction with individuals in Cuba” (read the fine print here).To travel as an independent traveler, here’s how you can adhere to the new policies:State that you’re traveling under any of the 11 categories, including the Support for the Cuban People category. You can declare that category when booking your flights, cruise, and accommodation, as well as during re-entry into the US.Make sure that your itinerary reflects your category or reason for traveling to Cuba. Stay at locally-run accommodation, “Casa Particulars” (and Airbnbs), eat at local restaurants, and support local businesses.Avoid staying at hotels banned by the US State Department and spending money at military-owned businesses (read more here).The whole process of choosing your purpose seems a bit complicated but just saying you are supporting the locals is pretty straightforward and it is the best way to experience life in Cuba! Americans can visit Cuba under this travel category by supporting local entrepreneurs.Go to locally run museums, independent markets, art shows, and generally just engage fully with the people of Cuba. Simply discussing the culture with locals is enough to qualify for this purpose.The essential thing to keep in mind is that you have to create a full-time itinerary showing that you’ll be doing the above.Read More: How to Spend 48 Hours in Havana How to Travel to Cuba in a Group TourThe “People to People Educational” category that allows you to travel around Cuba with a guided tour group. To claim this type of travel, you need to be with a US tour operator for the duration of your trip — as part of the new sanctions it’s required that the tour operator be a US company, that “focuses on educational activities that put the traveler in contact with the Cuban people, not the Cuban government”.Like the “Support for the Cuban People” group, you are required to have a full-time travel itinerary packed with cultural exchange and learning. Again, this isn’t really too hard to actually do.Eating Cuban food at local restaurants, chatting to people at the beach, going to galleries, and similar things are sufficient.If you’re arriving in Cuba on a cruise, you can still choose to explore independently or do shore excursions, but you need to follow the same general rules — avoid spending money at military-run businesses. Stick to local establishments and companies! You’ll also need to get your Cuban “tourist card”, which can be purchased through your cruise operator.Read More: Top 15 Things to Do in Havana     How to Get Your Cuban Tourist CardWhichever option you go for, you will need to get a Cuban “tourist card”. It’s crucial to note that this is not the same as a “tourist visa”, although both names might be used.Only people from the following countries need an actual “tourist visa” to go to Cuba: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, India, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka.Most other countries only need a tourist card. This card means that Americans can visit Cuba for up to 30 days (or up to 90 days for Canadians and a few other select nationalities).You’ll also need a valid passport and proof of travel insurance that covers medical emergencies and evacuation by air. I bought my insurance policy through World Nomads, and I’ve never had any issues claiming with them!If you fly from the USA to Cuba, you will need a more expensive tourist card (a pink card) that costs $99. If you can, have a layover outside of the US, and you can buy a green tourist card for $39 even if you have a U.S. passport.Cuba Visa Services is the official partner of American Airlines and Southwest Airlines. They are known for giving the best rates on the pink tourist card for Cuba and are generally a reputable company, so it’s a good place to get started.You can buy your Cuba Tourist Card online with Cuba Visa Services, or through your airline, before your flight or at the gate. OverallRemember to stay organized! I had an awesome time on my cruise to Cuba, but it was largely organized for me, so it was really straightforward and easy to keep records (but super limited on free-time!). Whether you go the tour route or travel independently, you have got to keep receipts.In fact, the US government requires that you keep them for up to five years to prove your expenses there! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-spend-48-hours-in-havana/,How to Spend 48 Hours in Havana,Cuba,"As one of the most intriguingly beautiful cities in the Caribbean, Havana has a special place in my heart! I had a whirlwind 2-day adventure in Cuba’s capital indulging every single one of my senses.With so much to see and do, I was able to maximize my time in Cuba with some advanced planning. While I’d definitely recommend staying longer if you can, it is possible to have a memorable trip in just a couple of days.Ready to get packing? Here’s how to spend 48 hours in Havana.Day OneGet Your BearingsI visited Havana with my best friend on an epic girl’s trip to the Florida Keys and Cuba. To make the most of our 48 hours in Havana, we started our trip with an hour-long tour in a classic car. Lounging in a bubblegum-pink vintage convertible was the perfect way to to tour the city.The driver took us around to all of the top sites, and I was able to get a sense of what was where. Before going, check out my tips for renting a car in Cuba. It’s easy and totally worth it.Strawberry Tours offers a Havana vintage car tour. It costs $29 for a seat or you can rent the whole vehicle out for $99.While it’s fun to do a tour by car, I found that a pedicab is the best way to get around. To see as much as possible in our short time, we hired a driver for the entire day.It’s an affordable option, and it let us comfortably take in the city while still getting around efficiently. The bicycle rickshaw drivers are locals who know where everything is and can give you an insider view of the city.Lunch at La GuaridaLa Guarida restaurant is a local icon, and it has a distinctly Cuban atmosphere. It’s the perfect place to get your first taste of the local cuisine, but it’s incredibly popular with tourists and locals alike so be sure to book in advance.Reserve a table on their website or give them a call on Skype.Read More: 10 Local Foods to Try in CubaGet Yo’ Drink On!When you’ve only got 48 hours, it’s okay to start your day with booze before breakfast — especially in Havana! After all, this is the birthplace of the mojito and daiquiri.Ernest Hemingway’s old haunts are famous around Havana. If you want to follow in his footsteps for an afternoon, get to La Bodeguita del Medio and La Floridita.La Bodeguita is the place to go for mojitos, while La Floridita is all about the daiquiris. Just keep in mind that both places are busy, so you’ll want to get there before they open.La Bodeguita opens their doors at 8 a.m., and you can get into La Floridita after 11 a.m.Historical SightseeingAs you likely already know, Cuba has a rich culture and intriguing history. Just in the short time that I was in Havana, I learned so much. Since you can’t get around to everything in two days, I’d recommend picking one or two spots for your first day and then see what you’ve got time for on day two.The Capitol Building, El Capitolio, is a grandiose building in the heart of Havana. You’ll surely end up passing by, and I’d recommend popping in to see the stunning architecture inside.The Museum of Revolution is another impressive building, which offers a world-class history lesson that will give you a deeper understanding of Cuban life and culture.Normally a cemetery wouldn’t top my to-do list, but the nineteenth century Cementario de Cristobal Colon is one of the most historically significant cemeteries in the world. If you’re a history buff, don’t miss this one.Last but certainly not least for fans of the famous American novelist, there’s Ernest Hemingway’s House. Known as Finca Vigía by the locals, it is just a quick bus or taxi ride from central Havana.Sunset Stroll on El MalecónThis five-mile coastal road has an energy like nowhere else in Havana. Take in the sunset here as you steal a glimpse into what life is like for Habaneros.Whatever you do, do not forget your camera when headed here! El Malecón is at its most beautiful just as the street lights start turning on.Dinner and a Show at La Parisienne at Hotel NacionalEnd your stroll down El Malecón at the Hotel Nacional. The old world charm here is undeniable, and I absolutely loved the show at La Parisienne.The Cabaret at La Parisienne at Hotel Nacional is an explosion of color! This non-stop show is an unforgettable dance through the history of Cuba.Day TwoSunrise Walk Old HavanaWhen you only have two days in such a culturally rich place, you have to get up early! But rather than rushing to see all of the top spots, I recommend simply wandering around aimlessly for awhile. Beat the tourists (and most locals) by getting out and about at sunrise.There are so many winding streets that will take you off the beaten path. Spend some time just taking in the beauty of Old Havana.Café MamainéOnce you’ve worked up an appetite, get over to Vedado, Havana’s central business district for a breakfast. The locals’ favorite morning beverage is a frozen coffee, so tack that onto your order, too.Café Mamainé is a cozy little restaurant that is perfect for sampling authentic Cuban food. The café also features locally produced art, making the eatery a cultural hotspot.Shop for Rum and CigarsWhether it’s for yourself or your loved ones back home, rum and cigars are a must-buy when in Cuba! When it comes to rum and cigars, Cubans make them best. So, even if you think you’re not a fan, I’d highly recommend learning a little bit more about the local specialties and giving them a try.Hit the BeachWhen it comes to beaches, Varadero is where tourists go, while Habaneros lounge at Guanabo. The easiest way to get to Guanabo is to grab a taxi from the park at the corner of Agramonte and Misión.From Guanabo, it’s less than two hours to Varadero. If you’ve got more time to spend in Cuba, it’s worth the trip, but if you’re limited to 48 hours on the island, you probably won’t get around to it.Historical SightseeingOnce you’ve gotten your fill of sun, get back to your cultural checklist. Again, in my opinion, the Capitol Building, Museum of Revolution, Cementario de Cristobal Colon and Ernest Hemingway’s House are must-sees. Whatever you didn’t get to on day one, try to check out on day two.Dinner at a PaladarPaladar is the local name for a privately-owned restaurant. Since most eateries are government-owned, eating at a paladar is one of the best ways to try homemade Cuban food in a family-run spot.My top picks for paladars are Paladar Los Mercaderes, which has a romantic feel and mouthwateringly good food; El Cocinero, a rooftop-terrace restaurant that serves up great food with a panoramic view; and Ríomar, a lovely waterfront place.Other than quaint cafés, most of the best places to eat in Havana require reservations, so do plan ahead, especially if you’ll only have time to check out a few places.Night out at Fabrica De Arte CubanoThis art-gallery-turned-nightclub is the hottest ticket in town. Open Thursday till Sunday, this is where the locals go!I’d recommend checking it out, but don’t make my mistake.We arrived there too late and ended up waiting for an hour in line without getting in. Try arriving early in the evening to make sure you’ve got plenty of time to check it out. "

For countless years, Americans weren’t allowed to travel into Cuba and the island remained lost in time. Far from the tourist havens of Mexico and Florida, Cuba became a place like no other. And then it finally opened up travel from the US (or rather, it’s somewhat open, the situation is complicated).Of course, I jumped at the first chance to see this magical island and it did not disappoint. My best friend and I spent a short 48 hours in Havana, so to make the most of our time, we decided to rent a pink convertible (of course!) and cruised through the colorful streets of Havana.It was a common sight to see vintage cars passing by the pastel houses that line every street in Cuba’s capital city. The 16th-century city center, Old Havana, is filled with beautiful Spanish architecture and there are photo ops around every corner.Just south of Miami and north of Cancun, the weather here is gorgeous pretty much year-round so it’s easy to just show up with a pair of flip flops and an open mind. There is an incredible amount of history to take in at museums all over the city that will open your eyes to the unique culture of Cuba. Don’t miss the Museum of Revolution, Cementario de Cristobal Colon, and Ernest Hemingway’s House!Like most Caribbean islands, of course, Havana is the perfect place to just chill out. There are picture perfect beaches to waste endlessly sunny afternoons.When it comes to beach hopping, my faves are the tourist haven, Varadero, and the local fave, Guanabo.Once you’ve gotten your fill of sun, it’s all about the nightlife. You never have to look far to find salsa music and, when you’re ready for a drink, it’s time for mojitos at La Bodeguita and daiquiri at El Floridita.Of course, you can’t leave without getting your hands on at least one Cuban sandwich and doing some souvenir shopping. Rum and cigars are the must-buy items here.Whether you’re a connoisseur or totally clueless, Cuba has the best rum and cigars on the planet so you’ve got to check them out, or at least grab them as gifts!READ NEXT: Tips for Renting a Classic Car in Havana"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-renting-a-classic-car-in-havana/,Tips for Renting a Classic Car in Havana,Cuba,"There is no better way to see Havana than from the backseat of a classic car. On my Cuban adventure, I rented a bubble gum-pink convertible for an unforgettable cruise around town and some once-in-a-lifetime photo ops!Ready to step back in time and soak in the incredible sights and sounds of this colorful Caribbean island?Here are a few essential tips for renting a classic car in Havana.Where to RentAll of the rental car companies are government owned. They are under different management, and you’ll find a few variations of the rules, but generally speaking, they are all the same.Everybody charges the same prices, and it’s a low-tech affair, so the easiest thing to do is to walk up to the car rental office.You’ll find a high concentration of car rentals near the cruise terminal, along the coast, and near the capitol building. Once you’re there, find a car that you like and make it yours.We paid $40 per hour for a gorgeous convertible.You can easily book a car once you arrive, but it can sometimes be hard to find a specific car (if you have a color and model in mind). We found the pink convertible after searching high and low, so it would have been nice to have it organized ahead of time.Strawberry Tours offers a Havana vintage car tour. It costs $29 for a seat or you can rent the whole vehicle out for $99 (for up to 5 people). While it doesn’t look like you can choose the color of your car (if you book an entire vehicle), I’m sure they would take requests! It also becomes cheaper at $99 for 2.5 hours than the $40 per hour I paid on arrival.Making a Plan for the DayIt’s best to rent a car for a few hours and get a driver. If you’re staying in Cuba for longer, I recommend getting around with taxis and buses.When it comes to traveling a long distance and navigating the winding side streets, they are the easier options. With that said, there is nothing like cruising down the main drags of Havana in your own classic car!To make the most of your time, follow a planned route. Any car rental agency will have a standard city tour map. It will take you through Old Havana, past all the main streets, and then back to your starting point.Taking a Ride with Gran CarThe first company to jump on the classic car bandwagon was Gran Car. For years, this state-run company was the only one offering tourists a ride around town in a vintage convertible.More recently, however, native Habanos have been offering people (not-so-legal) discount rides around town. While they can be cheaper than official Gran Car vehicles, you’ll ultimately be getting into a random unlicensed person’s car.Stay on the safe side, and look for cars that have a Gran Car sticker on them. They are the only legit cars in Cuba, and they are your best bet.The City TourWhen you arrive for your tour, you will see a map of all the stops. Here’s what to expect.Pickup locations:Hotel Nacional, The Ferry terminal, The Capitol building (outside)Stops — these are a few places you’ll definitely want to hop out of the car to explore:Hotel Nacional: Full of old-world charm, this place is a worth a visit whether you come for the night or just to take photos.Panoramic Tour Along the Seafront Avenue, Malecón: Officially known as the Avenida de Maceo, this iconic seaside promenade is one of the best places to get a sense of local life—day or night.The Revolution Square: Plaza de la Revolución is one of the biggest city squares in the world, and it’s the spot where you can take an elevator up to the top of the José Martí Memorial, one of the city’s highest points.Central Park: Stop here to sip a mojito while you watch the world pass by from the heart of Havana.Opera House: Gran Teatro de La Habana is one of the world’s most beautiful opera houses, and it’s a great experience even if you have only basic high school Spanish.Capitol Building: While it’s currently under construction, it’s still an impressive site.Former Bacardi Building: Bacardi left Cuba in 1960, but this art deco building is still a must-see.Prado Promenade: The dividing line between Centro Habana and Old Havana, this is one of the best strolls in the city.Sloppy Joe’s Bar: It was the place to be and be seen for American celebs in the 40s and 50s, and it just reopened to its former glory!Floridita Bar: Ernest Hemingway’s old haunt, the bar is famous for its amazing daiquiris.Museum of the Revolution: This is the perfect spot to learn about Cuba’s rich history, and it is housed inside the impressive former Presidential Palace.READ NEXT: 20 Trips to Take in Your 20’s"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-cuba/,Where to Find the Best Food in Cuba,Cuba,"In late December 2014 President Obama opened relations with Cuba, over 50 years after the embargo that stopped all US imports and meant that American citizens could not enter the country was first put in place. This shift has a lot of meaning, one of which directly affects the ability for Americans to travel into this previously forbidden city.In April 2015, via a partnership between Yoga For Bad People and Cuba Educational Travel, I headed there myself under one of the 12 now government approved categories.  Under a strict Cuban government approved itinerary, we had a detailed schedule that needed to be mostly followed each day. Though none of the people in our group were particularly used to traveling in this fashion, it was what was mandatory in order to be there as a US citizen, plus it did grant us undeniably incredible access to the fascinating country of Cuba.  During our week long stay, we had a huge amount of exposure to the cultural and historical elements that help make Cuba what it is today.  We were given a tour of the Museum of Cuban Art, guided by a Cuban art historian.  We were the fortunate audience to multiple live music performances in private venues, led by renowned Cuban singers and songwriters.  We were taken to the Nostalgic Cars garage, and spoken to about what it takes to repair classic cars by the owners themselves (and then given a surprise by being driven around in them!). We ventured three hours outside of the city of Havana to Pinar del Rio and were welcomed into the home of local farmer and tobacco connoisseur Benito for a lesson in cigars and coffee.  We visited La Finca Vigia, former home of Hemingway.  And of course we did yoga, though in this instance it did fall secondary to the intense days exploring Havana and beyond.  My adventures in Cuba did involve food as well, though the experience here was different than most.  Up until the early nineties paladares, privately owned restaurants, existed only illegally, and were somewhat limited in number.  Nowadays paladares are more plentiful, but the resources able to go into these are still limited as Cuba of course is a socialist country.  Meats are bought on the “black market” (which here only means bought outside of government regulation) and spices are brought in by relatives or friends of the owners who are fortunate enough to go abroad at all.  In my opinion, the venues themselves were more impressive in most cases than the food, which is not overly surprising given the circumstances.  The spaces were interesting though, and eclectic, artistic and impressive.  They were creative and colorful, and as full of life as the rest of Cuba was.  The most traditional dish you can find throughout the city is ropa vieja, which translated means “old clothes.”  Stewed beef and vegetables are the main ingredients.  Beyond this comes a lot of lobster (this was a bit hit or miss), fish, yuca, tamales and no shortage of rice and black beans.  The Spanish influence is prevalent in most dishes, as a direct result of the colonization of Cuba by this country years ago.  Mojitos tend to be the drink of choice!Here are my personal food highlights, and where to find the best food in Cuba! – El Cocinero –El Cocinero is the undertaking of rock, hip-hop, Afro-Cuban fusion musician X-Alfonso and is set up within an old cooking oil factory in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana.  There is a dining room on the ground floor and a large, outdoor patio on the roof with more tables for dining, a bar and impressive city views.  Next door is the Cuban Art Factory (La Fabrica de Arte Cubano) which had the most NYC like vibe out of anywhere we went.  Comprised of dozens of rooms, this space is a state supported project for blossoming young artists.  There are installations, paintings, poetry, dance and movie screenings at any given time.Read More: 10 Local Foods to Try in Cuba – Dona Eutimia –Located right in the center of Old Havana amidst the plazas and the modest art galleries that line the cobblestoned streets, Dona Eutimia is a recent addition paladar wise, but it’s history dates back to the 1970s when young artists used to gather near here to do their work.   Drop by for lunch and you’ll feel like you dipped into a local’s casual dining room! – La Guarida –La Guarida stood out to me the most out of all visited venues.  To get here you’ll go into what feels like an old, abandoned home, climbing dozens of large, marble stairs until it opens up to a bustling old Hollywood feeling restaurant on the very top floor.  Walking in it’s easy to feel like you’ve really come across something special.  The walls are adorned with photos of famous past visitors, like Jack Nicholson, Oliver Stone and Steven Spielberg.  Jazz music fills the air and light curtains wave as a light breeze passes.  The food is okay; not great, but overall La Guardia makes for a really good night out.   – Hotel Nacional –Brought to international fame by none other than Anthony Bourdain, Hotel Nacional is absolutely worth seeing.  Located nearby the equally famous Malecon strip, the combination of the hotel and it’s location is a real jolt into the Cuba many imagine.  Hotel Nacional has a breezy, tropical yet refined feel, with an air about it that gives off the notion that important things are happening.  Dine outside under the canopies and enjoy and appreciate the fact that you are doing what many have not.   – Finca Paraiso Agroecologico –Located between the Vinales region and the city of Havana, Finca Paraiso Agroecologica was the exact reprieve we were all looking for.  The restaurant is perched on the hill of a farm, where they churn out organic food and captivating views.  The dining room was essentially set up on their wraparound porch, overlooking the sprawling property!This was by far the biggest variety of food we encountered, with everything from tasty anti-stress green juice to grilled okra and carrots, dozens of salads, homemade soups and marinated meats and fish. – San Cristobal –If it’s good enough for Jay-Z and Beyonce, it’s good enough for me, right?  San Cristobal offers an incredibly interesting and eclectic interior, full of old books piled high on chairs, elephant statues scattered around, clocks, religious artifacts, palm trees and old photos lining the walls.  There is a huge central dining table in the middle of the restaurant, and smaller tables in offshoot rooms off of that.  After you dine make sure to grab a local cigar, too.  You’ll feel as if you’ve landed soundly in the mix of a majestic Cuban night out.READ NEXT: The Ultimate Foodie Getaway Guide to Aruba Read MoreWhere to Find the Best Food in Mexico CityThe Ultimate Guide to Puerto Rico in Three Days16 Adventurous Trips to Take in 201610 Budget-Friendly Travel Destinations Around the WorldShop these Havana-inspired style essentials!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){ var e, p; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js'; var cb = new Date().getTime(); p += '?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */"

Throughout Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and beyond, you will find the greatest Christmas markets in the world.Filled with twinkling lights and the heady aroma of holiday spices, these places are truly magical. And there’s no better way to experience the holiday season than on a river cruise.When I found out that Crystal Cruises does a Danube Christmas Markets cruise, I started packing. I have traveled through the Seychelles Islands as well as taken a Brazilian Holiday cruise (my first ever cruise) with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with cruises ever since.Cruising from Vienna, Austria, into Passau, Germany; Krems, Austria; and Bratislava, Slovakia, I saw some of the most breathtaking architecture I’ve ever seen in my life. And the markets! If you like to shop until you drop and explore foodie wonderlands, welcome to heaven.I fell head over heels in love with Austria on my European Christmas market tour. We started off at the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Vienna.With baroque architecture, this lavish former imperial residence would take your breath away at any time of year, and it is in its prime at Christmas.Next up, with chestnuts literally roasting on an open fire, Vienna’s most popular Christmas market, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz, delivers serious classic yuletide cheer at its 150+ stalls.In Austria, we also took a tour of the Salzburg Christmas Markets and the traditional markets of the Austrian Lake District. It was love at first sight with the little village of St. Gilgen. It was straight out of a storybook. With snow-capped mountains and icy lakes, the entire region is picture-perfect.Tagged the “most romantic market” in the region, the Christmas market in Passau, Germany, was my favorite. With its own unique flair, this place was everything I expected of a Christmas market and more.Of course, you can’t talk about Christmas without mentioning the food. So, for you foodies out there, head to the Bratislava Christmas Market. This Slovakia market delivers yummy dishes on an unprecedented scale.Ready to get in the holiday spirit? It’s time to start planning your own trip to visit the Christmas Markets in Europe."
https://theblondeabroad.com/danube-christmas-market-river-cruise-with-crystal-cruises/,Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises,Germany,"What better place is there in the world to spend Christmas than in Central Europe? Exploring the Christmas markets of Austria, Germany and Slovakia has always been a dream of mine, and it makes for an idyllic destination to enjoy a white Christmas.Ready to have your breath taken away by the snow-capped mountains and quaint destinations dotting the Danube River? Crystal River Cruises will get you there.My boyfriend, Meyer, and I spent ten days on the stunning Crystal Mozart and were blown away by the world-class hospitality and service. PLUS, cruising through the European Christmas Markets was a bucket list experience in itself.Here’s what to expect from the Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises.Day One: Vienna, AustriaWe were able to board the Crystal Mozart around noon on day one! Upon arrival, we got settled onto the ship, explored a bit, and then jumped on the complimentary shuttle into town to explore Vienna.We opted for an early night so we could get ready for our upcoming whirlwind adventure!Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Two: Vienna, AustriaWe spent the first morning out exploring the city. The Imperial Schönbrunn Palace and Christmas Market were the highlights of the day.The market outside the palace was one of my favorites! It was a picture-perfect introduction to Christmas markets and ended up being one of my favorite spots that we visited during the entire journey.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Three: Melk, AustriaOur morning started on a cruise through the Wachau Valley and we arrived late morning in Melk. This was such a charming region. As we went through the valley, I tuned my listening device in, provided by the cruise, to hear about all of the sights we were passing by.This region is famous for its Baroque architecture. We explored the Melk Abbey, and it was truly remarkable. The library was incredible, though, sadly, there was a strict “no photos” policy, but we did get some great shots from outside.Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Schönbühel Castle!Day Four: Salzburg, AustriaOur scheduled itinerary in Linz offered a full-day trip to Salzburg. We took the full-day trip around Salzburg’s Christmas Markets.We opted out of the tour of Hellbrunn Palace, but we heard it was beautiful and I would recommend checking it out. After returning to the ship, you’ll be docked within walking distance to the Linz Christmas Market.It’s right on the river, so it’s easy to get to and in its prime in the evening.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in SalzburgDay Five: Austria’s Lake DistrictThe next morning we took another full-day trip to explore the “traditional Christmas” scene of St. Gilgen and St. Wolfgang in Austria’s Lake District. This was one of my favorite adventures on the cruise.St. Gilgen is straight out of a storybook, and you get lots of time to explore the lovely St. Wolfgang. Both towns have incredible markets and great photo ops on the lake with views of snow-capped mountains in the background.Day Six: Passau, GermanyWe had such a hard time deciding what to do on this day! Our excursion options for this day were a Munich full-day tour, a Passau walking tour, a snow show hike, or both of the latter two. We decided not to do Munich — everyone said it was awesome, but it was a four-hour drive back from Munich to the ship.Ultimately, my boyfriend did the Passau Walking Tour & Christmas Market, while I stayed behind on the ship. It ended up pouring the entire day, and it made for a challenging day to be out and about.We had planned to do the Bavarian Snowshoe Hike when he got back, but assumed that we didn’t have enough warm clothes, so we ended up skipping it.This was yet another regret! We heard from other guests that it was absolutely fabulous.If you decide to skip Munich and do the snowshoeing, know that the company provides boots that go over your shoes, though packing snow boots are a great idea if you can squeeze them into your bag.Day Seven: Regensburg, GermanyThe day trip to Regensburg was definitely my favorite day. It is such a stunning town, and we got the whole day to explore on our own. We saw the main old town, then met back up with a guide to visit the “most romantic Christmas market”.Located at the doorstep of a German princess’s house, this market completely exceeded my expectations. We enjoyed lots of roasted chestnuts, gingerbread and mulled wine (famously known as glühwein in Germany).Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in Regensburg, GermanyDay Eight: Krems, AustriaKrem is known as the pearl of Wachau Valley and rightfully so. It’s rich in history and beautiful sights.We arrived on a Sunday, which means that pretty much everything in Central Europe is closed. Krems is a really sleepy town, and I’d suggest a solo tour rather than going for the Krems Highlights & Christmas Market excursion.Day Nine: Bratislava, SlovakiaAfter so many walking tours, it was nice to have a morning on board to just chill and soak in the five-star experience. We arrived to Bratislava at noon.We took the Panoramic Bratislava & Christmas Market tour and really loved the old town of Bratislava. It’s home to remarkable architecture.Not to mention, the Christmas market had TONS of food — much more than other markets we’d seen in Austria and Germany.Day Ten: Vienna, AustriaWe returned to Vienna and spent the whole day on our own walking to iconic spots like the Cafe Central and the most popular Christmas Market in Vienna, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz.Our cruise ended with a special Michelin dinner which was included in all 2017 bookings (double check your 2018 bookings to confirm yours)!Honestly, we already felt like we had been digging into Michelin quality meals the entire time, but it was a great experience to gather all the other guests together at one massive table to chat and share travel stories.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Eleven: DepartureWe packed up all of our Christmas gifts and market souvenirs, and disembarked the Crystal Mozart late morning.Crystal River Cruises had another complimentary shuttle back to the airport, so we could haul our souvenirs without any hassle. An absolute life-saver when traveling!Instead of heading straight home, we decided to extend our trip and head over to explore the city of Budapest! Staying at the incredible The Ritz-Carlton, Budapest, this city quickly became one of my all-time favorite European destinations.All photos edited with TBA Presets!Thanks to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my stay. As always, thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-the-christmas-markets-in-regensburg-germany/,"Visiting the Christmas Markets in Regensburg, Germany",Germany,"Admired for its stunning medieval city center, the small city of Regensburg is one of Bavaria’s must-visit destinations. Located in southeastern Germany on the Danube River, I fell in love with this storybook town on an exploration of the greatest Christmas markets in Europe.Nicknamed Italy’s northernmost city, this UNESCO World Heritage spot has a rich history and is chock full of architecture that is just begging to be Instagrammed.Ready to explore one of German’s greatest treasures? Read on for a detailed look at my experience exploring the Christmas markets in Regensburg, Germany.About RegensburgRegensburg is located about 80 miles from Munich (two hours by bus) and 140 miles from Salzburg (three hours by train).A town of about 140,000 people, the closest airports are in Munich and Nuremberg, which is just about an hour away by train. It’s a bit off-the-beaten-path for most tourists but well worth a visit.Regensburg has over two millennia of history, and that’s just one of the many reasons why history-buff travelers adore this town.For me, visiting Bavaria was all about authentically experiencing German culture more so than I have in other German tourist hotspots like Berlin and Frankfurt.What to See and Do in RegensburgOld Town: Of course, your first stop in Regensburg must be Old Town. As Germany’s best-preserved medieval town, strolling through the heart of the village is like stepping back in time.Old Town boasts Roman remnants and a vast array of buildings from the 11th to the 15th centuries.I highly recommend wandering around without a plan. Just be sure to bring your camera and wear a good pair of walking shoes! Then see where the city takes you as you explore the winding alleyways and discover countless quaint nooks.Danube Valley Boat Trips: I explored Germany on a Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises and adored it.Even if you don’t do a full cruise, I’d definitely recommend a boat trip through the Danube Valley. You’ll have an idyllic view of the city, and they range from one-day trips to ten-day journeys.Tip – It’s cold in Germany in the winter, and Bavaria is no exception, so come bundled up! Famous for its white Christmas, Bavaria’s temperatures usually range from 30 to 40 degrees, but it’s not unusual to see the thermostat dip even lower.You definitely want to spend some time outdoors exploring, so be sure to pack plenty of warm layers.Christmas Markets in RegensburgRegensburger Christkindlmarkt: Popular since back in the 18th century, this place is still a local favorite. In fact, Germany voted this iconic market their country’s top Christmas market.As soon as you walk in, you float through the incredible aroma of roasted chestnuts, gingerbread and mulled wine (famously known as glühwein in Germany). Centered around the famous church, Neupfarrkirche, this world-famous Christmas market runs from the end of November until Christmas Eve.Romantic Christmas Market: The picture-perfect courtyard outside of Thurn und Taxis Castle hosts a magical market. Situated right on the doorsteps of the royals, the courtyard is lit with lanterns and candles.The Romantic Christmas Market in Regensburg has different evening themes, and they vary from year to year, so check out the calendar when you’re there. And, if you’re up late, stop in after 9 p.m.The crowds clear out from 9 until closing time at 11 p.m., so you’ll have space to explore, and you’ll benefit from discounted entry.When you’re there, look for something called “Feuerzangenbowle”. This love potion is an upgraded version of mulled wine with a sugar cube and rum lit on fire.Lucrezia Markt: Located at Haidplatz and Kohlenmarkt right beside the Romantic Christmas Market of Regensburg, Lucrezia Markt should have a spot on your Christmas market tour. It’s the perfect place to find one-of-a-kind handicrafts that make perfect gifts."
https://theblondeabroad.com/river-cruise-onboard-crystal-cruises-mozart/,River Cruise Onboard Crystal Cruises’ Mozart,Germany,"There is no better way to take in Central Europe’s greatest sights than from a river cruise. Winding through picturesque Austrian cities of Vienna, Melk, Linz and Krems onto Passau, Germany and into Bratislava, Slovakia, the Festive Christmas Market Cruise on the Danube River was a dream with Crystal River Cruises. The cruise takes you through the best of the best on the Danube.I took my first ever cruise with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with them ever since. They wowed me on a 15-day Brazilian cruise over Christmas and New Year’s Eve, and I hopped on the Crystal Cruises’ Esprit Yacht for an amazing adventure around the Seychelles Islands.Ready to get your sea legs? Here’s an inside look at my experience onboard Crystal Cruises’ Mozart.The ShipWe set sail on the 154-passenger Crystal Mozart riverboat. The ship was a floating resort with everything that you need for a luxe escape.The Crystal Mozart has a state-of-the-art fitness center (with an outdoor stretch, yoga and Pilates space) a spa, café, ice cream bar, swimming pool, and everything else your heart would want from a top-of-the-line hotel.Everything on the ship is all-inclusive, which promises a truly stress-free experience. It started with complimentary airport transfers from the airport to the river yacht.The ship also has nice perks like twice-daily room cleaning and free clothes pressing. There’s a 24-hour self-service pantry where you can grab a midnight snack and drinks, or you can just go for the 24-hour room service.And, the service really is incredible. I chatted with so many guests onboard who mentioned that they’d been on three or more cruises other than Crystal River Cruises, and they all said that they kept coming back because of the incredible hospitalityThe RoomWe stayed in the Penthouse with the French balcony, and it was très chic. The room boasts a king-sized bed (which can be converted into two twin beds), a vanity, good-sized closet, 40” HDTV, Nespresso coffee machine, and a two-seat sofa.The Crystal Mozart has a few different options to choose from. There is a suite with a fixed window, penthouse with a French balcony, 1-bedroom Crystal penthouse with a French balcony, and two-bedroom Crystal suites (connecting rooms) with a French balcony.They’re all gorgeous digs, so it comes down to your group size and budget.The FoodOn arrival, we had all our meals and drinks included — and I’m talking about five-star indulgences, including premium beverages like champagne. For breakfast, it was a lavish buffet or a la carte.The Festive Christmas Market Cruise onboard Crystal Mozart is all about Michelin-starred culinary experiences. The food is farm-to-table and features an array of fresh, locally sourced ingredients from the port city. It is the perfect chance to check out the best of the best in the world of Central European cuisine.There are multiple dining venues around the ship including the main restaurant, outdoor seating, a European style Bistro, Waterside Market, the Pantry, the Palm Court and the Piano Bar.My favorite part? The all-you-can-eat gelato bar!Activities and EntertainmentFrom the minute we boarded the Crystal Mozart we were surrounded by Christmas. It got us in the holiday spirit and had an array of activities to represent each country on the itinerary.There was everything from local dancers to guest speakers to get us in the festive mood.Of course, sometimes there was just nothing better than just sitting back and looking out to admire the scenic Wachau Valley and Danube River.Overall, compared to sailing by yacht or with Crystal at Sea, this tour had the most activities and time off the ship. I had so many unforgettable experiences exploring the cities and towns of Austria, Germany, and Slovakia.For me, Central Europe is a dream Christmas destination. From the Christmas markets filled with mulled wine to the roasted chestnuts, the entire region is a winter wonderland and Crystal River Cruises made it easy to see it all.[/tbabox]More InformationCruise Ship: Crystal MozartLocation: Danube River, Northern EuropeCost: $$$-$$$$Thanks to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-oktoberfest-in-munich/,The Ultimate Guide to Oktoberfest in Munich,Germany,"This post was written by Sivan, one of our Travel Expert Contributors!Oktoberfest is a huge festival in Munich, Germany that happens annually from mid-September to the beginning of October. The festival takes place over three consecutive weekends during which more than seven million people from around the world attend.Historically, the festival is a celebration of the marriage ceremony between Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese in 1810. Today, Oktoberfest, which takes up 420,000 square feet in Munich, is known for rides, attractions, games, and of course, beer.Navigating this large festival can get confusing so here is my ultimate guide to Oktoberfest in Munich!Where to Stay for OktoberfestThere are a few ways to go about finding accommodations for Oktoberfest, but the number one thing I would advise is to BOOK EARLY. A typical rule of thumb for any big festival is that the closer it gets to the event, the more expensive things are going to be. Here are some of my top Oktoberfest recommendations:Wombat’s City Hostel: This hostel is a short walk to the festival, and it has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Remember to book as far in advance as you can because accommodations this close (and at this price) will go fast!Jaeger’s Hostel Munich: This is another excellent hostel option. It is close to the festival and has clean rooms with private bathrooms and everything else you need for an easy stay.Platzl Hotel Munich: If you’re looking for something on the fancier side, this is going to be your best option. Of course, with nicer accommodations comes at a higher price point.H’Otello Munich: This modern, urban hotel is near the city center and the Oktoberfest grounds. It is a great place to lay your head after a long day of festivities.Book an Airbnb: Airbnb is a great option if you’re looking for a more personal space to come home to at night, and there are tons of Airbnb’s near the festival. (A lot of them can get even closer than any hotel can.)You can find a range of places from a solo room, if you’re hitting the festival alone, to an entire apartment if you want to go with a big group of friends.Camping: If you are looking for a little more adventure, a few campsites rent out tents specifically for Oktoberfest. These tend to be a bit farther away (think twenty to thirty minutes by public transport, seven to ten minutes by taxi or Uber), but they can make for a fun weekend.Check out Stoke Travel if you want a highly social campsite where the party will be going until five in the morning. Use booking code ‘BLONDEABROAD’ for some extra freebies too!You can also try the official Oktoberfest Campsite in Munich for something a little closer. These campsites offer a range of options from two-person tents with air mattresses to glamping teepees with more luxe options. Be aware that September in Germany can get very cold especially at night; pack accordingly if you are going to be sleeping outside.Getting Around MunichMunich has an efficient metro system that’s pretty easy to understand (even with all the German names). Depending on where you choose to stay, you might have to take a bus, to a train, and then walk a little to get to your final destination.Uber is currently operating in Munich, so there is always that option or the traditional taxi. Once you get close to the festival, arrows painted on the sidewalks will point you in the right direction (plus, you can follow the crowds of people dressed in Dirndls and Lederhosen).Helpful  TipGoogle Maps always has a transit option for anywhere you are looking to go, which will tell you exactly which lines or buses you need to take to get there.What to Expect at Oktoberfest in MunichThe festival opens early, but tents start serving beers at around ten a.m. and stop serving at 10:30 p.m. If you don’t have a reservation and want to get a table, prepare to arrive between six and seven a.m.You don’t need to buy tickets to get into the festival, but there is a lot to buy once you get there.The Oktoberfest grounds are enormous, and you can choose from tons of tents and activities. Start by taking a walk through the main street to get your bearings (and scan the food options).There are more than fourteen big tents and twenty smaller tents at the festival. It can be hard to decide which ones to visit, but most of them are generally the same.Here is a breakdown of a few of the big ones:Winzerer Fahndl has a fun, authentic atmosphere that makes people want to stay all day.Hofbräu Festhalle is considered the “American tent.” You will find a lot of college students and other international travelers here.Schottenhamel is the tent that starts it all! The first keg is tapped here at noon on the first day of the festival.Löwenbräu-Festhalle is a favorite for locals and travelers alike (in other words, Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans). This is a good middle ground tent.Fischer Vroni serves grilled fish and other dishes. If you are not feeling the typical meat and potatoes from the other tents, head here.Schützen-Festzelt has a good mix of young and old, travelers and locals.Augustiner-Festhalle is known as the friendly tent.Weinzelt is the wine tent! If you are ready for something other than beer, head here for your pick of white, red, and sparkling wines.Pschorr-Bräurosl is one of the more traditional tents and has been managed by the Heide family for seven generations. This tent is filled with mostly locals.Be aware: If you stand on the very top of a table that means you are going to down your entire beer. So unless you want hundreds of people cheering you on to chug your stein, don’t stand on the top of a table.(source)What to Drink at OktoberfestThe main drink of Oktoberfest is of course…beer.To get a stein of beer in a tent, you must be sitting or standing at a table. Sometimes this can be tough as the tables are all very crowded. If you’re traveling solo or with a small group, people will usually let you stand near their table so that you can order.Once you’ve secured a spot, it’s up to you to catch one of the beer maids (they’re easy to find) and order a stein. One stein of beer typically costs ten to twelve euros, and it is easier for everyone if you have exact change ready.The maids are typically handling five to ten beers at a time, and things can get messy!If you’re not a beer lover, but you still want to partake in the fun, try a “Radler” or “shand,” which is beer mixed with lemonade! Also, beware that a stein of water is around eight euro. Your best bet is to get a bottle from an outside booth.There are also a couple of booths on the outside labeled “café” that sell coffee, sodas, wine, and various hard liquors. Be aware that the beer in Germany is about six percent alcohol—American beer is usually only three to five percent.(source)What to Eat at OktoberfestA ton of food stands line the main street, but most of them are repeats, so if you see something that catches your eye, grab it when you see it!Some things you’ll find are bratwurst, pretzels, french fries, candy-coated assorted nuts, chocolate-covered fruit, gingerbread cookies (can double as a souvenir), and fish.For all you vegetarians, some booths even serve veggie burgers!If you do get lucky enough to sit at a table inside a tent, order some food! All the tents serve traditional steaming-hot German meals that smell, look, and taste delicious. Most of it is some variation of pork and potatoes.If you’re not at a table and you’re feeling a little peckish, there are always people walking around selling giant pretzels.Helpful  TipGrab a pretzel midday to soak up some of the alcohol.(source)What to Wear to OktoberfestA majority of the people at Oktoberfest wear the traditional clothing, which is a dirndl for women and lederhosen for men. It is totally fine not to wear these, but you will stand out. You can order dirndls and lederhosen on Amazon before you arrive in Germany, but be aware that they aren’t traditional, and they might end up looking more like a Halloween costume.The best option is to buy your garb at a store in town. Dirndls and lederhosen are available all over near the festival, so they won’t be difficult to find. Dirndls range from seventy to 150 euros while lederhosen range from ninety to 200 euros.Some of the campsites or hostels may even sell them for discounted prices.Make sure you TRY THEM ON before you buy! Ladies, the top of your dirndl is going to be tight, but make sure you can still breathe and that there is a little room for when your belly gets a little fuller later in the day.As far as shoes, people wear all different things. The most traditional footwear for females is a pair of ballet flats, kitten heels, or booties. But, a lot of people also wear converse or another kind of sneakers. I recommend buying a cheap pair of shoes you won’t care about getting dirty because you will most likely be walking through puddles of beer by the end of the day.Though it is cold during late September and early October in Germany, don’t worry about wearing a jacket or sweater. It gets very hot inside the beer tents, and you will more than likely lose a jacket if you take it off.Some ladies wear nude or black tights under their dirndls, but the majority of women wear them without anything extra and are still comfortable. Remember, dirndls are long, and they have a lot of fabric and layers.Lastly, if you can help it, don’t bring a purse. There are way too many stories of people who have things stolen (cell phones, credit cards, and even passports) during the festival. The best thing to do is go old school; take only what you need and stuff it somewhere on you!Helpful  TipWear a pair of shorts with pockets underneath your dirndl. With all the fabric in the skirt, nobody will be able to see them, and then you will have somewhere to safely store your belongings! "

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-travel-germany-on-a-budget/,How to Travel Germany on a Budget,Germany,"Europe is well-known as a budget travel region for its ease of transportation and countless destinations that won’t break the bank.Although the Euro has weakened against other currencies recently, traveling in Germany can still be fairly expensive when compared to other European destinations.As with all travel, if you are cautious in your spending and make the best of your options in terms of getting value for your money, it is still very possible to travel Germany on a budget and enjoy the experience!Naturally, there will be some compromises on dining options and sightseeing to get the most out of your trip, but you don’t have to lessen the experience to make it affordable.Here are my best tips on how to travel Germany on a budget!Budget  Transportation in GermanyThe off-season in Germany runs from November – March, so flying into Germany will be cheaper during these months. You may want to consider flying from the US into a major hub like London, and then taking one of the many European discount air carriers (such as Ryanair or Flybe) or a train to Germany.Frankfurt and Berlin are also typically less expensive to fly into from the US than other German cities. Check out my beginner’s guide to budget airfare in Europe!Although Germany has an excellent high-speed train network, the tickets aren’t always the most affordable, so if you do want to take the quickest way to your destination, make sure you book your ticket a few weeks in advance.If time isn’t an issue for your itinerary, you will often find that regional trains or busses will be much more affordable.Helpful  Tip: In cities like Munich, you can purchase daily or weekly city cards for public transportation which end up to be cheaper than paying for a bunch of individual bus and metro fares.Budget Accommodation in GermanyIf you are really looking to travel on a shoestring in Germany, then your best bet is to find cheap accommodations on your route. Hostel dorm rooms are available for 10-20 EUR per night and if you want a private room, you can spend up to 60 EUR per night at either a hostel or budget hotel.If you’re like me, take advantage of night travel and catch some free “zzz’s” in the airport or train station!In bigger cities in Germany (or during peak season), be aware that dorm beds here can cost up to 30 EUR per night. As a budget alternative, you can find typically find cheaper accommodation farther from city center and travel in daily by bus or metro.Read Next: How to Find Cheap Accommodation Around the WorldEating and DrinkingBerlin is by far one of the cheapest destinations for food and drink in Germany. For those who are trying to save as much money as possible, meals from the street vendors can offer the best budget meal for under 5 EUR.The traditional German specialties like Bratwurst, Kartoffelsalat (potato salad) or Currywurst, a hot pork sausage cut into slices and seasoned with curry sauce, are delicious ways to experience local culture and only cost around 3-5 EUR.Another meal option you might not expect is the wide range of ethnic food that Germany has to offer. It actually tends to be cheaper than traditional German food, so treat yourself to falafel, kebabs or a Lahmacun (Turkish pizza).After a night out, you’ll often find that local “late night” food is a Turkish döner kebab. They’ll only set you back a few euro and are delicious!Beer is obviously very popular in Germany, but it will typically be more expensive if you are drinking in a bar or beer cellar. Grab some bottles to store at your hostel or find smaller local brewers to save a few euros here and there.Helpful  Tip: If you are going to be drinking beer, look for the local beer varieties that are cheaper than the national beer brands.Budget Activities in GermanyActivities and attractions are usually the biggest spending category for travelers outside of accommodation. In Germany, guided tours or riverboat cruises will set you back around 25 EUR or more, so balance your expenses with some of these budget activities:Walking tours are a great way to get your bearings when you arrive in a new city, and give you an idea of the main sights you want to go back to. Most hostels in big cities offer walking tours daily that are usually free with a recommended tip for your guide at the end.Plan your trip to fall during a local wine festival or the traditional Christmas markets.Check out which museums in a city interest you, and check to see if they have a certain day of the week or time period where they offer free admission.Renting a bike can typically cost around 15 EUR a day but allows you to see more of the city or outdoors area than you could walking!If you are going to be exploring the outdoor region, like the Black Forest or Berchtesgaden National Park, consider hiking by yourself instead of as a guided group.Spend an afternoon having a picnic in one of Germany’s beautiful parks, like the Englischer Garten in Munich. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-copenhagen/,Where to Find the Best Food in Copenhagen,Denmark,"I had been to Copenhagen once before in 2008, on what was actually my very first venture in solo travel.  I remember feeling completely liberated, but also undoubtedly a bit scared, nervous and not completely sure of what I was getting myself into.  My second stint in Copenhagen was one that I initially did intend on going at alone.  What I find often happens these days though, is exactly what happened in this particular instance.  I was having brunch with my cousin, I told her that in two weeks I was jetting off to CPH over the pending Memorial Day weekend, and she looked at me and said “I’ll come.”  I wasn’t sure if I believed her, but like the true jetsetter she is, she very quickly turned it around and made it happen.  The food scene in Copenhagen is exceptional, and the creator of many a destination on the international food map.  Noma was born here after all, and from that has spun off hits like Amass, Ralae and Bror. It certainly doesn’t stop there though.  Here are some of my favorite places to find the best food in Copenhagen!Atelier September There are a couple of places around the world that I often find myself thinking of and wishing I could eat at regularly.  Atelier September is more of a cafe than a restaurant, but it’s still one of them.  It’s housed in a beautiful old antique store that feels French and flirty.  The avocado toast is gorgeous, and the yogurt with granola and fresh berries is a must, too.Amass Something about the space and feel of Amass makes you smile before you even take one bite.  And then you do take a bite, and your smile grows even larger. Amass is in a huge old warehouse on a large plot of land along the water, sprinkled with graffiti and dripping in energy.  Said to represent spontaneity, the tasting menu changes on a daily basis to ensure supreme freshness and seasonality.    Ved Stranden 10Ved Stranden is a gorgeous wine bar right alongside the canal.  It’s the perfect place for a mid-day stop when you’re in need of a few drinks or a bite to eat amidst the Danish wandering.  Manfreds & VinManfreds & Vin was a surprise hit.  Stocked with lowkey undertones, we went in thinking this was going to be one of more casual culinary excursions.  Casual in atmosphere it was, but it was everything but that when it came to the caliber of food.  This ended up being a standout destination, with dishes prepared simply but with a distinct air of sophistication and flavor.  I loved it.  Go, and you will, too.    Meyers Bageri and Coffee CollectiveMy favorite street in all of Copenhagen is called Jaegersborggade in the impossibly cool area of Norrebro.  There are a dozen uber-chic locales here ranging from bars to bakeries to boutiques, all of which are excellent.  Don’t miss a pastry from Meyers Bageri and a coffee from Coffee Collective!Bodega Around the corner from must-see Assistens Cemetery in Norrebro, Bodega is a funky cafe that is home to brunch for the locals.  Find pancakes, sausage and bacon here, and also the more traditional Danish breakfast of cured fish, breads and boiled eggs.  TorvehallerneThe 60+ stands that comprise this open-air food market range from the famous Grod porridge outpost to Summerbird Chocolate to the recently opened Hija de Sanchez, baby of Noma’s ex-pastry chef Rosio Sanchez.  Get yourself here quickly, then stay for a while.  What are your favorite restaurants in Copenhagen?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-santa-cruz-island-in-the-galapagos/,The Ultimate Guide to Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"Home to the largest town in the Galápagos—Puerto Ayora—Santa Cruz Island is one of the most popular islands to visit while traveling to the Galápagos.Here you’ll find giant tortoises, beautiful hikes, beaches as far as the eye can see, the Charles Darwin Research Center, pit craters, and World War II remnants; it’s an island that truly has it all.Because Ecuador uses the dollar, getting around the island is super simple. Plus there are lots of ATMs about so you’ll never have to worry about not having cash on hand for activities. And trust me, there are plenty of activities!Here is my guide to visiting Santa Cruz Island in the Galápagos!Getting to Santa Cruz IslandOne of the easiest and cheapest options is to take a ferry from another island—like San Cristobal.You’ll want to keep in mind that these ferries are not like traditional ferries. They’re small boats that fit up to 20-30 people with very limited space. They can be very cramped and they’re not ideal for those who get motion sickness as the seas can get quite rocky…however, they are a great way to save money.If you’d rather skip the rough waters, you can fly into Seymour Airport on the island of Baltra.You’ll fly into the airport, take a bus ($5 USD) to a ferry ($1 USD for the public boats or $2 for private) and that’ll take you right across the channel to Santa Cruz Island. From there you’ll be able to find plenty of taxis and buses. A private taxi is $25 into the Puerto Ayora and can fit up to 4 people!One thing to remember when taking a taxi is that the ride takes anywhere from 35-40 minutes so if you’re flying out of Baltra, you will want to give yourself at least 2 hours to get from Puerto Ayora to the airport.Things run on Galápagos time on the islands!  Santa Cruz IslandWhere to Stay on Santa Cruz IslandAves Charles is the main strip with shops, restaurants, and the port. Any hotel you find near that area is a great option! These are some fantastic options if the idea of finding the perfect spot in Santa Cruz overwhelms you.Hotel IkalaThis is the hotel that I stayed in during my most recent trip and I absolutely loved it. Located in the center of it all, everything is super nearby and walkable. Plus it has great mid-range rooms and the property has free bicycles that you can use to get around!Finch BayIf you’re looking for a higher-end, eco-friendly option, Finch Bay is right up your alley. Named one of the most unique lodges in the world by National Geographic, this hotel is not located in the main town so you will have to take a water taxi everywhere. Luckily the water taxi is included in your stay.Hotel SolymarThis Mediterranean-style 4-star hotel is located right on Pelican Bay, in the heart of Puerto Ayora. The rooms feature private balconies with ocean views. Relax after a day of hiking at the outdoor pool that overlooks the sea.Galápagos DreamsThe Galápagos Dreams is a great budget-friendly hotel that is located right in the center of it all, making everything walkable. The staff are extremely helpful and are more than willing to help you arrange excursions and tickets.Hotel Galápagos Suites B&BIf visiting the Darwin Research Center is high on your Galápagos bucket list, staying at this 3-star spot is perfect for you. It’s super close to the visitor center and rooms start as low as $65 a night!Hostal Galápagos Morning GloryIf you’re looking for a hostel setting, Hostal Galápagos Morning Glory is your best option. Just a short 15-minute walk will bring you to restaurants, shops, and beaches. Plus you have access to free Wi-Fi and a lounge area complete with hammocks and a TV.What to Do on Santa Cruz IslandScuba DivingWhat would a trip to the Galápagos be without a scuba diving adventure? Santa Cruz is one of the best spots to scuba dive. I highly recommend going with Scuba Iguana Dive Shop! You’ll have the chance to see hammerhead sharks, sea lions, turtles, large schools of fish, and so much more.Visit the Charles Darwin Research StationFounded in 1959, the Charles Darwin Research Station is dedicated to the preservation and conservation of the Galápagos Islands. This includes watching over all of the plants and animals that call the islands home. At the Research Station, you can see the last remaining Pinta Island giant tortoise, land iguanas, and more.Visit Tortuga BayTortuga Bay gets its name from the black sea turtles that come onto the shore and lay their eggs. Along with the turtles, you can also see white-tip sharks, iguanas, and flamingos.   Day Trip to Bartolome IslandBartolome Island is a volcanic island just off the coast of Santiago Island and it makes for a great day trip. Once there you can snorkel, swim, and hike to some of the best views of the Galápagos. There are many companies that offer these day-trips so it’s hard to recommend just one!Snorkeling Day TripAlong with the day trip to Bartolome, many companies also offer snorkeling trips to nearby locations such as Los Tuneles, Isabela Island, and Pinzon Island (just to name a few!).  Visit Reserva El ChatoEl Chato is a reserve located in Santa Cruz’s highlands and is home to giant tortoises. The tortoises cross the reserve during their migration, making it one of the only places to see these giant animals in their natural habitat. Along with the tortoises, the reserve is also home to thousands of forests and plants.ShopThere are so many little shops along Ave Charles Darwin Road, perfect to pick up some souvenirs from your trip!Visit Las Bachas Beach with a GuideLocated at the northern end of Santa Cruz, Las Bachas got its name from the Americans after WWII when their barges washed up onshore.Locals could not pronounce “barge” correctly, therefore, resulting in “Las Bachas.” Here you can see flamingos, crabs, sea turtles, and remnants of WWII.  Where to Eat on Santa Cruz IslandKeep in mind that prices in the Galápagos are not comparable to other “South American” destinations. The Galápagos are expensive and the food/beverage prices are the same that you would probably pay back home!1835 Coffee Lab1835 Coffee Lab is by far my favorite spot to grab a coffee or tea on the island. Not only is it a great cup of joe, but they also focus on sustainability and the promotion and distribution of coffee culture in the Galápagos Islands and Ecuador.De Sal y DulceCan you tell I like coffee shops? De Sal y Dulce is a great spot for coffee and dessert. They’ve got delicious cappuccinos and brownies if you need a little afternoon pick me up.ANKERANKER offers local Galápagos cuisine, using flavors based on seasonal produce from the island. You can experience a 5-course meal or à-la-carte options paired with cheap cocktails. If you like seafood, you’ll love their dishes.La GarrapataTo get the authentic Galápagos Islands experience, dine at La Garrapata, a local favorite. It was one of the first open-sided and relaxed restaurants on the island and offers a myriad of seafood dishes.Bahia MarLocated right on the ocean, Bahia Mar specializes in Ecuadorian cuisine while also including other international dishes as well. There’s nothing better than sitting right on the water while enjoying some lobster.Finch Bay RestaurantIf you want a fine dining experience during your visit, Finch Bay Restaurant is a great option. They offer breakfast, lunch, dinner, cocktails, and also have a wine cellar with a wide variety of vino.Isla GrillIf you’d rather enjoy a casual meal with a bunch of food options, Isla Grill is the spot for you. They have everything from sushi to steak to vegetarian options, all reasonably priced. It’s also a cool spot to grab a drink.Santa Cruz BreweryCraft beer drinkers will love Santa Cruz Brewery. Not only is the beer delicious but they also have light bites, live music, and games that you can play. It’s not something you’d expect to find in the Galápagos but it makes for a fun evening!Ukku Açaí BarUkku serves beautiful açaí bowls in large wooden pineapple-shaped bowls, complete with fresh fruit. They’re the perfect light snack while you’re out wandering around and shopping.Have you ever been to Santa Cruz Island?

It was the best way to wind down!   San Cristobal   San CristobalSan Cristobal is where it all began.Upon arrival at the Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, we were treated to a delicious buffet lunch before exploring El Junco, a caldera of an extinct volcano and the only sizable lake in the Galápagos.From there we hopped aboard our home for the next week, a luxury yacht, where we sipped on cocktails and enjoyed a multi-course meal while we got to know our fellow passengers.Cerro BrujoTranslating to “Wizard Hill,” Cerro Brujo was the perfect place to spot wildlife via zodiac (small boats). From brown pelicans to brown noddy terns to blue-footed boobies, it was one of the best ways to start the trip out.We also saw unusual geological formations, one being The Cathedral—aka Darwin’s Pants.And what better way to end the day than with a trip to the coral sand beach? Swimming, kayaking, paddleboarding, snorkeling, you name it!With the help of our GoPro cameras, we got some incredible underwater shots of the marine life of Cerro Brujo!  Espanola IslandWhat would a trip to the Galápagos be without seeing some marine iguanas sunbathing on the dark rocks?Well in Punta Suarez on Española Island we saw just that as we explored! We also found Darwin’s finches, hood mockingbirds, Galápagos doves, red-billed tropicbirds, Galápagos hawks, and more.After lunch on the boat, we got to be a part of a cooking demonstration on how to make authentic Ecuadorian ceviche!Talk about delicious!     Floreana IslandPunta Cormorant on Floreana Island is known for its olive-sand beaches, sea lions, and lava herons.The green mineral that you see in the sand is caused by a high concentration of iron and manganese from the same basaltic lava found in Hawaii.After following a trail to the beach, we found the spot where turtles lay their eggs and rays were swimming in the shallow waters. During our snorkel trip at Devil’s Crown and Champion Islet, a shallow sunken crater, we saw a brilliant array of colorful fish and coral, sea turtles, sea stars, and white-tipped sharks!Being able to capture these moments with our GoPros was truly magical.After a long day in the water, we participated in a Galápagos tradition at Post Office Bay—where visitors are invited to leave a postcard and pick up any letters destined for their home to then deliver once they’re back. How fun is that?  Santa Cruz Island    Getting that GoPro shot! Santa Cruz IslandOur stop in Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island was quite different than the other stops. From quiet islands to a harbor full of boats, bustling with activity. With a population of 24,000, Puerto Ayora is a great place to explore and pick up some souvenirs.One of the highlights of Santa Cruz is getting to visit the Giant Tortoises in the highlands. The climate in the highlands could not be more unique to the coastal warmth of the harbor. We entered through misty conditions to a densely forested landscape. It felt like we were walking through a jungle…Santa Cruz really has it all—from the lava tunnels at El Mirador to Los Gemelos (a pair of massive craters) to an artisan chocolate shop that sells delicious truffles. Choosing what to do in this port was the hardest part of our trip!  Bartolome Island; Captured on GoPro HERO8    Our Wonderful Guide, Ceci Bartolome IslandAfter a day of hustle and bustle, we were once again in solitude. And it was time to get to work. With about 400 wooden steps winding around the island, we worked for the beautiful view at the top.The gorgeous panoramic view of Pinnacle Rock was well worth the effort.    Captured on GoPro HERO8 South Plaza + Seymour IslandStarting our morning off in South Plaza, a small islet with tall cliffs and a trail with plants and wildlife, we saw an abundance of birds and the island’s “Opuntia,” a prickly pear cactus that can only be found on South Plaza.During lunch, we sailed to Seymour Island where we saw frigate birds with red sacs on their inflated chests. It was the height of the mating season!To end the day, we joined the captain and crew for a champagne toast to celebrate a wonderful week. It was extremely bittersweet saying goodbye to new friends and the crew that made this TBA Escapes trip unforgettable. TBA Escapes Galápagos “Luxury Yacht Eco Expedition” Testimonials“The TBA Escapes Tour to the Galápagos was an experience I will never forget. The Galápagos never really crossed my mind as a typical travel destination for me. The Blonde Abroad inspired me to visit this pristine location and I could not be more thankful that I was able to travel here with TBA Escapes. If I had not traveled to the Galápagos with TBA Escapes, I don’t think that I would have the same appreciation for my time there. Being with a group of women who also have the same appreciation for travel and new experiences made it that much more special. Kiki and Lauren’s attention to detail when planning and organizing this trip was much appreciated. I can honestly say that I will be telling all my female friends to take a trip with TBA Escapes if they ever get the opportunity to. I can’t wait to see what new destinations are added to TBA Escapes in the future and I am already itching to go on another adventure!”-Christina M. “The Galápagos Islands are a once in a lifetime experience. This was a personal bucket list item I can cross. The TBA escapes tour was very well executed from start to finish. Our naturalist guides Natasha and Cici are two highly trained and knowledgeable on all things Galápagos. Tba did an amazing job selecting the boat, guides, and accommodations for this trip. Having the opportunity to travel with a diverse group of women was empowering and enriching. The trip provided a safe haven to explore new ground and cultivate new memories. I’m looking forward to my future trips within TBA escapes.”-Katelyn P. “TBA Escapes took me on an incredible adventure to Ecuador and the Galápagos! This was my first experience with any sort of tour based trip and it definitely set the bar pretty high! The communication leading up to and during the tour was exceptional. Every detail was thought out and even though we had a group of 18 girls, I felt like I had individual attention when it came to coordinating my flights and hotel arrangements, as I arrived and stayed longer in Ecuador. The group of women, including Kiersten and her teammate Lauren, were inspiring and positive adventurous travel companions, who made the experience that much better! I will definitely be booking another trip with TBA Escapes in the future!”-Lyndsy H. One final shot on the GoPro HERO8!

With pristine beauty and incredible natural wonders, these islands are well worth the trip.Located 600 miles off the west coast of South America, the islands are a part of Ecuador that make up the Galápagos National Park and the Galápagos Marine Reserve.Ready to start packing? Here’s the best time to go to the Galápagos Islands.December to February in the GalápagosThe Galápagos Islands can be a perfect break from cold weather. The temperatures start rising during the winter, but it doesn’t get oppressively hot.You’ll be looking at nights down to 70 degrees (F) and afternoons around 80 degrees (F). It is the perfect weather for lounging at the beach mid-day, but it’s also not too hot to go out hiking and exploring.By the end of February, temperatures start getting closer to 90 degrees mid-day so that might slow you down a bit. Anytime from December to February though, you’ll find warm waters that are perfect for diving in!Christmas through the middle of January is peak tourist season as everybody comes down looking for a warm exotic spot to spend the holidays, so expect some crowds.This is one of the best times to visit the Galápagos Islands because the Galápagos Giant Tortoise eggs start hatching. You might be able to stumble across this in the wild, or you can get over to the Charles Darwin Research Centre on Santa Cruz Island or the Puerto Baquerizo Moreno Tortoise Breeding Centre on San Cristobal Island to guarantee a look at these incredible little guys.Read More: Giant Tortoises and Lava Tubes on Santa Cruz IslandMarch to April in the GalápagosThis is the hottest time of year. The temperatures range from 80 to 90 degrees (F), and this can feel extra sultry on humid days. I’d recommend opting for a hotel with A/C to keep cool overnight.Except for the week around Easter, you won’t find many tourists here during this time, so you’ll have the place to yourself.As far as snorkeling and diving, the visibility is pretty low so it’s not ideal conditions. The water is hot though so the swimming is still prime.Tip- Whatever time of year you go, check out my Galápagos Islands packing guide to make sure you’ve got all of the essentials!May to July in the GalápagosSummer is a great time to go to The Galápagos Islands. The temperatures typically hover in the 70s, so it’s comfortable, but the waters are still warm.You might have a few rainy afternoons, but it won’t put a major damper on your trip. You’ll see more tourists during the summer and for a good reason.In May, the adorable blue-footed boobies will be mating. There are very few blue-footed boobies outside of the Galápagos Islands, so this is a truly rare sight.Fun fact- In local Spanish, boobie means “silly” or “foolish” and these birds got their name for their hilarious way of walking and the fact that they’ll fearlessly come right up to people.Summer is also the best time to see humpback whales and sharks. Humpback whales begin their migration in June, and you’ll have the chance to dive with whale sharks anytime during summer.Another one of my faves is seeing the Galápagos sea lions! They tend to breed in July, so they’re usually active during this time.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideAugust to November in the GalápagosThis is the time of year that I visited the islands. I had an amazing experiencing sailing the Galápagos with Ecoventura.August to November is the coldest time of the year, and it tends to be misty and rainy, so it’s not a great time for lounging at the beach— although the red beaches of the Galápagos are worth a visit in any weather!Tourists tend to disappear after August so you’ll find reasonable prices and plenty of space to spread out. Best of all, the colder and clear water from August to November create dream conditions for snorkeling and diving.And keep your eyes peel for the sea lion pups! After breeding season in July, you’ll see a lot of little ones pitter-pattering around in September.Read More: Cruising the Galápagos with EcoventuraWATCH all of my Galápagos videos!"

The beauty of the Galápagos Islands is that they are miles away from the rest of the world, and full of the most serene landscapes and insane marine and wildlife. I spent eight days on Ecoventura’s luxury MV Origin cruising through the Galapagos and exploring the islands.I planned out a range of outfits while figuring out what to pack for the Galápagos Islands, and ended up wishing I had brought some other essential items (specifically- water shoes!).If you’re headed to the Galápagos Islands, you’ll most likely be spending long days hiking, boating or in the water, so it’s important to be comfortable first and foremost– I opted for bikinis, breathable fabrics, and sturdy shoes!Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on the weather and season of your own trip to the Galápagos Islands!My Galápagos Trip DetailsLocation: The Galápagos! Rábida Island, Fernandina Island, Genovesa Island, Tagus CoveTravel Dates: NovemberSeason: Dry Season. I don’t know why, but I imagined the Galápagos Islands to be tropical and full of vegetation. During the dry season, the islands are barren, and the water is cold.Weather: The weather in the Galápagos during November is relatively cool and dry. I was wearing a t-shirt and shorts most days and found it to be sunny with a few overcast days. However, you’ll want to be prepared because we did have one day of slight showers! Be sure to check out my post on the best time to travel to the Galapagos for complete details!Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideLuggage Requirements and Baggage Allowance in the GalápagosTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance for your flights to the Galápagos. If you’re traveling on your own or with a tour company, odds are you’ll be taking a speedboat or water taxi between islands, and you won’t want to lug heavy bags around, so I recommend packing as light as possible.Plus, if you’re doing a Galápagos cruise, the cabins can be very small, and you don’t want to take up your precious space with tons of luggage!

I also HIGHLY recommend bringing comfortable water shoes — you’ll be walking on beaches and rocks, so they’re a lifesaver. Hiking in the Galápagos is not typically hard, but you’ll be walking on uneven and rocky places, so plan accordingly.6.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-black-turtle-cove-in-the-galapagos/,Visiting Black Turtle Cove in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"After exploring Rábida Island on the sixth day of my Galápagos cruise, we took a trip over to the mangroves at Black Turtle Cove.Located on the north shore of Santa Cruz Island, Black Turtle Cove is a perfect spot to check out sharks; we spotted black tip and white tip sharks on the way over. It’s also a dream destination for getting some peace and quiet.Exploring Black Turtle CoveThis is a place like no other. Part of the Galápagos National Park, Black Turtle Cove is a quiet sanctuary for local wildlife. Boats have to turn off their motors here, so you’ll rarely hear more than the sounds of nature around you.From the panga, we navigated into the cove and the mangrove forest. It is peaceful and full of animals, like turtles, sharks, and rays. And the mangroves! The trees themselves are beautiful.Black Turtle Cove is a lush area and the perfect chance to get into the local animals’ secret hideaways.We saw herons and pelicans all over the trees, and there are rumors that Galápagos sharks lurk in the waters of the mangroves.Exploring on a silent panga made the whole experience feel completely serene. Navigating through the mangroves in slow-mo was perfect for snapping shots of the animals in their natural habitat.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideWATCH all of my Galápagos videos!"

It’s also home to the Galápagos Islands’ largest city, Puerto Ayora, which hosts about 12,000 people. While tiny, Puerto Ayora is a hub for travelers. It’s got one of the few airports in the Galápagos, and there are tons of tour companies based there.We wandered through lava tubes, and then got to see giant Galápagos tortoises!Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideLava TubesOf course, you can’t leave the Galápagos Islands without exploring some of the underbelly. I got the chance to wander through the underground lava tunnels, and it was incredible.Getting underground is the perfect way to wrap your head around the lava-layering process that created the Galápagos Islands. Expect to get down and dirty. There’s plenty of turtle poo around, and you might need to do a bit of shimmying to get through the tight spots.Helpful  TipYou’ll want to wear long pants and a rain jacket along with proper socks and shoes. In fact, bring rain boots if you have the luggage space.The Last AfternoonAfter checking out the lava tubes, we came back to enjoy some more time on the boat and our last day on the sun deck.After unwinding for a bit, we headed back to explore Puerto Ayora. While it’s a small town, it’s a good place for a stroll. This is the place to buy your souvenirs. From cheesy T-shirts to local handicraft, the city has got a pretty decent supply of stuff.Reserva el ChatoSouth of Santa Rosa, you’ll find El Chato Tortoise Reserve (or El Reserva el Chato). This place is part of the Galápagos Islands National Park, and you’ll want to have a guide.The giant Galápagos tortoise are one of the most well-known endangered species in the Galápagos, and perhaps the globe. This tortoise population was once as low as 15 tortoises, located on the Island of Espanola, but the population has recovered to multiple islands now, including Santa Cruz, Floreana, Isabela, and San Cristobal.At El Reserva el Chato, you can observe the giant tortoises doing their own thing in the wild. You’ll also get to see Darwin’s finches, yellow warblers, Galápagos rails, and other local birds in the reserve.WATCH all of my Galápagos videos! "

As a beach lover, I’m always ready to explore new and interesting coastal spots. I’d heard about the red beaches of the Galápagos, so they’d been at the top of my checklist for a while.This ended up being one of my favorite stops along the cruise!Read More: What to Expect on a Luxury Galápagos CruiseHiking Around the IslandWe visited Rábida Island with the conservationist guides from onboard the MV Origin. They took us on an educational hike around the island, leading us to lagoons filled with pink flamingos and up hills to incredible viewpoints.We passed lines of Galapagos Cactus and Palo Santo trees, spotted brown pelicans nesting, marine iguanas lounging on the warm rocks, mocking birds and yellow warblers as we made our way along the trail.On one side of the island, you can hike up a hill for an amazing view of the red-sand beach below!The conservationists shared information on the Blue-footed and Nazca Boobies, which can be found nesting along the coastline, as well as the rarest species of birds that can be seen in the Galapagos, such as the Galapagos Hawk and nine different species of Darwin Finches.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideThe Red BeachesSure, we all love white-sand beaches, but there’s something magical about colored beaches. The vibrant red sand of Rábida Island (red, from high iron content) and its rough volcanic coastline are absolutely stunning. While this isn’t the kind of beach for lounging around for hours, it makes up for it by being ultra-photogenic.Rábida Island has beautiful turquoise water, and the red coastline is dotted with cacti.You will also find tons of sea lions hanging out on this beach. If you’re lucky, you may have a curious little sea lion come and say hello while you hang out! (As with every destination in the Galápagos, keep at least 6 feet away from wildlife.)Helpful Tip: The beach isn’t smooth here, so I don’t recommend going barefoot. You will want to bring your water shoes or at least some good sandals to walk around.Exploring the WaterThe water around Rábida Island wasn’t as cold as the water in other places in the Galápagos, so I got to snorkel in a shorty wetsuit without freezing, which is always a good thing.I saw some big fish and a few sea lions swim alongside me. There are supposed to be a lot of sharks in the area too, but I didn’t get the chance to see one.After checking out the undersea world, I was ready to see things from slightly above sea level again. We were able to hop on a kayak directly from the beach then get out to see Rábida Island from the surface.WATCH all of my Galápagos videos! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-tagus-cove-in-the-galapagos/,Visiting Tagus Cove in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"After spending the morning exploring Fernandina Island with Ecoventura, we sailed to Isabela Island to check out Tagus Cove.This gorgeous cove is protected by two volcanic craters, and it’s a top spot to check out local wildlife. Isabela Island is the biggest island of the Galápagos. Spread over 1,790 square miles, it’s actually way bigger than any of the other islands, and it’s a definite must-see.Sailing to Tagus CoveI had a great time getting to Tagus Cove. We had lunch on the MV Origin’s sun deck. There were grilled tuna, homemade sangria, and fresh salads. Ecoventura had a kayak trip planned for us, but I was loving the sun deck too much, so I decided to lie out on the deck for a while and started reading Voyage of the Beagle.I’d definitely recommend one of Charles Darwin’s books for the adventure.The Galápagos Islands inspired some of his greatest ideas. Reading Darwin’s books really brings the islands’ history to life. He talks about Tagus Cove and tons of other spots in the Voyage of the Beagle, and it’s cool to experience it while you’re reading.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel Guide Exploring Tagus CoveLocated across from Fernandina Island, Tagus Cove is full of life! On the cruise, you can kayak, paddle board and snorkel. I chose not to kayak, but a lot of the guests said this was the best spot for it because they saw a ton of wildlife along the rocks.The sea floor around the cove is covered in green algae, which attracts tons of iguanas, fish, sea lions and other sea life, so I was lucky enough to spot chocolate chip sea stars, turtles, and sharks while snorkeling.The currents were strong, but it was still a fun experience.Historically, the cove was a safe anchorage bay for over 300 years, coupling as a pirate hideaway, so you can see the names of the countless ships that passed through here carved into the cliff. We learned that a lot of the graffiti is from US Navy ships in the mid-1900’s, but you can still see names of more historical vessels!After snorkeling, we went for a panga boat ride. It was a chance to see more penguins, birds, and the graffiti up close.Helpful Tip: There’s also a blowhole that’s great for pics if you get the timing just right!Read More: Visiting Fernandina Island in the Galápagos Winding DownOnce we explored Tagus Cove, we went back to the MV Origin to unwind. The yacht has a great Jacuzzi, and it’s the perfect spot to relax after a long day of sightseeing.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-fernandina-island-in-the-galapagos/,Visiting Fernandina Island in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"I was lucky to visit many pristine destinations in the Galápagos while on a weeklong cruise with Ecoventura, onboard the MV Origin yacht.On the fifth day of my Galápagos cruise, I finally got to see Fernandina Island.Fernandina Island is one of the most remote places in the Galápagos Islands and lies just over 500 miles from mainland Ecuador. Since my cruise was eight days long, Fernandina Island landed right in the middle of my trip. I had seen lots of wildlife up to now, but I was seriously blown away by the landscape and volcanic rock formations of this island especially.We had a great day out here—and it was the first day we got sun before noon! The sun started shinning at ten a.m. and it was the perfect temperature for exploring.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel Guide Fernandina IslandThe largest pristine island in the world, this is also the youngest island in the Galápagos. And when I say the youngest, I mean around one million years old. On top of being the youngest…this island is also the most active volcanically!The islands of Fernandina and Isabela have the largest iguanas you will find anywhere in the Galápagos. And the beach! The coastlines are gorgeous, and there are amazing cracks all over the lava. You’ll definitely want to have your camera handy. Punta EspinosaThis is probably my fave spot in the Galápagos. The beach is a long stretch of lava and sand on Fernandina. We went for a short walk along the peninsula then followed along the edge of the lava rock for a long journey around.Punta Espinosa is like walking around inside of a Nat Geo special.The area is full of mangroves, tons of lava rock, and gorgeous lava cactus bunches. There are penguins, seals (lots of babies!), and blue-footed boobies everywhere you look.After spending an incredible morning exploring Fernandina Island, we headed back to the MV Origin for lunch.There was a ceviche snack waiting for us, which was SUPER yummy! The Galápagos has its own unique style of ceviche, so it’s definitely something you will want to add to your must-have experiences on the islands.After the ceviche, we set sail for Isabela Island to check out Tagus Cove.Read More: Visiting Tagus Cove in the GalápagosWATCH all of my Galápagos videos! "

It’s home to Dragon Hill and is also one of the best places in the Galápagos Islands to see land iguanas. Not to be confused with the marine iguana, the Galápagos land iguana is yellow/brown in color and is only found on, you guessed it, land.We only spotted 3 along our hike, but more can be seen during different times of the year.You might see them taking siestas on trails, lounging on the rocky beaches, or feeding on cactus. It’s a cool chance to see them in their natural environment!SightseeingThere’s so much to take in around Dragon Hill. You can easily spend a full afternoon exploring the island, and that’s exactly what we did. Wandering along the lava flow on the beach and checking out the countless land and marine iguanas is a pretty great way to spend a day.While the island of Venecia is inaccessible, you’ll be able to see it from Dragon Hill.This untouched island is part of the Charles Darwin Foundation and the Galápagos National Park conservation program, and even from a distance you’ll see marine iguanas basking on its shores. Prickly Pear CactusAnother one of the fun parts of hiking around Dragon Hill is checking out all of the different cacti. There are six species of prickly pear cacti around the Galápagos Islands.Land iguanas eat them, but you can sample them too. Prickly pear cacti have three edible bits known as cactus fruit. They are the pads (nopal), the petals of the flower, and the pear (tuna).From super hot to sweet, they all taste really different from each other.You can find them served solo (raw or cooked) as well as in a wide range of salads, candies, jams, juices, and pretty much anything else you can think of.WATCH all of my Galápagos videos! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-las-bachas-beach-in-the-galapagos/,Visiting Las Bachas in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"After visiting Genovesa Island on the first day of my Galápagos cruise, we began day 2 at Las Bachas beach.Las Bachas is the perfect spot for a morning walk along the shore– if you’re lucky, you’ll find flamingos in the lagoons and Sally Lightfoot crabs scampering all over the rocky tide.Located on the northern coast of Santa Cruz Island, this quiet little beach is the perfect spot to unwind. It got its name during World War II when the American army abandoned its barges. Two of those barges found their way to the shore of the Galápagos. The locals couldn’t quite wrap their heads around the word “barge” and called them “bacha” instead.Ever since then, the beach has been famous for those two old bachas.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel Guide Wildlife at Las Bachas BeachThis pristine white-sand beach is known for its incredible wildlife. Home to flamingos, Sally Lightfoot crabs, and countless birds, this is a nature lover’s paradise. It is also one of the top sea turtle nesting sites on Santa Cruz Island.The waves are gentle here, so you can go snorkeling. You might spot some turtles or fish along the rocky spots, but it’s not the best place to see them. The area is really sandy so the water can be cloudy. Packing TipsLike many places around the Galápagos Islands, this place is all about nature, so you won’t find any facilities on this beach. Bring sunscreen, water, and anything else you might want.It’s also a good idea to wear water shoes if you want to go exploring because there are a few spots with sharp rock.Read More: What to Pack for the Galápagos Islands Next Destination: Dragon HillAfter checking out the beach, we headed back to the boat for lunch. After taking a break on the sundeck while the boat was refueled, we sailed away to our next destination (and one of my fave spots in the Galápagos), Dragon Hill!Read More: Visiting Cerro Dragón (Dragon Hill) in the GalápagosWATCH all of my Galápagos videos! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-genovesa-island-in-the-galapagos/,Visiting Genovesa Island in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"I started my first full day in the Galápagos, onboard MV Origin, by visiting Genovesa Island!Also known as Bird Island, this spot is known for its gorgeous ecosystem. The island is shaped like a horse-shoe and was formed from the eruption of a volcano. This resulted in a submerged crater and is what we now know as Darwin Bay, which is surrounded by steep cliffs.We took a dingy to the island and arrived at Prince Philip’s Steps. As soon as the boat stopped, I was surprised at how arid and hot the islands are; definitely not the climate I was expecting!Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuidePrince Philip’s StepsThis is the first place I’ve encountered wildlife that is so fearless around people. The “locals” at Prince Philip’s Steps came right up to check us out.Prince Philip’s Steps leads up the cliff-face to a plateau where you’ll walk along a trail with an incredible amount of birds. We got the chance to learn about the breeding and nesting habits of nazca boobies, red-footed boobies, frigates, and other local wildlife.We even saw an owl! This spot is apparently one of the best places to see the famous red-footed booby, so keep your eyes peeled. Afternoon Snorkeling at Darwin Bay BeachWe had lunch on the ship then headed over to Darwin Bay beach. Darwin Bay is the area of water surrounded by Genovesa Island.There is great snorkeling at Darwin Bay beach. The waters are filled with starfish, rays, and white tip reef sharks. The one snag in my underwater adventure was drowning my camera. Sadly, it took some serious damage because the housing wasn’t sealed properly while I was snorkeling.If you’re bringing an underwater case for your camera, learn from my mistake and be sure that each time you enter the water it is properly sealed.Helpful Tip: Be sure to plan on some extra time to lounge around. If you hang out on the beach for a while you are bound to make friends with some of the sea lions who love to chill there.Packing TipsThere isn’t a ton of great shopping in the Galápagos, so I recommend bringing everything you will need. Bring your beach essentials, like a swimsuit, sunscreen, dry bag, sunglasses, and a hat.You will find the essentials on the main islands, but expect to pay a premium on sunscreen. I think it was close to $20 a bottle!While Ecoventura does provide wetsuits, I brought my own.You’ll also want to pack a rain jacket, water shoes, and binoculars for exploring. Of course, last but not least, a zoom lens and a GoPro waterproof camera are must-haves! The GoPro is a great camera to bring to the Galápagos because the animals are curious and will come right up to the lens!Read More: What to Pack for the Galápagos Islands "

You HAVE to visit the Galápagos!In addition to cruising the islands, I stayed a few days on San Cristobal Island at the Golden Bay Hotel, so I could explore more of the local culture and get some great dives in.

For those less eager to jump in the water, there are daily tours by dingy either to land or via sea to discover the wildlife of the Galápagos. Adventure FilledEcoventura had a perfect mix of activities and downtime. We had activities throughout the day, so I always felt like we were maximizing our time in the islands.We also had plenty time in the afternoon to just lie back and relax on the cruise, which was really nice!Most of our mornings began around 7 am with dingy rides to the islands with our guides. We encountered all sorts of wildlife on nature hikes and typically had the option each day to enjoy different water activities. Different Itineraries Each WeekEcoventura is always changing things up.

You can expect to see marine turtles, giant tortoises, boobies, frigates, and more. 600 miles away from the mainland, the plants and animals of the Galápagos are truly unique.You’ll witness endemic, indigenous and endangered species making this destination unlike anywhere else in the world.I was most astounded by the curiosity of the wildlife here. I’ve never witnessed animals so unafraid and interested in humans. While we always kept our distance from all animals, we often had frigates, penguins and sea lions approach us to get a better look. Expert GuidesEvery MV Origin Ecoventura luxury Galápagos cruise has two level-three conservationists.

https://theblondeabroad.com/cruising-the-galapagos-with-ecoventura/,Cruising the Galápagos with Ecoventura,Ecuador,"With a five-million-year history, The Galápagos Islands are an absolutely incredible destination. These UNESCO World Heritage Site islands have an amazing story and ecosystem.The best way to take it all in is with a tour. The Galápagos isn’t really a place for solo exploration, so it is really important to find a top-rate tour company that has professionals to show you around.With two decades of experience, the people at Ecoventura tour company know their stuff. I spent eight days on their newest luxury ship, the MV Origin, and had an unforgettable adventure.Here’s my experience cruising the Galápagos onboard Ecoventura’s MV Origin!The ItineraryThere are a few different options for traveling around the Galápagos Islands with Ecoventura. You can choose a travel time from seven to fourteen days. There’s a southern/central route (route A) and a western/northern route (route B).I opted for the western/northern route, but both routes have got some fascinating sights, so you really can’t go wrong. You will be able to snorkel with penguins, see Galápagos Tortoises, kayak alongside sea lions, and see the volcanic formations.Each region of the islands is dynamic, so it’s a tough choice!Beyond dates and directions, you can also opt for a private yacht charter, ladies-only ship, a family-friendly excursion, or even a wedding ceremony.

To maximize your time exploring the islands, go with a true professional. Ecoventura offers the only cruise in the Galápagos with two conservationist guides on each ship.All of the conservationists are licensed and speak fluent English.Ecoventura works with the World Wildlife Fund, Rainforest Alliance, and countless other ecological groups to help preserve the precious ecosystem of the Galápagos Islands. There was such an emphasis on sustainability and environmental responsibility onboard, and that made the trip even better for me!Other GuestsThe Galápagos Islands attracts a wide range of people from all over the planet. One of the highlights of my trip was getting to know the fellow travelers. The people on the Ecoventura cruise were all ages.The group activities brought us all together on the cruise, and there were ample opportunities to chat and connect with other travelers.

There was plenty of time to unwind, but I was never bored, which is pretty rare on tours. It’s hard to find that sweet spot where you have just enough to do, but Ecoventura managed it.Most days started around seven a.m.—a perfect time to get going if you want to make the most of every day out.Of course, the days are filled with guided nature walks that open your eyes to the remarkable ecosystem of the Galápagos. To get into the nooks and crannies of the islands, we traveled by pangas, or dinghies. These inflatable boats took us through the mangroves, estuaries, coves, and caves.When you’re ready for some solo exploration, you can go out for snorkeling, kayaking, and paddleboarding. One of the best parts of each day was having wine at sunset with the crew.Life is so incredibly different in the Galápagos, and it was great to have the opportunity to hear stories about real life in such an exotic and isolated spot.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-on-getting-to-the-galapagos/,Tips on Getting to the Galápagos,Ecuador,"The beauty of the Galápagos Islands is that they are miles away from the rest of the world. Far from the noise and chaos of city life, this is the perfect place to get away.The problem with getting to the Galápagos Islands is that they are in the middle of nowhere. 600 miles off of the coast of Ecuador, these islands are truly remote. Fortunately, it isn’t that hard to get there and it’s well worth it.Here are some helpful tips on getting to the Galápagos and island hopping! Flying to the GalápagosThere are two airports in the Galápagos– you can fly into San Cristóbal Island or Baltra Island. Baltra is located just north of Santa Cruz. Baltra and Santa Cruz are accessible by ferries, so it’s easy to get back and forth.You’ll often hear the Baltra airport being referred to as the Santa Cruz airport, so keep that in mind if you see the two island names being used interchangeably.Since you won’t find international flights to the islands, you’ll typically connect through Quito or Guayaquil. Both of these cities that are worth exploring, so plan on a little extra time to see the sights before you head away from the mainland.I flew from LAX to Guayaquil to San Cristobal on Avianca Airlines.As soon as you’ve got your dates set, you’ll want to book your flights. The fights from Guayaquil to San Cristobal are nonstop and just under two hours long. They book up really quickly with tourists and islanders traveling to and from mainland.Summer is high season in the Galápagos, and it’s also a popular route from mid-December to mid-January. If you’re traveling during these times, be sure to have everything booked far in advance.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to The Galápagos Islands Cruising the Galápagos IslandsThe Galápagos are made up of thirteen large islands and seven small islands. To get between the islands, you either travel by air or sea. I recommend taking a cruise around the islands to see everything.I went on a cruise onboard the new MV Origin and loved it. The company, Ecoventura, has received awards from Travel+Leisure, Conde Nast Traveler, and other top travel pros. You can totally customize your experience, and the company’s guides are incredibly knowledgeable.With so much to take in, the Galápagos is a place where I knew I wanted to have an expert showing me around. The pros and conservationists abroad MV Origin completely exceeded my expectations.I learned so much about the unique ecosystem of the islands and what makes this place so special.Not only do the staff members at Ecoventura know the local environment, they respect it. As a leader in the world of sustainable travel, this company helps people see the amazing natural wonders of the Galápagos without leaving a footprint.Read More: What to Expect on a Luxury Galápagos Cruise Traveling from Island to IslandTraveling without a tour is totally doable too, as there are speedboats, ferries and water taxis available, depending on where you are!There are a few different companies offering speedboat trips. One of the most common routes is between Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz, and Puerto Villamil, Isabela Island. The boat leaves daily from Isabela at six a.m. and from Puerto Ayora at two p.m.It’ll take you under three hours to get from one port to the other.If you are traveling between San Cristobal and Puerto Ayora, you can take the daily ferry from San Cristobal at seven a.m. and from Puerto Ayora at two p.m. Again, it’ll take you under three hours, but the waters can be a bit rough here, so I’d recommend bringing some motion sickness pills if you’re prone to getting woozy.There are also water taxis in some spots. They are a popular way to get from one end of Santa Cruz to the other. They are very cheap and just take a few minutes.You’ll want to remember that water taxis are just small boats that take you to the local sites.When you want to get to another island, you’ll need a ferry or a speedboat. These work on a set schedule and can’t be hailed like a water taxi. Traveling on the IslandsThe system of taxis is pretty straightforward, and you really can’t get lost. You can flag down taxis easily. Keep your eyes open for white pickup trucks with taxi signs.They are incredibly cheap and very handy if you are traveling with luggage.I stayed a few days following my cruise on San Cristóbal in Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, and found that I could walk anywhere in town within 10 minutes, so all I needed to worry about was booking a taxi to the airport– which only cost me about $2.Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideThanks to Avianca for hosting me on the flight out of LA.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-golden-bay-hotel-spa-in-the-galapagos/,Staying at Golden Bay Hotel & Spa in the Galápagos,Ecuador,"With some of the best beaches in the world and fascinating wildlife, the Galápagos Islands have always been a dream destination for me. They are one of the very few places left that are still pristine and untouched by major development. Sitting alone in the Pacific Ocean, this archipelago is 600 miles from the coast of Ecuador and a world away from anywhere I’ve ever seen.The Galápagos Islands are made up of sixty-one different islands and, while they are all worth exploring, the island of San Cristobal is the most traveler friendly. Here’s my experience at Golden Bay Hotel & Spa on San Cristobal island in the Galápagos!The ResortThe Golden Bay Hotel & Spa is located in the very small and quaint town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on the island of San Cristobal. It’s totally walkable so you can easily explore anything and everything in the area.Hello, eco-luxury!The island’s newest luxury hotel is chic, cozy, and the perfect base for exploring the area. There are only twenty-one rooms at the hotel, so there’s never a crowded area, and you always get rock star treatment. There is a rooftop Jacuzzi with a world-class view, an incredible restaurant, and everything else that you need for a dream stay on the islands.The RoomsStylish and chic, the rooms here overlook the harbor. You can look out your window and spot one of the local sea lions pretty much any day of the year.Like the rest of the Golden Bay, each room has a clean white and shabby chic vibe. Far from the sterile feel that some luxury places have, this place is effortlessly cool.…and can we talk about that bath tub?!The DivingThere are tons of dive sites off of the island of San Cristobal. The most famous site of all is Kicker Rock, a.k.a. León Dormido. This site is the remains of a volcanic cone, and its formation of monolithic rock jets up an amazing 500 feet above the ocean.Home to abundant wildlife, this spot is stunning both above and below sea level.I went out to the spot with a team from Scuba Eden Dive Shop. I was really impressed with the crew, which had bilingual dive masters who showed us exactly where to go. The area is teeming with hammerheads, eagle rays, reef sharks, and the Galápagos sharks, so there’s a lot to see in the area.Definitely a top diving destination in my book!The FoodGolden Bay has an amazing restaurant on property, which is always a perk when you aren’t in a major city. A mix of Ecuadorian and traditional island cuisine, the food here is fresh and original. Be sure to try the ceviches Galapagueños.They’re a local specialty and crazy tasty.Best of all, the restaurant caters to any sort of food requirements. Whether you’re vegan or have a food allergy, it has you covered. Just let the restaurant’s staff know when you book, and it will make sure that you’ve got an expansive menu to choose from when you arrive.The Panoramic Terrace Snack Bar is a great spot to catch a sunset and chill after a long day of diving and sightseeing. They’ve got freshly baked pizza and a range of other quick eats. It’s definitely the kind of place where you’ll want to lounge long after you’re done eating.ActivitiesSan Cristobal is the best island for solo exploration. Unlike most of the Galápagos, you don’t need a tour guide to get around here. There are definitely some great local tours, but it’s nice to be able to just wander around and take pics of the gorgeous scenery.If diving isn’t your thing, make sure to check out a snorkeling day trip!On top of natural beauty, the area has an interesting culture.You won’t want to spend much time indoors, but do be sure to check out the San Cristobal Interpretation Center. It’s a free attraction and there’s so much there to see. Learning about the history and ecosystems of the island makes all of the sites much more meaningful!Read More: The Ultimate Galápagos Islands Travel GuideMore InformationHotel: Golden Bay Hotel & SpaLocation: Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, San Cristobal, GalápagosAccommodation: Eco, LuxuryPrice Range: $$$Want to earn points for your hotel stays and earn miles toward your next adventure?Don’t miss the video from my experience in the Galápagos!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/one-day-guide-to-tallinn-estonia/,"A One-Day Guide to Exploring Tallinn, Estonia",Estonia,"Hey there, I’m Michelle Halpern, founder and editor behind the travel blog Live Like it’s the Weekend. I write about global women’s travel and love exploring everything from local adventures in my home state of California to more off the beaten track spots across the world like Estonia!Recently on a trip to Europe, I had the opportunity to do a day trip to Tallinn, Estonia while I was visiting Helsinki, Finland. I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect, but the second we landed in the charming Old Town, I knew one day was going to be too little time.The good news, however, is that Tallinn is pretty small and quite walkable, so while you’ll likely want to stay for much longer, you can still see most of Tallinn’s top highlights in a day.I’m sharing all my favorite spots we visited—from where to eat, where to shop and where to get the best views of this city.Here’s how to do a day trip to the picturesque city of Tallinn, Estonia!  How to Do A Day Trip to  TallinnFrom Helsinki, taking a ferry to Tallinn is only a 2-hour ride and some change, so it’s very easy to do a day trip to Estonia.We chose to book tickets on the Tallink Silja Line, which is the size of a cruise ship and has various seating options for the journey including comfortable business class seats with an unlimited food buffet—yes, please!The gates for the ferry close 30 minutes before departure, so just make sure to get there at least 45 minutes prior.Helpful Tip:Once you arrive in Tallinn, there are lockers located at the ferry terminal which makes it super convenient for you to store some stuff for the day. So if you bring any gear or entertainment for the 2-hour ferry ride that you don’t want to lug around all throughout Tallinn, just store it and pick it back up before departure time.What  to Do in Tallinn, EstoniaThere are tons of awesome things to do in Tallinn! This overview will give you a mix of highlights and top historical spots, plus a must-do in the more modern area of the city. These can definitely all be done in a single day!St. Catherine’s PassageOne of the most famous streets in Tallinn, this 700-year-old alleyway has retained its medieval vibe through the years.It’s now home to a restaurant and several artisan shops where you can witness local craftsmen making unique items like glassware and ceramics.The Kohtuotsa Viewing PlatformThis is where you’ll find the money shots overlooking Tallinn. It takes some walking and there are a few steep inclines, but the views are worth it! Plus, you’ll get to see the juxtaposition between the Old Town and the new city from this vantage point.Raekoja PlatsThis is the main town square in the heart of Tallinn’s Old Town. I wouldn’t recommend eating all your meals here as it can be overpriced, but it’s a must to visit and to use as a reference point as you explore the city on foot.  Balti Jamaa MarketBalti Jamaa MarketFor a taste of modern life in Tallinn and to get a bit off the tourist track, Balti Jamaa market is a fun spot to peruse. It’s basically a massive market located within a warehouse barn, and houses everything under the sun from antique shops and vintage clothing sellers to food markets, beauty stores and everything in between.  St. Alexander Nevsky CathedralOne of the most iconic structures in Tallinn is this cathedral situated up on Toompea Hill. Built in 1900, the cathedral is one of the most unique buildings in the city and is a must for architecture and history lovers as it was designed by famous Russian architect Mikhail Preobrazhenski when Estonia was still part of the tsarist empire.  St. Vitus BrewingWhere to Eat & Drink in TallinnOlde HansaDon’t be fooled by Old Hansa’s proximity to the tourist-centric Old Town square and medieval garment wearing servers. This restaurant has over 5,000 Google reviews for a reason—it’s that good! Make sure to try their honey beer.St. Vitus BrewingA visit to St. Vitus is well worth the slight trek outside of Tallinn’s Old Town for a refreshing craft beer. This is one of those locals-only spots that will make you feel like you stumbled on a little secret. Located in the neighborhood of Telliskvi, this spot has over 20 different craft brews to choose from.DEPOOAnother spot a bit outside of the Old Town is DEPOO, located in one of the more trendy Tallinn neighborhoods. An old locomotive depot that’s been converted into shipping container food stalls, this is a great place to mix and mingle with the younger residents of Tallinn and enjoy lunch outside in the sun.   Roasted AlmondsYou can’t go to Tallinn and not try their delicious sweet and spiced roasted almonds being served everywhere you look in the Old Town square. Sure, it’s touristy and yes, probably overpriced. But delicious and worth it? Absolutely.   View from Kohtuotsa Viewing PlatformHelpful Tips for Visiting TallinnThe best time of year to visit Tallinn is from May to September when the weather is at its warmest and the city is in peak festival season. With the great weather though comes the crowds, so expect many tourists during this time of year. Tallinn is also known for its charming Christmas markets, so holiday time is also an ideal time to visit.During crowded times of the year, Tallinn experiences a lot of tour group traffic from incoming day cruises. If you want to get the best shots around town, visit the top sites on off hours to avoid the herds!Estonia’s currency is the Euro but you don’t need a lot of cash as credit cards are accepted almost everywhere. Don’t forget to pack good walking shoes—most of Tallinn’s Old Town can be explored on foot, and many of the streets are made from cobblestone.Fun Facts About  TallinnTallinn is the capital of Estonia whose Old Town subdistrict is actually a designated UNESCO World Heritage Site.Tallinn is a port city on the Gulf of Finland with regular routes servicing cities like Helsinki, Stockholm, and St. Petersburg. In fact, Tallinn is just 51 miles from Helsinki!Up until 1918, Tallinn was known by its historical German name, Reval. I hope you enjoyed this one day guide to Tallinn, Estonia!

Getting to spend five days exploring Giza and Cairo was an unforgettable experience. Soaking in the culture and getting a first-hand sight of a place with such a rich and dynamic culture was truly unforgettable.And the photo ops…oh, the photo ops!Being able to see the only remaining one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World is such a rare treat. And it’s one that needs to be thoroughly documented!To get the iconic photos you’re after with the pyramids in the background or smooching the Sphinx, you need to be strategic to get a great shot.Since it’s a major tourist destination, that means there are usually tourists surrounding… The good news? You can get creative with your angles to take amazing photos—even with the crowds! A few essential tips will allow you to snap amazing photos at the Pyramids of Giza without spending hours searching for the “right” spots.Ready to say cheese? Here is how to get amazing photos at the Pyramids of Giza.Helpful Tips for Visiting the Giza PyramidsGet There EarlyThis is a key strategy both for avoiding the rush of tourists and beating the sometimes unbearable heat. The gates open at 8 am and there are a lot of perks to being the first one in the door.Most tour buses arrive around 10 am. I would definitely recommend getting there two hours ahead of time to avoid as many crowds as possible and let yourself time to soak it all in. If you are coming in the summer, getting in before the afternoon heat is so important.Summer temps can reach 100 degrees F with no shade from the harsh sun so it feels intensely hot, especially when you’re trying to explore and do a lot of walking.Check out my guide on the best time to visit Egypt so you can see every site at its prime.Avoid FridaysFridays are the holy days in Egypt rather than Sundays. While the Pyramids of Giza are still open on Fridays, they are packed. Pretty much everyone in the Middle East is off work on Fridays so expect things to get seriously crowded.Be Aware of “Helpers”There is no way around it, once you are inside the Giza Complex, people are going to be hassling you. If they see you’ve got camera gear, they can get pushy in their attempt to bring you to the best spots for photos. They are just there for a bit of cash and are very unlikely to give useful advice.Helpful Tip:Egypt can be a bit of a culture shock, especially if you’ve never visited the Middle East before. Come prepared with my ten tips for your first trip to Egypt.  Spot #1 Spot #2 Photo Spot: The SphinxOnce you’ve left the parking lot, you’ll wind around past some vendors and through an old stone walkway. It should be easy to follow—just walk towards the Sphinx.Spot #1: Before walking into the ticketed entrance to the Sphinx, you can walk to an empty dirt lot to get a head-on shot.Spot #2: Enter the ticketed area for the Sphinx. For a side or back view, walk up the slope and past the face of The Sphinx to get a prime shot.You can kiss the Sphinx or position yourself so the Sphinx kisses your cheek!  Photo Spot: The Great PyramidThe Great Pyramid of Khufu has its own massive parking lot, so you will likely need to drive between locations.You might be overwhelmed by the number of people you see in front of the pyramid. You will be facing the tomb entrance side of the pyramid, which is the most crowded. Keep on walkin’!I suggest walking clockwise around the pyramid.As soon as I got to the first far corner, I was already able to get shots without people. Walk a little farther and you’ll soon find a nearly desolate backside of the Great Pyramid! Photo Spot: PanoramaThis location is actually on Google Maps. Just search “Giza Panorama.” Again, I’d suggest driving to this spot as it’s a pretty far trek with or without a camel.From the panorama, you can get a great shot of the entire complex. You can also hop a camel from this point and ride to a backside vantage point of the Queen’s Pyramids.Talk about a serious view!! I’ve said it before but I’m going to say it again—make sure to allow ample time to soak it all in. Here an op, there an op!There are photo ops all around the Giza complex! This shot was from a turnoff in the road driving from the Great Pyramid to the Panorama spot. Photo Spot: Queen’s PyramidsWhile you can walk from the Panorama to the backside of the complex to get a view of the Queen’s Pyramids, it is a bit far—however, the Panorama is a major point for hiring a camel ride and it’s pretty inexpensive.It’s really up to you! Photo Spot: SunsetI’d highly recommend hanging out with a camel for the afternoon (or evening). Not only will you get pics with the camels, but you will be able to take a shot from the distance. Just come prepared to be in the presence of a quite odiferous animal (and, hey, who is feeling fresh after walking the desert all day?).If you’re not up for the camel, there are buggy ride options too that will give you a dream photo op.Heads up, the Giza Complex does typically close between 4 and 5 pm (depending on the season), so you’ll definitely want a guide to explore the perimeter and learn more about it. Interested in Hiring My Recommended Egypt Tour Guide?

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-visiting-the-pyramids-of-giza/,The Ultimate Guide to Visiting the Pyramids of Giza,Egypt,"Egypt is one of the most fascinating places in the world. With a profoundly rich history, this is a bucket-list destination for so many.I finally got the chance to visit for a “sampler platter” tour of Egypt and see the famous Giza Pyramids. This is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing and I’ve always wanted to see it up close and personal.Ready to experience the magic that has fascinated the world for thousands of years? Here is the ultimate guide to visiting the Pyramids of Giza!About  the Giza ComplexThe area known as the Giza Complex includes the Giza Necropolis, Sphynx, Pyramids, and Valley Temple of Khafre.Nearly 5,000 years ago, Memphis was the capital of Egypt and Giza served as the burial grounds for the royals. The three pyramid complexes were created in honor of their kings. The oldest of the Pyramids of Giza were built all the way back in 2613-2498 BC and there are so many different layers of meaning surrounding them.The pyramids are located on the west side of the Nile River because this is the side the sun sets on. Back thousands of years ago, Egyptians believed that the living should be on the east side where the sun rises while the dead should be on the other side.   When to GoOf course, the Pyramids of Giza are a HUGE attraction. For this reason, I’d highly recommend going during an off time.Going during the winter will help you beat the crowds (and the summers can be seriously hot!). Whichever time of year you opt to go, start your day early. Head over to the Egyptian Museum first thing in the morning.The tour buses arrive between 9:30 to 10:30 every morning. They head straight to the pyramids so you can explore the museum solo while they are seeing the Pyramids. Once you are done in the museum, the pyramids will have cleared out a bit and are prime for exploration.The Giza Plateau is open from 8 am to 4 pm daily (stretched out to 5 pm during the summer). You will absolutely want the full day to explore so come early.Keep in mind that Cairo is a highly polluted city. It does clear up a bit later in the day so you’ll have a better view of the pyramids if you don’t arrive first thing.Read More: How to Get Amazing Photos at the Pyramids of GizaHelpful Tip:For planning travel around the whole country, read my guide to the Best Time to Travel to Egypt.   How to Get  ThereIn photos, the Giza Pyramids tend to look like they are endless miles down a dusty path but they are actually quite central. In fact, they’re only about 15 miles outside of downtown Cairo.I’d highly recommend getting a guide or driver to explore the pyramids. It’ll make your day so much better and you’ll get more insight. However, if you prefer to go it solo, you can easily find a wide range of bus and taxi options or you can take an Uber. Check out my 10 Tips for Your First Trip to Egypt for details on what to expect.Interested in Hiring My Recommended Guide?

You’ll also get infrequent emails with access to travel updates, giveaways and more! What  to ExpectThere are two points of entry into the Giza Complex, one is near the Great Pyramid of Giza and the other is beside The Sphinx. If you’re taking the bus, you’ll want to use the entry/exit near the Great Pyramid. Otherwise, it doesn’t really matter which one you use as you’ll want to explore the full area.You’ll definitely find crowds, especially near the main entrances. I’d encourage you to wander off the beaten path. You can appreciate the pyramids on a deeper level when you find some peace and quiet. You’ll also find some great angles and uncrowded landscapes for pics.Entry tickets are 120 LE (about $7.40 USD) or 60LE for students ($3.70 USD). If you want to explore inside of the Great Pyramid, you will pay an extra 300 LE (about $18.50 USD). If you are bringing a tripod, you’ll pay an extra 20 LE ($1.20 USD)—this may seem a bit odd but it’s very common in Egypt! Top Things to See and DoGreat PyramidTake a Photo with the SphynxLookout PointHang Out with a CamelVisit at Sunset by CamelWatch the Light Show at NightSee the Khufu Ship (Ancient Egyptian ship used to transport to the afterlife, it was once buried near the Great Pyramid and is now in a museum)   The Great Pyramid of GizaGoing Inside the Great PyramidIf you are claustrophobic, you might want to think twice about going deep into the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Great Gallery is ultra-narrow and you will feel like the walls are closing in. That said, if you’re comfortable in closed spaces, it’s totally worth it.When you go to enter, you will need to leave your camera and phone at the entry. You will get a ticket for it, and be sure to hold onto it because it’s essential for getting your stuff back. I’d recommend just leaving all your excess gear there while you explore.Everyone has different preferences, but I skipped going inside the Great Pyramid. If it’s your first time to Egypt, check out my 10 Tips for Your First Trip to Egypt—I talk about my top things to do and what to skip…and personally I would skip going inside.Helpful Tip:Before you drop your stuff, do bring a few tissues in your pocket. It can be super hot and humid inside. Combine this with a dusty desert environment and it’s good to be able to wipe off your face and hands.

https://theblondeabroad.com/5-day-egypt-itinerary-for-cairo-and-the-pyramids/,5-Day Egypt Itinerary for Cairo and the Pyramids,Egypt,"Egypt had been at the top of my bucket list for ages, but I was worried about traveling there solo, especially as a woman. While I’ve been dying to explore it from top to bottom, I decided to sneak in a quick trip with the limited time I had.While the pyramids tend to steal the show, those are just one of Egypt’s many wonders. To truly dive into Ancient Egypt, it’s essential to get down to the Valley of the Kings (typically via a flight).For that magical adventure, I am waiting until I have at least a solid week (or ideally two) to explore—because I want to soak it ALL in!However, if you are on a limited timeframe and want a “sampler platter” of Egypt—like yours truly—you can still see the pyramids of Giza, explore Cairo, and make a day trip to Alexandria all in just a few days!Ready for an unforgettable adventure?Here’s my 5-day Egypt itinerary for Cairo and the pyramids!When to Visit EgyptI spent five days exploring Egypt in the spring soaking in as much as I could of Cairo, the Giza complex, and Alexandria (up the northern coast).The weather in Egypt is nice for most of the year but it does get a bit sticky. Before you go, read up on the best time to travel to Egypt. Guides in EgyptAs a solo female traveler, I actually prefer to travel and do most things on my own. However, I have found, in certain places, I get SO MUCH MORE when I hire a guide that knows the local area! For Egypt, this was crucial as there’s such a rich history. I definitely recommend getting a guide, however, not all guides are created equal.You can check out my essential tips for your trip to Egypt here and get my guide information!  Al-Azhar Park - Citadel View Alain Le NotreDay 1 – Old Cairo and Coptic CairoWhile Egypt is a primarily Muslim country, there have also always been Christians and they have their own dynamic culture. Coptic Christians are a sect similar to the Eastern Orthodox people that you find in Eastern Europe.To experience Coptic Cairo, you will want to go to Abu Serga Church and the Hanging Church.They are beautiful sites that are central to Egyptian Christian life. While the Jewish community is smaller, you will also want to be sure to make time to see one of Cairo’s most beautiful synagogues: Ben Ezra Synagogue.Old Cairo, also known as Masr al-Qadima in Arabic or Historic/Islamic Cairo, was, in my opinion, the most beautiful part of the city.Obviously, the buildings are older, so you have more unique architecture vs modern Cairo’s big modern buildings.If you have a local guide with you, ask them about this area. There are so many nooks and crannies to explore. Old Cairo has seen such a complex history over the past 1000+ years, you can barely scrape the surface in a short visit.  Wherever your day takes you, watch the sunset from Al-Azhar Park to get a stunning view of Old Cairo. It is one of the most picture-perfect views of the city. It feels like you’re in the movie Aladdin!Also, it’s also a great place to grab a bite to eat!We had lunch on the terrace of Citadel View restaurant and the views are amazing. The park is also quite big and beautiful to stroll around.Helpful Tip:Listen to podcasts, watch documentaries and do some reading before going to Egypt so that you can appreciate what you’re looking at even more!   Giza Complex  Day 2 – Pyramids of Giza and SaqqaraThe trip from Cairo to Giza is a quick 20-minute drive, but traffic can be insane, so plan accordingly. My advice? Get over to Giza early in the day, as close to the time it opens, to avoid the crows.The Giza complex closes at 2:00 pm and you will want to be able to take your time.Giza is where you will see the Sphynx and the ancient pyramids. While the Sphynx has a designated viewing area, the best photos are from the dirt plot before you enter the ticketed area. Here, you’ll get a full-frontal view with the Sphynx and Great Pyramid behind it.For the pyramids, there’s a more “open” concept to visiting. There are countless spots for great photos, but the one place I would avoid is the entrance to the Great Pyramid. There are hoards of tourists, for obvious reasons.If you simply circle the pyramid clockwise, you’ll be able to get some snaps with less or even no other people.Then, be sure to drive further out so you can get a nice distant vantage point for a view of the entire pyramid complex.I’d recommend exploring Giza until you are ready for lunch then head to Saqqara, the Ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis.Read More: How To Get Amazing Photos at the Pyramids of Giza  Saqqara Entrance   There is only one pyramid in Saqqara so you shouldn’t need more than an hour here. Saqqara is the very first pyramid the Egyptians built!Again, listening to a quick podcast or watching a short documentary on the Saqqara pyramid (before you go) will make this visit a LOT more interesting.After your visit, you will have the evening free to relax or head out for a taste of Cairo’s nightlife. Alternatively, you could head back to Giza for a camel ride at sunset (which I opted for)!Can one really get too much of the pyramids?  Museum of Egyptian Antiquities Narmer Palette Entrance to the Museum Day 3 – Egyptian Museum and the CitadelThe Egyptian Museum, also known as the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities or Museum of Cairo is a must. There you will see treasures from King Tutankhamun, also known as the ‘Boy King.’You don’t want to miss the museum. It has the largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities in the world!I’ve been obsessed with Egyptian history since I was a child so this was a serious dream come true! Other than the Rosetta Stone, the Narmer Palette is one of the most important archeological finds. It depicts the first-ever unification of Upper and Lower Eygpt by King Narmer.While the Egyptian Museum is historic, Cairo is opening the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) and is going to be truly epic.Visitors will soon be able to visit the GEM and walk to the Giza pyramid complex from the museum. I can’t wait to return and immerse myself in all of the ancient Egyptian goodness!Next up: The Citadel of Salah El-Din is located in the heart of the city center as well and it is a must-see. It’s a medieval Islamic-era fortification and it’s seriously impressive!  While you’re at the Citadel, you won’t want to miss Mosque of Muhammad Ali Pasha (located within the Citadel)—it’s got incredible views and is well worth the visit.  Alexandria  Day 4 – Alexandria Day TripAlexandria, a Mediterranean port city, is the second-largest city in Egypt. It is about a 2.5-hour drive from Cairo and is well worth the trip. Alexandria has a rich Roman history and a stunning location.Here, you can visit the Roman catacombs, explore the temple complex, and visit the Pompey’s Pillar.I’m especially fascinated by the Library of Alexandria! It existed long ago, for over 2,000 years, and housed the most important recordings of human history and research. Today we have no idea what happened to it—where the scrolls went, or where it was located…DUN  DUN  DUN!While it’s not the “original” ancient Library of Alexandria. There is a new library of Alexandria that is worth visiting! Day 5 – Khan el Khalili Souk and DepartureThe Khan el Khalili Souk is a popular stop for visitors. For me, stopping at papyrus and rug shops with my guide felt *too* touristy. The sales staff made me feel pressured to buy something in these shops and I just wasn’t in the market for either.If you ARE looking for rugs or papyrus, but want to skip the tourist trap, this is the perfect place. You’ll also find a ton of other local handicrafts and souvenirs while getting to experience a local souk.  Giza Complex at SunsetOptional  Things (If You Have Time)I didn’t do much in the evenings as I was traveling alone and only hired a guide for my day trips.So, if you want to explore Cairo more in your free evenings, there is a light show at the Giza Pyramids that is meant to be quite cool.And a Felucca Boat Ride will take you on a gorgeous trip down the Nile. 10 Tips for Your First Trip to EgyptBefore you start packing, don’t miss my 10 Tips for Your First Trip to Egypt!

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-travel-to-egypt/,The Best Time to Travel to Egypt,Egypt,"Egypt is one of the most mysterious destinations on the planet and it’s been on the top of my bucket list for AGES. Now that I’ve been, I’m 100% convinced that it should be on the top of everyone’s bucket list. Between the Nile, the Red Sea, Alexandria, Cairo, and pyramids that date back to 2500 BC, there’s so much history and culture to experience.Because the landscape is primarily desert, picking the perfect time to go can be a bit tricky. I visited this past April and although it was warm, it wasn’t unbearable by any means.So, if you’re interested in visiting this mystic country, check out this guide to the best time to travel to Egypt!And don’t miss my 5-day itinerary for Cairo and the Pyramids!  The Pyramids at GizaMarch to MaySpringtime in Egypt is one of the most popular times to visit. The weather is warmer but it’s still quite pleasant. April and May are also considered to be the best months to enjoy the Red Sea for diving, swimming, and soaking up the Egyptian sun.However, there is a chance you will experience the Khamsin Wind—a minor yet hot sandstorm that sweeps through Egypt during April and May.In April, Sham al Nessim, a Coptic festival, celebrates the arrival of spring. This occurs every year on Easter according to the Coptic calendar and is celebrated with picnics in parks and on riverbanks throughout Egypt.  June to AugustIn summer, temperatures reach an average of 95 degrees and are met with extremely intense humidity. If you’re willing to face the heat, this is one of the best times to visit the country as many people choose to avoid it.Let’s face it, climbing into a tomb in 100-degree weather can be very draining and many of the top attractions are located in the southern part of Egypt, which is even warmer than Cairo. But don’t let me scare you away from it yet.If your hotel has air conditioning and a swimming pool or you fancy cruising up the Nile, you’ll have a very enjoyable time. This is especially true if you are staying at a Red Sea resort, where the temps typically only reach to be around 84 degrees.Tourists aren’t expected to fast, but many businesses close for much of the day; keep in mind that many cafes and restaurants don’t even open their doors during the daylight. At the end of the month of fasting, Muslims celebrate at Eid al Fitr (Feast of Sacrifice), a religious festival that lasts for four days.Read More: The Ultimate Egypt Travel Guide  10 Tips for Egypt Read More!September to OctoberMuch like spring, fall in Egypt brings cooler temperatures and affordable prices. Though it’s still warm out, the sea breeze picks up, making it much more bearable. The Mediterranean Sea is still warm yet uncrowded so beach conditions are ideal.During September, Wafaa Al Nil—the ancient festival devoted to the Nile River—is celebrated. The festival is filled with art competitions, poetry readings, concerts, and scientific discussions about health and pollution.  Egyptian Museum of AntiquitiesNovember to FebruaryWinter is the peak season for tourism in Egypt. Because the weather has cooled, tourists flock to the ancient sites, making the lines longer and the hotel prices skyrocket. During Christmas and New Years, hotels and cruises raise their rates significantly and they book up far in advance so you’ll want to plan accordingly.Winter also means a lot of festivals in Egypt, the first being Coptic Christmas which takes place on January 7th. At midnight, worshippers gather for mass and enjoy a feast together. The Abu Simbel Festival is held on February 22nd every year and it is a celebration of the eponymous temple.Regardless of when in winter you decide to visit, pack long-sleeved shirts, jeans, and a jacket. The evenings can get extremely chilly.OverallThough it may not seem like it, Egypt is a year-round destination depending on your ideal activities during your visit.This biggest thing to keep in mind while visiting is Ramadan, a holy month of fasting. While the last years Ramadan has been in May, June, and July—it can actually fall at any time of the year due to the differences in the Muslim calendar vs the Western calendar. So make sure to check on this!Whether you’re looking to lounge by the sea, visit the ancient pyramids, or soak up the celebration of the Egyptian festivals, there’s a time to visit for absolutely everyone! "

I’ve always been a history buff and since I was little, I dreamt of visiting the Nile and the pyramids. Though I will admit that I was a little hesitant due to concerns for safety and the experiences I’ve heard from other women.I did my research and learned tons about the country and went in with an open mind.And guess what? I met some of the friendliest locals you could ever imagine and got to see places I’ve only dreamed of! But like I said, I definitely did my research beforehand—here are my 10 tips for your first trip to Egypt!I was glad I learned more about the history and culture before I went, otherwise I feel like some of the most interesting details might’ve gotten lost with the whirlwind of all that I was seeing. Let me tell you, Egypt did not disappoint (though I did almost get my drone confiscated—but that’s a story for another time!). There are so many fascinating places to visit!You absolutely shouldn’t miss the chaotic capital of Cairo or the sheer depth of history you’ll find at the Pyramids of Giza. Oh, and you’ll definitely want to venture down the Red Sea at Luxor. Don’t miss out on taking a magical Nile cruise, either!I was in Eygpt at the tail-end of April and it was already pretty warm but breezy, and the main attractions were relatively quiet. For those that are planning a trip to Egypt, I’d recommend avoiding stifling summer months if possible when the temperatures can really soar.

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-egypt/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Egypt,Egypt,"Egypt occupied a top spot on my bucket list for ages. With such a rich history and unique culture, it has always fascinated me. However, I’ll be honest. I’d been holding off on traveling to Egypt because of the stories I’d heard of women having negative experiences there.While I’d always argue that other people’s travel experiences don’t predict your own, I was hesitant to visit Egypt.There’s no wrong or right way to travel—that’s for sure. And one person’s experience doesn’t automatically mean that it’s going to be the same for someone else. Good or bad. I appreciate honest accounts of travel experiences because it helps me understand when I really need to do my research and decide if it’s the right destination for me or not.Some destinations I feel totally comfortable traveling to on a whim without doing an ounce of research. But, even with so much confidence in myself traveling on my own, there are still some places I research tirelessly and make plans to ensure my safety.This was one of those places.I’m so happy that I had such a positive experience on my first trip to Egypt. I met so many insanely friendly locals (a total stranger literally handed me their baby) and got to live out my lifelong dream of seeing the creations of Ancient Egyptians with my own two eyes.Ready for a once in a lifetime experience? Here are my top ten tips for your first trip to Egypt!And don’t forget to check out my Ultimate Egypt Travel Guide!How to Get Your Visa for EgyptFor American citizens traveling to Egypt, you can get a visa on arrival. You’ll need to have $25 cash and you’ll need to pay for your visa at a special window before you go through immigration.I booked a guide before I arrived, which was handy because the company already had my visa ready and took me through a VIP line!  Forget the DroneDo not bring a drone to Egypt! I knew in advance that drones were illegal to fly, but I didn’t realize they weren’t allowed in the country. Big mistake!I was detained at the airport and questioned for three hours!It doesn’t matter if your drone never leaves your suitcase. You will have issues if you try to bring it in.  Pyramids of GizaBrush Up on the History of Ancient EgyptBefore arriving in Egypt, spend some time reading up on the history of Ancient Egypt. I found that many tour guides didn’t dig very deep. They covered a basic level of ancient Egyptian history and even gave me some incorrect information.You’ll appreciate the sights so much more if you have a deeper understanding of the history of places you’re visiting.I’d recommend listening to the “History of Egypt” Podcast before you go. If you’re traveling to Cairo and Giza, you’ll get pretty much everything you need in Episodes 1-5.The library in Alexandria’s website also has some really cool resources like a step-by-step guide to reading Hieroglyphics. I also found this Ancient Egypt website quite helpful. You can search by monument, dynasty, king, and queen. I like that there isn’t so much information that it’s overwhelming.I continued to reference the Podcast and website once I was in Egypt too!   Hire a Guide if You’re Traveling SoloWhen I was planning to travel solo in Egypt, I didn’t think twice about getting a guide. I wanted to feel safe and thought I would get a lot more out of traveling in a place with such a rich history with an expert.I found having a guide made my experience SO much better. I never got harassed. Never felt uncomfortable. Never had an issue getting anywhere or questioning where to go.However, I did feel a bit like I was being shuffled between the most well-known attractions without digging as deep as I would have liked. It felt a bit routine, like the guides sort of did the same thing for all tourists. I got a surface level briefing, went to touristy restaurants, and only saw “well-marked” attractions.I’ll cover my tips to avoid this in the next section!Helpful Tip: Note that the max withdrawal at most ATMs is $250 USD. You’ll need cash at most places around Egypt, so be sure to carry it with you at all times.A great tour guide!Research to Find the Right Guide for YouI take responsibility for my not-so-great guide experience. Normally, I plan every last detail of my travels from sightseeing to the restaurants. But, because I decided to hire a guide, I trusted that they would plan the best possible itinerary for me.After speaking to quite a few people, I’ve found that Egypt might be unique in that, yes, you want a guide, but you should still be pro-active in planning your own itinerary.When I return to Egypt, I will still hire a guide, but will clearly disclose that I’m looking for more of a chaperone than a tourist guide. I loved having a local with me, but I think I would have done a better job of sightseeing and going to the places that actually interested me if I had done my research and planned my own itinerary (like I normally do).I did so much research on the history that I found it a bit frustrating to expect more of my guide than they could give.If you LOVE trying new foods when traveling, research restaurants so you can eat at non-touristy places. As a foodie, I was dying to try local dishes but was really only taken to tourist spots.All of that being said, there are AMAZING guides in Egypt. You just have to do your research. I was actually referred to a guide that is known to be very knowledgable and personable (featured in the picture above), but he was fully-booked and hosting other guests. He was only free one night and took me on a sunset trip to Giza.I honestly got more information from him in 1 night than I did in 4 days with other guides.So, do your research and establish what’s most important to you before you go. If you are looking for a guide simply to feel safe and secure but like planning your own trips, make sure you take that responsibility in your own hands and share your wishes with the company. If you’re looking for someone to enrich your experience with a deep understanding of Ancient Egypt, do your research.Interested in Hiring My Recommended Guide?

She is running an incredible dive + yoga retreat in Egypt this September! There aren’t many spots remaining so be sure to apply asap!   What to See in EgyptEgypt is such a diverse and beautiful country. There are countless ways to plan an itinerary for Egypt. I took a short trip to Egypt, basing myself in Cairo and exploring the nearby sights. While there is SO much more to see in Egypt and you could spend weeks there, here is my 5-day “sample platter” itinerary for Cairo and the pyramids!Some highlights when basing yourself in Cairo include:Pyramids of GizaSaqqara PyramidCoptic CairoEgyptian Museum of AntiquitiesMosque of Muhammad AliAlexandria Day TripKhan el Khalili SoukIf you have 2+ weeks, your options are really endless. Look into taking a Nile cruise, or flying down to Aswan and Luxor (where most of the ancient Egyptian ruins are). You can also look into diving the Red Sea if you love scuba diving. There are dive resorts and liveaboard options to make all your underwater dreams come true!Mind the Traffic in CairoCairo is a busy city with more than 15 million people. The traffic is crazy, and it is something you must plan around.If you are traveling pretty much anywhere in Cairo, make sure to give yourself plenty of time to get around. I would definitely opt to NOT drive yourself. It’s much easier to hire a driver, or even use Uber. Also, make sure you buy a comprehensive travel insurance policy!Another thing to be aware of is that not all license plates will have numbers that you’ll recognize.The Best Time to Visit EgyptThe summers can get crazy hot in Egypt, and if you visit in July or August, the heat is oppressive, making it difficult to explore. I think the best time to visit Egypt is in the winter months (November to January).The temps usually reach around 70 degrees F in the afternoon, but it’s also high season for the country. Plan your trip well in advance so you can avoid the seasonal increase in flights, tours, and accommodation as much as possible.I visited Egypt in April, which is spring and also a shoulder season. The temperatures were warm and windy, but the heat of the summer months had yet to kick in. There were also far fewer people at top attractions like the Pyramids of Giza.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Egypt  Pyramids of GizaWhat to Do (and What to Skip!)This is very subjective and everyone is different! However, here are some of my favorite experiences and ones I found a little anti-climactic.Skip the Tour Shops: Your average tour guide will drag you through papyrus, Egyptian cotton, and Egyptian rug shops. Unless these are things you desperately want to purchase, insist on not going. They’re a complete waste of time and the guides usually get a kick-back for bringing you there (which is the only reason they take you there). They’re not interesting and are staged for tourists. Rather than suffer through an “as seen it on TV”-vibes demonstration, skip it.Skip Interior Pyramid Tours: Many pyramids let you go inside. I skipped this altogether. I heard beforehand that the insides were quite cramped and there wasn’t anything to see, so decide for yourself if you’re willing to wait in line and know that it might not be the most exciting thing you’ve ever seen.Try Local Restaurants: Find your own restaurants ahead of time. I’m a HUGE foodie and was actually really upset that I got taken to tourist restaurants. One of the restaurants I ate at was “ok,” but there were no locals. There are some great restaurants, so research ahead of time and request (or at least suggest and see if they agree it’s good) to have a bit more control over your experience.Visit the New Egyptian Museum: Set to open this year, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), AKA the Giza Museum, is going to be the largest archaeological museum in the world. I am dying to see this place! There will be 50,000 artifacts, including the first exhibition of King Tutankhamun’s full tomb collection. Bonus: Tips for Visiting the Egyptian Museum of AntiquitiesIf you visit before the new Egyptian museum is open, you can still visit the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities, built in 1835. If you love museums and are interested in ancient Egyptian history, I’d recommend allocating at LEAST 3 hours here.I visited the museum with a guide and felt rushed. Unless your guide is a major history buff, you’re better off going alone.I would have loved to spend all day at the museum. Everything was well labeled with information, so I personally didn’t find it beneficial to have a guide.If you want to dig deeper, do some research ahead of time. I’d also recommend looking for a podcast or app with an audio guide.Tip: Definitely go into the King Tut Exhibit at the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities. The Mummy Room costs extra but I thought it was interesting and money well spent. Do you have tips for first-time travelers going to Egypt? I’d love to hear your recommendations in the comments below!"

It has a culture and vibe unlike anywhere else in the country. In fact, it’s this regional diversity that first inspired me to want to travel the country from top to bottom.Each area is remarkably different with their own festivals, traditions, and, in the case of Catalonia, even its own local language.While the lesser-known destinations in Spain have their own charm, Barcelona is one of those essential European cities that you’ve just got to visit—and you can do so on a budget.

Walk a block in either direction and you’ll find much better choices.Helpful Tip:Before you go read my guide to affordable travel in Barcelona to get the most bang for your buck and experience local neighborhoods.  MERCADO DE LA BOQUERIAVisit La Boqueria MarketAt the heart of even the smallest towns in Spain, you’ll find a central market where all of the locals shop every day for the cupboard essentials.On La Rambla, you’ll find the famous market in all of Spain: La Boqueria Market.Full of local vendors selling fresh and seasonal fare, this is the perfect place to stock up for a picnic or simply grab a few bites on the go.Have a Long Leisurely Meal OutsideSoak up the sunshine!Spanish meals are an event and everybody loves to have them outside.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-barcelona-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Barcelona on a Budget,Spain,"One of the most vibrant cities of Europe, the Catalan capital is amongst the Mediterranean’s best destinations—and everybody knows it! Barcelona has become a tourist hotspot in recent years.While it’s still a city well worth visiting, you’ve got to plan ahead to avoid the tourist traps and keep on a budget.Fortunately, like many of the cities in Southern Europe, Barcelona is relatively affordable. If you’re coming from a major American city, you’ll find that the prices that locals pay in Barcelona can be quite a bit lower. You’ve just got to know where to find those local deals!Here are a few essential tips for traveling Barcelona on a budget.  Placa Reial (Royal Square), BarcelonaWhere to StayFirst off, forget about La Rambla! While this popular pedestrian street is worth a stroll, it’s not a good place to stay or eat. It’s overly crowded, expensive, and generally a bit generic.Likewise, the Gothic Quarter comes at a major premium. While you can find a few bargains in these central spots, they are few and far between. Luckily, there’s no need to stay in the absolute center of the city. Barcelona has an extensive public transport network so it’s easy to get around from pretty much anywhere in the city.Here are a few affordable places to stay in Barcelona that I love:Hostel One SantsIf you’re looking for a place to meet other travels, go for Hostel One Sants. They have an impressive range of activities, including bar crawls and a FREE dinner every night of the week. It’s less than a 15-minute walk to the Sants metro station, which gives easy access to the airport and everywhere else around the city.Hotel CuriousOne place in the center of the city that actually offers a great price is Hotel Curious. This affordable little spot is two minutes off La Rambla and will have you at Mercado de La Boqueria in five minutes. With free breakfast, clean and comfy rooms, and friendly staff, it’s an easy winner.Jam Hostel BarcelonaAnother area I love is the bohemian Gràcia neighborhood. For a relaxing space, go for the Jam Hostel Barcelona. They offer a choice of private and dorm rooms, morning yoga, and are only a 15-minute walk from La Sagrada Familia, Park Güell and Paseo de Gràcia.Sant Jordi GràciaAnother good space in Gràcia is the modern and cool Sant Jordi Gràcia. The place is spotless and air-conditioned (an important thing to look for in Spain in the summer!). There are tons of common spaces to spread out and meet other people so it’s another good pick for solo travelers.Safestay Barcelona GothicJust beside the Gothic neighborhood, you’ll find the trendy El Born area. In the heart of it all and not far from the beach, this is a good base. The Safestay Barcelona Gothic here gives you a good bang for your buck with the massive roof terrace and cozy living room.  Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');Visit During the Shoulder SeasonEurope is jam-packed with travelers in the summer. Particularly in July and August, the crowds in Barcelona are huge and the prices are sky-high. While a lot of travelers come to Barcelona in the summer to enjoy the fab weather, you can get good weather throughout much of the year.Just be aware that winter does get cold. During the coldest months, nights drop to a chilly 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).Being on the coast, Barcelona also sees its share of heavy downpours. Since the city is so focused on the outdoors (hello, sun-soaked plazas!), it is best to enjoy it during the warmer times of the year. Starting in April, afternoons get up to 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and they stay there until well into October.To maximize the weather while minimizing prices and crowds, opt for the couple of months on either side of summer. You’ll save some serious cash and have a better time across the board.Before you book, here is the best time to visit different regions across Spain.   Public TransportationAn Hola Barcelona Travel Card is the solution for getting around. It entitles you to unlimited travel across the city’s metro and bus network, as well as the RENFE suburban trains network.You can get these cards for 48, 72, 96 or 120 hours, and they’ll give you the freedom of the city.You can use this card to get to the airport even. It’s a major cost-cutter over buying individual cards or taking airport taxis.Barcelona Tourist CardIf it’s your first time visiting Barcelona, I’d highly recommend checking out the Barcelona Tourist Card. You can free unlimited public transit (including airport trips) and entry into museums.It’ll give you discounts on tours, shopping, and restaurants, along with the coveted ability to jump to the front of the line.Note: The standard tickets don’t include La Sagrada Familia, Park Güell, or other Gaudí attractions, but you can add-on separate tickets to save some cash.  Gaudi for LessBarcelona is all about Gaudí! While his attractions are impressive, most of them come at a price. If you just want to check out what all of the buzz is about but don’t want to invest too much time or cash, you can just have a walk by.Places like Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, and Parc Güell are picture-perfect from the exterior. And, honestly, if you’re not really into architecture, this is a good way to just have a look then move on.If you do opt to go inside, I’d suggest buying your tickets online!You’ll get a discount for Sagrada Familia, Casa Batlló, and Parc Güell while saving a lot of time waiting at the ticket counter and potentially facing sold out tickets.Read More: 10 Things You Must Do in Barcelona  Mercado de La BoqueriaTake Advantage of the Free ThingsThere are so many amazing things in Barcelona that are 100% gratis!MuseumsIf you’re there on a Sunday, hit the museums. All-day on the first Sunday of each month, and every Sunday between 3-8 pm, the majority of the city-operated museums are free.La BoqueriaWander through the Mercado de La Boqueria and snap pictures for free. It’s the perfect place to find inexpensive local veg, fruits, cheese, and ready-made snacks to pack for a picnic. Once you are all stocked up, head over to one of the stunning local parks.ParksParks like Ciutadella, Cervantes, and Palau Reial are must-visits. Walk down the beach then make your way up through the Gothic Quarter. You can wander through Parc Güell for free (it’s just the monument zone that’s paid).Free Walking TourI always love a free walking tour and Barcelona has one of the best! There are tons of them all day and night. Led by a local, you will get an insider view of the city and see all of the best spots. While tips are typically given at the end, it’s a smart way to ensure you’re only paying for the quality of experience you feel you’ve had.Cheap EatsRestaurantsSpain has some of the greatest food on the planet—you’ve just got to know where to look! Mercado de La Boqueria is one of the top spots to grab a bit on the go. I’d highly recommend getting over to Mercat de Santa Caterina or Mercat de Sant Antoni as well to shop like a local.Tip: Some of the stalls are cash only or have a surcharge for using cards. Be sure to arrive with at least a few euros in your pocket.Generally speaking, you don’t have to look far to find a great place to see. Just avoid La Rambla, where almost all the food is overpriced and disappointing.When you go for lunch, check for the menu del dia. Every day from 1 to 4 pm, you’ll find deals from 10-14 euros. And we’re not talking about a light lunch here!Lunch is traditionally the biggest meal of the day in Spain so you are probably looking at a three-course meal with wine.  10 Tapas to Try Order Up!Spanish FoodAs you explore the city, you’ll find tapas on every corner. Generally, Spanish people see these as a between-meal snack, but you can order two or three to make a meal out of it. They’re generally affordable but you’ll find some extravagant options.There are SO many options for tapa. Here are a few of my fave tapas you’ve got to try!Another must-try is pinchos. While tapas tend to come in small dishes, pinchos (or you’ll often see it as “pintxo”) are served on a stick. The Basque answer to tapas, these are typically just a bite or two.For the ultimate pincho experience, head to Blai Street in Poble Sec. You can do a slow pub crawl and sample a new pincho or two in each spot.Drinks in BarcelonaCava and vermut are the typical drinks of choice. While you will find sangria, it’s considered a thing for tourists. Sangria is more popular amongst locals in southern Spain and generally not made very well in Barcelona…though if you’re wanting to sample it, by all means, do!Spain is one of the biggest wine-producing countries on earth. That means the wine is not only world-class but cheap! You will find bodegas all over the city where you can fill up a jug for pocket change.You can bring along an empty water bottle (they charge by the liter so make sure it’s at least that size) or you can grab a refillable bottle for a small price. More often than not, they are happy to give you samples directly from the barrel so you can get an ultra-affordable wine tasting on the fly.Feeling inspired?

I’m not sure who makes up these days…but I want to be part of that team! I’m all for getting festive, so naturally, the only way to celebrate is by tasting all the tapas! When you first arrive in Spain, you might have paella on your mind (you know—that delicious rice dish cooked in a giant cast iron skillet and topped with a variety of seafood and meat?!). But, there are SO many other delicious foods to try in Spain… The Spaniards have mastered the way of bitesize meals. Whether that stems from eating dinner late, taking mid-day siestas, or simply wanting to sample a smattering of dishes: tapas are where it’s at!Tapas are arguably Spain’s greatest food invention. The Spanish have a motto, “eat when you drink, drink when you eat,” which is where tapas come in. Not meant to be a full meal, the idea is to order a different tapa each time you get a drink. Then everyone shares and it becomes a social experience.Now that’s something I can get behind!I know at first glance of a tapas menu, it might be a little overwhelming…there are so many options to choose from with unfamiliar names and ingredients. What are the essential tapas you should try while exploring Spain?I’m dishing up the goods below! Quick Guide to Ordering Tapas in SpainThe best time for tapas in Spain: 1:30-3pm or 8:30-10:30pm. Tapas are more like a snack and if you stick to the Spanish times listed above, you’ll generally get the freshest bites.Tapas are made to be eaten on the move—you’re not sitting for long at any one place, and oftentimes if the tapa bar is crowded, you’ll find yourself standing. This is perfectly normal!The best places to find good tapas are in tapas streets or neighborhoods—with several different tapas bars or taverns around each other.For an authentic experience, look for a bar with locals! Avoid ones labeled “tapas bar” and those with English menus.Lastly, order your drink before you order your tapas!Pan con TomatePan con tomate is a simple yet delicious tapa from Barcelona.It’s toasted bread with fresh grated tomatoes, olive oil, and salt. Simplicity is key for this dish and it’s known to be comfort food, Barcelona style. Jamon SerranoJamon Serrano is another easy yet tasty tapa. Jamon Serrano is a Spanish ham—similar to prosciutto, which you could use if making your own (although it is a bit more expensive). Along with the ham, you’ll find tomato and olive oil…sometimes it’s served atop bread, other times it’s more like a charcuterie spread!Tortilla Española Essentially it's a Spanish omelet.Made with eggs and potatoes and sometimes sprinkled with onion, chives, or garlic, this is typically found on the menu at almost any café in Spain.Add a side of fruit and sangria and you have the perfect brunch!Gambas al AjilloThis one is for all of you seafood and garlic lovers!The dish consists of shrimp covered in an unholy amount of garlic with hints of paprika and sherry. It’s another one that’s so popular you’ll likely find it in every restaurant in the country.Patatas BravasPatatas Bravas, aka patatas a la brava or papas bravas, is a dish that consists of white potatoes that have been cut into cubes, fried, and covered in a spicy tomato sauce. Think of them as Spain’s version of a french fry!Is your mouth watering yet?Croquetas (de Jamon)These can only be described as fried balls of goodness.Okay, okay, so they’re really fried béchamel fritters with Spanish cured ham…but I just like to call them fried balls of goodness. Feel like it’s fitting! I mean who doesn’t like small fried food?You’ll find Croquetas de Jamon on the menu at most bars in Spain.GildaGilda literally means lollipop in Spanish...but these aren’t your typical sweet dessert. Oh no!They’re salty and savory skewers made of guindilla peppers, white anchovies, and green olives, all served on a toothpick.Pulpo a la GallegaThis traditional dish from the Galicia region is for adventurous eaters...because it’s made of boiled octopus seasoned with salt, smoked paprika, and a healthy drizzle of olive oil!Pulpo a la Gallega is typically served on a wooden plate with sliced potatoes. The key is to find a spot that cooks the octopus perfectly (or else it ends up rubbery).Note: This is sometimes seen as polbo á feira.Queso con MembrilloThis is typically served as a dessert tapa...though you can find it served at breakfast from time to time.“Membrillo” is a sweet, very dense jelly or paste made from the fruit of a quince tree. Paired with cheese, it’s a great option for those that want a dish that satisfies both the salty and sweet cravings.Note: Sometimes you will see it listed as queso manchego con membrillo (‘manchego’ being the name of the cheese).Albondigas en SalsaAlbondigas en salsa, aka “meatballs in sauce,” is a Spanish take on the Italian dish. The meatballs are prepared in a garlic tomato sauce and served with bread or patatas bravas. And yes, it would be difficult to not scarf down the whole thing!Next trip to Spain your tastebuds are going to dance in delight!

https://theblondeabroad.com/day-trip-to-cadiz-from-seville/,Day Trip to Cádiz from Seville,Spain,"This post was written by Sivan, our Student Travel Expert!Cádiz is a well-known beach town in Southern Spain. It’s a small city, but it is a big hub for cruise ships and other travelers. If you’re looking for a little getaway from Seville…here are some ideas for a day trip to Cádiz from Seville!Getting to CádizThere are trains that run to and from Cádiz all day from different cities. I traveled there from Seville, and my train ride took about two hours.If you’re traveling from farther away, the train between Barcelona and Cádiz takes about seven and a half hours, while the train from Madrid takes about four hours. You can also fly into the Jerez Airport which is just about thirty minutes outside of Cádiz.What to Do in CádizTavira Tower: This is the highest point in old-town Cádiz, and it has the best 360-degree view of the city. You can head up to the top for six euros per person, and for a bit extra, you can stick around to see images from the Camera Obscura. The Camera Obsucra projects real-time images from outside the tower on a screen in a dark room inside the tower. The attendants will let you know what time the next show starts so you can grab a seat.Mercado Central: In every city, I travel to, I love to find the biggest local market with the best vendors. Mercado Central is full of booths with local produce, including pork, cheese, fruit, and sweets. You can also nibble on some hot dishes and sip on a beer at one of the tables in the center.Parque Genoves: This beautiful park is perfect for a stroll or a picnic getaway from the city. Be sure to check out the botanical gardens, the cave, the lake, and the waterfall that are inside. Also, keep your eyes open for all the species of birds!Cádiz Cathedral: When you walk through the city, you can’t miss this iconic cathedral with its golden dome rooftop and beautiful architecture. Check out the inside of the cathedral for five euros or with a guided tour. You can also climb up the tower for another great view of the city.The Beach: Cádiz has many beaches. They are all a bit different, but each one is an equally great choice for a relaxing few hours on the sand. The beaches there have won multiple awards for being the best in Europe.La Caleta Beach: Located between two old castles, this is known as one of the most beautiful beaches in Cádiz.Santa Maria Del Mar Beach: This is a great beach for families and bodyboarding.La Victoria Beach: This is one of the most popular beaches (especially with the locals). It’s the closest one to shops, restaurants, and hotels.Where to Eat in CádizCádiz is a pretty small city, and if you choose to skip visiting the beach, you can finish up most of the best activities in a short amount of time. To fill the rest of my time in the city, I decided to design my own food tour.The traditional way to eat in Spain is to order tapas, which are small plates of food. Instead of ordering lots of tapas in one place, I ordered one or two plates in a bunch of different restaurants. Each of these places is within walking distance in the city. (And the walks make the perfect break in between all the indulgence!)Casa Manteca: Start at this famous bar known for its traditional Spanish decor and very close quarters. You may have to elbow your way through to order, but it’s worth being a part of the bustling atmosphere. Order yourself a tinto de verano (the traditional drink of Southern Spain), and nibble on the classic tapa of cheese and ham.Sopranis: Head to this trendy restaurant for a sit-down glass of wine and a diverse range of dishes. I had the salmon tartar with avocado, and it was delicious! Sitting outside on the side street is the perfect set up for people watching.La Candela: You might have to look up from your Google Maps to find this hole-in-the-wall restaurant. When you do find it, you will walk into Spain’s version of boho-chic. The farm-to-table Spanish menu highlights the fresh ingredients in Cádiz. Start with the cheese board where you get to choose from a selection (I recommend trying the truffle Gouda) and grab one more small item off the menu.Balandro: When you see the ocean, you have found Balandro. This restaurant is known for its beautiful view and its fresh seafood. You can’t go wrong with any of the fish dishes or seafood pasta.Dessert: A food tour is never over until you have had dessert! Cádiz is known for traditional little cookies, and there are bakeries all over the city. When you’re wandering around, pop into a bake shop to grab yourself a mix of almond cookies, chocolate-dipped shortbread, and jelly-filled pastries.Cádiz shows off the best of the southern Spanish culture from the food to the religious history. Whether you are relaxing on the beach or touring the city, Cádiz makes for the perfect day trip from anywhere in Southern Spain! Do you have any tips for Seville? Let me know in the comments!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-spains-lesser-known-destinations/,Exploring Spain’s Lesser-Known Destinations,Spain,"Spain will always hold a special place in my heart. It was the destination of my first international trip, and where I studied Spanish abroad and started to discover how much excitement the world had to offer.My favorite part of that first trip was able to explore smaller cities and towns in Spain that I wouldn’t have known about prior, and that are somewhat off the tourist path. I spent a month in Spain that summer, living in Salamanca and El Puerto de Santa Maria, and exploring the surrounding regions.Here are some of Spain’s lesser-known destinations!Castile and León RegionSegoviaFrom Madrid, you can get to the city of Segovia in less than thirty minutes on the high-speed train, and I recommend getting out there. Famous for its Alcázar and Roman aqueduct, Segovia is a gorgeous UNESCO World Heritage Site.One thing that I found interesting about Segovia is that it’s said that Walt Disney drew inspiration from the majestic Alcázar for the iconic Cinderella’s castle.Helpful Tip: You can buy train tickets online with your Mastercard credit card on the Renfe website. You have the options to grab a Renfe Spain pass to explore the entire country or to get roundtrip tickets as you need them; both can be good options depending on your plans.ÁvilaIf you’re planning to visit Madrid, don’t miss Ávila. You can travel between the cities in less than two hours by Renfe train, and it’s well worth the trip.Ávila is a World Heritage monument, one of the oldest cities in Spain and considered a “City of Three Cultures” (Jewish, Islamic and Christian). Most notably, it’s the birthplace of Santa Teresa and a stop along the Camino de la Lengua, a historical route that hits various places that influenced the development of Spanish culture and language.SalamancaThe north of Spain is completely underrated. While the south is gorgeous, the north has a unique look and feel that you have to see.When I studied abroad in 2008, I spent my first two weeks in the city of Salamanca and absolutely loved it. It’s a fun college town with a remarkable history, and the people are among the friendliest you’ll ever meet.Read More: A Photo Tour of Salamanca, SpainAsturias RegionCovadongaA mountainous region on the northern coast of Spain, Asturias is unlike anywhere else in Spain. The locals take immense pride in the fact that they have always been Spanish. Asturias is the only part of Spain that was never conquered by the Moors, so on top of being stunning, the region is distinct in several ways.The village of Covadonga in Asturias is an absolute must-see. It’s a historically significant spot where the Reconquista of Spain began. It’s also home to one of the very few Spanish lakes and the picturesque San Fernando Collegiate Church.Helpful Tip: Like in most villages, there are some small cash-only businesses around Asturias. Use your Mastercard to withdraw cash at the start of your adventure, so you’re covered.Extremadura RegionMéridaOnce a far-flung Roman capital, Mérida is home to 60,000 residents, incredible ruins, and an amazing Roman Theater that’s still in use. Halfway between Madrid and Seville, near the Portuguese border, this city is too often overlooked.While you may have never heard of it, Mérida is one of the most beautiful spots in Spain, and you’ll find tons to do there.CáceresThe quaint city of Cáceres is just an hour from Mérida. Stroll the cobblestone streets, and take in the incredible architecture while learning about the city’s rich history. As an added perk, you can save some serious euros here. Cáceres has the lowest cost of living in all of Spain, and you’ll find bargains all over the city.Helpful Tip: Cáceres has a lot of smaller shops and restaurants alongside chains, so it’s handy to have cash!Andalusia RegionCórdobaYou can’t visit Spain without checking out the Andalusia region. Córdoba is a lesser-known town in the area, but having played an important role in both the Roman Empire and the Moorish period, this place has a fascinating history and breathing-taking sites.For me, the highlight of Córdoba is la Mezquita (Catedral de Córdoba), one of the largest and most symbolic Islamic buildings in the world. It was built in the Umayyad dynasty when Islam reigned over Spain but then was converted into a cathedral after the Reconquista or the Spanish Conquest by the Christians.MálagaThe second largest city in the Andalusia region, Málaga is an ideal hub for travelers. The town is over 2,800 years old, making it one of the oldest cities in the world– it is rapidly developing, but has maintained its picturesque charm. The Castle of Gibralfaro, which is connected to the Alcazaba, is one of the main historical sights.The art and cultural scene is on the rise and is being compared to Madrid in that sense.You’ll find lots of fine dining has rapidly emerged as the province’s city of culture with its so-called ‘mile of art’ being compared to Madrid, and its dynamism and fine dining to Barcelona.Discount airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet fly into Málaga, so you can city hop on the cheap. Europe is full of discount airlines, and they’re perfect for short trips. The rates are ultra-competitive, and they are totally no-frills.Helpful Tip: I recommend using a Mastercard credit card that offers travel miles. Even if you don’t travel a ton, the points build up quickly. I especially love it because it means that I don’t have to be loyal to any particular airline, and can go with the most affordable option on a trip-by-trip basis. Especially in Europe, you can save a lot of cash by booking with the discount airlines, and those airlines rarely offer miles or points.GranadaIf I had to make a top-ten list of Europe’s best sites, the Alhambra of Granada would absolutely make the cut. Overlooking the city, this fortress is one of Spain’s most popular destinations.When visiting Granada, the Alhambra is an absolute must visit, but because of its popularity, you need to book early. But, Andalusia is also the birthplace of Flamenco, so I’d highly recommend planning to see a show while you’re there. Avoid a group tour, and find a private Flamenco club.Helpful Tip: Before you head to Granada, get online.

https://theblondeabroad.com/beginners-guide-running-of-the-bulls/,The Beginner’s Guide to The Running of the Bulls,Spain,"The Running of the Bulls, or Encierro, takes place on the morning of the second day of the San Fermín festival. After a long and eventful first day commencing the festival, including the opening ceremonies, the Running of the Bulls comes in a flash.Here’s my beginner’s guide to The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain! The San Fermín FestivalThe San Fermín Festival takes place in Pamplona, Spain every year. You may have never heard of the actual festival but it’s internationally recognized for the famous ‘Running of the Bulls’. It attracts millions of visitors for nine days of festivities and is crowned as Spain’s largest festival!The opening ceremony, or “Chupinazo,” of the festival takes place in Plaza Consistorial outside of City Hall on the first day. Thousands of people pack themselves into every crevice of the Spanish city to celebrate the commencement of the festival.The festival officially begins on the first day at noon, it will commence with a firecracker, and everyone absolutely loses it and goes bananas in celebration!Each night at 11 p.m. during the San Fermín festival, there are firework displays that shame any show I have ever seen. The entire sky is lit up (for almost 30 minutes) with colorful sparks of fire above the ancient Citadel of Pamplona.The party continues on through the night with high anticipation for the Running of the Bulls the next morning.The TraditionSo why does this festival exist and what does it mean for the Spanish people?The tradition dates back to the 13th century and the origins of the annual bull runs are actually based on practicality…and not any sort of festival!Cattle herders who were transporting their animals from the countryside to the city to sell them needed a way to move their animals.A tradition grew out of this—a narrow path would be cleared in the city center where the spirited animals could run and be corraled together. With the encouragement from bystanders and people shouting from buildings, the herders were able to speed up the process.Nobody knows for sure when the exact date was, but it started to become a competition for young men to rush alongside the animals and it became a test of bravado.It’s believed that the San Fermín Festival and the Running of the Bulls naturally merged together over time. The Festival is associated with the city’s co-patron saint, and given the dangers involved, many revelers and participants ask Saint Fermín for guidance and protection.UpdateI attended this festival a number of years ago. While I’m glad I got to experience it and I think it’s important to highlight cultural practices and traditions around the world, it’s not something I support. It’s something I look back on now that I’m older and wouldn’t go to again.However, one of the goals with The Blonde Abroad is to highlight other cultures, as different as they may be from our own, rather than gloss over things. I think this is the best way to open up a dialogue about the world around us and in turn, promote positive growth.The Running of the BullsThe Running of the Bulls takes place on the second day of the festival, and many people party through the previous night and come for the run still stained in sangria. The streets are cleaned as best as possible while thousands of people begin to fill the streets and balconies along the route of the run.You will want to get to the main street where the running takes place early, about 7 a.m. to be safe. You’ll have to enter through the gateway at the Town Hall before 7:30 a.m. as the running begins at 8 a.m. promptly.  Once the run gets closer to beginning, the police will start separating the crowd and clearing the route.It’ll get cozy, but there will be lots of cheering and songs to pass the time!About 15 minutes before the start, the police will start to let the runners take their places and at 8:00 a.m. you’ll hear a loud shotgun! That signifies that the gates holding the bulls has been opened, and a couple minutes later you’ll hear the second shotgun, which means that all the bulls are on the streets and running.The whole Running with the Bulls event only lasts about four to five minutes, but believe me, the adrenaline will last for hours!What to ExpectAccommodation: The prices for everything in town during this week, especially the room rates, are massively inflated and every place is booked.Weather: Pamplona in July is sunny and warm! Expect temperatures in the low 80° F (26° C).Traditions: Traditionally, women do not run the race. If you’re concerned for your safety, a bird’s eye view is more than satisfactory for a first experience!Partying: Get ready for nonstop partying from (even before) the opening ceremonies for the following nine days. Sangria galore!The RulesBelieve it or not, there are actual rules for participating in the Running of the Bulls, and for great reason. The rules are published by the City of Pamplona and are strongly enforced each morning along the bull run route.If you are found violating these rules, you can be ejected from the bull run, detained, or arrested, depending on the severity of your infraction.  The purpose of these rules is to protect yourselves and others from increased risk of injury in an already dangerous situation!Here are a few key rules:The presence on the route of minors under the age of 18, who are absolutely excluded from the right to run or take part.Before the bulls are released, waiting in corners, blind spots, doorways or premises located along the route.Keeping doors of shops or doorways of houses along the route open, with the owners or tenants of the premises concerned being responsible for ensuring this.Remaining on the route in a state of drunkenness, under the effect of drugs or engaging in any other improper behavior.Carrying objects deemed unsuitable for the smooth running of the encierro (including any type of camera or video camera).Running towards the bulls or running behind them.Be sure to read all of the rules before attending to keep yourself and others safe!How to Dress for Running of the BullsTraditionally, you should expect to dress in all white and bring a red handkerchief, or “Pañuelo,” to tie around your neck at the sound of a firecracker at noon.You can find the all-white outfits around town and it will cost you about $20 to buy the whole thing, so that is probably the best option, especially if you’re trying to travel light!You can go out first thing in the morning (or continue on from last night’s party) dressed from head to toe in white and fit in perfectly.A note to the wise, expect to end up covered in water, sangria, mustard, soda, eggs…you name it! My ExperienceThe whole event seems surreal in hindsight but I’m so glad I went. I got the opportunity to be a part of a cultural experience that has been passed on for hundreds of years.While the chaos of the small streets filled with thousands of (mostly drunk) people can be overwhelming, I only stayed for the first two days. I got a taste for the San Fermín Festival and was able to leave without feeling like it was too much of a good thing.READ NEXT: San Fermín Festival: Opening Ceremony & The Running of the Bulls Read MoreThe Best Time to Go to SpainTop Destinations in Spain For Female TravelersWhere to Find the Best Food in MadridThe Ultimate Madrid Travel GuideVIDEO: The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona /* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1466624193647?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */ "

I did a study abroad program there years ago and it was one of the best experiences of my life. I fell in love with traveling then, and my wanderlust hasn’t faded one bit.With endless festivals, world-class beaches, and a renowned nightlife, Spain is amazing 365 days a year.I could spend years exploring Spain. From Salamanca to Barcelona to Cádiz to Bilbao, it’s such a vibrant country.

From rocky cliffs to golden sands, you could spend a lifetime exploring all of the stunning shorelines of Spain. The picture-perfect beaches of Andalucía are some of the most gorgeous spots on the planet.Costa del Sol and Costa de la Luz are perfect for every kind of traveler. You can find crazy nightlife, family-friendly resorts, quiet beaches, and everything else you could ever ask for.Go kiteboarding, windsurfing, or bask in the sun with a glass of sangria in hand.

Days of festivals, celebrations, and of course, bulls!A word to the wise, don’t go crazy planning trips to tourist traps. Summers in Spain can be scorching and incredibly crowded. Visit the museums, galleries, and historical points you are dying to see but don’t waste hours in line for things you could live without.Highlights: San Fermín Festival, Beaches, and Beautiful WeatherAutumn in SpainMonths: September to NovemberEasily one of the best times of the year, autumn has lovely weather and beautiful sights. Go see the changing fall colors and 500-year-old trees in Faedo de Ciñera. Visit the Chestnut Festival at the end of October then go foraging for wild mushrooms with the locals.Beginning in early September, it is time to taste test the year’s wine harvest. You can visit the bodegas of the Rioja and Ribera for some of the most amazing wine you’ll ever have. It’s definitely a trip that should be on any wine lover’s bucket list.Highlights: Seasonal Wines & Cuisine Winter in SpainMonths: December to FebruaryPrices are low, tourists are leaving, and the weather is still pretty great. With average winter high temperature nearing 70 degrees Fahrenheit in many parts of the country, the weather is ideal for exploring.

They have great ski resorts and some awesome slopes. Once you work up an appetite, you’re in for a treat. Winter is one of the best times to go on epicurean tours and take cooking classes.According to Anthony Bourdain, Spain is the single greatest place for culinary achievement in the world (outside of Asia). I agree wholeheartedly and so will you when you taste your way through Spain and hit all of its culinary treasures.Highlights: Mild Weather, Ski Resorts & Epicurean Experiences Spring in SpainMonths: March to MayYou’ll fall head over heels for Spain when you see how absolutely spectacular the country is during the spring.

Be sure to check the festival schedule before you go. There is a dizzying array of celebrations all over the country that you won’t want to miss.Some of my favorites are Valencia’s Las Fallas sculpture burning festival, which is packed with stunning parades. One of the biggest celebrations of the year is Semana Santa. This is the holy week leading up to Easter. There are celebrations all over the country with Andalucía and Toledo among the top picks.Highlights: Outdoor Activities & Festivals"
https://theblondeabroad.com/find-best-food-madrid/,Where to Find the Best Food in Madrid,Spain,"The following statement might sound somewhat counterintuitive, but it’s something I’ve learned to be true.  Part of the lure, or maybe the advantage, that comes with being an avid traveler is actually the freedom you begin to feel that you’ve earned the right to start repeating places in which you are visiting.  Sure, I still constantly feel the urge to keep racking up my country count.  With every number it goes up I continue to have a major sense of pride and excitement.  I love going to new places, and that is never going to change.  On the flipside, going somewhere that you’ve already been does have several positives, and there can definitely be something kind of nice about it.  For one, pressure’s off.  Chances are on your first go-around you hit all the “it would be embarrassing to admit you visited ___ and didn’t see ___” spots, and now you don’t have to.  That leaves more time to explore like a local, avoiding the big hitting ticket items that can often take up time you might not necessarily have to give.  Second, having been there before you likely already have your bearings and some sense of what your destination is all about.  It tends to take at least a couple of days to really start to “get” what a new place, but since you’ve been before you don’t have to worry about that.  Now you can dive right in, and go even deeper.  I went to Madrid for the third time recently, and was really excited to do so.  I didn’t plan a ton in advance, I wandered around for hours on end, and I focused on what’s truly most important when traveling- eating.Here are some of the standout, best places for food in Madrid!Sala de DespieceSala de Despiece is located on the now gastronomically bustling Calle de Ponzano in the quaint but interesting Chamberi section of Madrid.  The name, which translates to Cutting Room, is exactly that.  The space is small and narrow and set up to prepare your mostly uncooked food in a somewhat live setting, pulling out blowtorches when needed and calling your name to grab a wax paper lined metal tray when your order is up.  Sala De Despiece has a casual air to it but is one of the most precise and professional culinary experiences I’ve ever had, and was my favorite of the visit.  The DIY tuna tartare, redder than red tomatoes, insane mouthwatering burrata and dulce de leche dessert were all next level.  Olivia te CuidaThis is the most lovely dinner party there ever was brought to you personally, courtesy of sisters Esther and Marian Campoy.  Step into Olivia te Cuida (“Olivia takes care of you”) and settle into a afternoon of comfort and coziness, with two dozen options worth of vegetables, salads and grains that will rock your taste buds and jolt you right into the life of a relaxed and happy Spaniard.Ten con TenIf you want to experience the see and be seen side of Madrid, and are looking for a dinner that feels larger and grander than the rest, head straight to Ten con Ten.  There is a distinguished, animated, cosmopolitan atmosphere here, where you’ll feel like you’ve truly stepped into the not so hidden world of upscale Madrilenos.  The food, though style wise might not have been my favorite of the trip, was undeniably top notch and mostly very impressive.  Afterwards roll straight into an evening of gin and tonics, fine wines and cigars, if that’s your fancy; you certainly won’t be alone.  Mercado de San IldefonsoDropping by the rooftop of Mercado de San Ildefonso was a fun local twist in the midst of a busy night out.  Stomachs full of the excessively popular g&t’s, this time from Macera cocktail bar, a quick stop here at midnight was exactly what we needed.  My plate of choice was straight up pulpo; so simple, so good. Federal Cafe MadridYes, this place is Australian, yes, they have avocado toast there, and yes, even though I was in Spain, I ordered it. Every state/country/continent, whatever, seems to have an extra ingredient to make avocado toast “theirs.” Federal adds a creamy feta and drops it all atop their delicious grainy bread- can’t say no to that, can I?  Juana La LocaThis was the surprise hit of the week.  Determined to spend a Sunday afternoon as traditional Madrilenos do, we headed straight for La Latina, a vibrant and captivating area swarming with smiling young people with tapas on their plates and cold beers in their hands.  We opted to duck into Juana La Loca in hopes of an elevated tapas experience, rather than the great, albeit more simple one that was happening in the half dozen plazas around us.  What was found was one of the best dishes either one of us have ever had, anywhere.  The off the menu thickly sliced sea bass carpaccio with scallions, pepper and truffle oil was beyond normal human comprehension; this was one for the books, and one I will absolutely not soon forget.TricicloTriciclo was the closing meal to a couple of days of eating that were truly impressive, and it did not at all disappoint.  As soon as I walked in I knew I liked it.  The decor was charming with a huge attention to detail; lemons, flowers, gorgeous plates, beautiful tables and remnants of its trademark tricycle scattered thoughtfully about.  The food was excellent, ranging from a distinctive twist on gazpacho, a ceviche packed full of flavor to an interesting pea, seaweed and monkfish dish.  I’d go back here again in a heartbeat. Read More: 10 Amazing Tapas to Order in Spain"

https://theblondeabroad.com/world-cup-for-kiteboarding/,The World Cup for Kiteboarding,Spain,"While visiting the gorgeous island of Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands I was lucky enough to go to the 2012 World Cup for Kiteboarding and Windsurfing.  The competition was being hosted in Fuerteventura and would last for a few days. The final days of the competition were scheduled as freestyle and Air Style Shows.  I figured it would be a great opportunity to make the long bus journey to the south of the island to check it out!After a 3 hour bus ride I finally made it to the René Egli Center for the competition. To be honest, I had no idea what I was in store for. As I walked from the bus stop down to the beach I could make out the layout of the competition. A grand stand was set up right along the water and people of all ages packed in eagerly anticipating the first round of the Air Style Show.The competition began with a Women’s Air Style heat. These girls rocked! I was in awe as they launched into the sky whipping around and throwing tricks that I couldn’t even pronounce (or at least translate from Spanish). The day proceeded with a Men’s heat, followed by another Women’s heat, and back and forth until only two girls and two guys were left as finalists in the competition.As the last heat for men was finished everyone made their way inside a giant tent area where the winners were announced. The finalists celebrated in a champagne shower and were granted the title of World Champion Kitesurfers!

The streets are cleaned as best as possible while thousands of people begin to fill the streets and balconies along the route of the run.I got an early start at 6:30 am on the morning of July 7th to get to our balcony on Estafeta Street (the longest stretch along the route of the run). Three of my guy friends were going to be running but I decided against it. Traditionally, women do not run the race. For my own safety, and out of respect for the culture, I decided that a bird’s eye view would be more than satisfactory.The anticipation leading to the race at 8 am was incredible. I was so nervous! I only had stories that I had heard to fuel my expectations and, quite literally, anything could happen. Nobody has died in many years but the possibility of injury is highly likely. People fall, get pushed and can be gored by the bulls. I couldn’t even imagine what the runners were feeling as they stood down below waiting for the sound of the firecracker.The sound of a shot rang through the air and we watched from the balconies waiting for the massive animals to come charging around the corner. Thousands of people began to run and soon I noticed the beginning of a group literally running for their lives. The bulls were just beyond them.A group of 6 bulls came charging around the corner surrounded by people either avoiding the bulls or attempting to run alongside them close enough to touch their horns.My stomach was in knots as the wave of red, white and bull sped through the street below.It was over in seconds as the crowd continued on towards the final destination, the Plaza de Toros. After the bulls passed, we turned to the television for news to see if anything was reported. Luckily, everything went smoothly and there were no tragedies. The festival would continue for 8 days including 7 more Running of the Bulls, 7 more fireworks shows and countless other celebrations.The whole event seems surreal in hindsight but I’m so glad I went.

You may have never heard of the actual festival but it’s internationally recognized for the famous Running of the Bulls. It has been a dream of mine to participate in the festivities and I finally got to turn that dream into reality!Clever marketing!The opening ceremony, or “Chupinazo,” of the first day of the festival takes place in Plaza Consistorial outside of City Hall. Thousands of people pack themselves into every crevice of the Spanish city to celebrate the commencement of the festival.Traditionally, you should expect to dress in all white and bring a red handkerchief, or “Pañuelo,” to tie around your neck at the sound of a firecracker at noon.The madness of the opening ceremonyWhile the festival officially begins on the first day at noon, the party begins well before that. You go out first thing in the morning (or continue on from last night’s party) dressed from head to toe in white.Expect to be covered in water, sangria, mustard, soda, eggs… you name it!I was above the chaos on a balcony during the ceremony with people below shouting for me to pour water/sangria down onto them. Ask and you shall receive!Someone is about to get wet!After the sounding of the firecracker at noon, everyone absolutely loses it and goes bananas in celebration! The madness doesn’t subside for hours either. The streets remain full of people drinking and partying ALL day. So, to stick with “tradition,” I divulged in a classy box of red wine and took to the streets.It does the trick!Later in the evening, I went to the first bullfight of the festival. I won’t go into too much detail about the whole experience but it was a different style bullfight where the men actually fought the bulls on horseback. The horses were stunning and SO well trained. They would dance around the bull fearlessly and with incredible grace and agility. I am glad I went but I know that I’ll never go again.More on that in another post.The first bullfight of San FerminEach night at 11pm, during the San Fermin festival, there are firework displays that shame any show I have ever seen. The entire sky is lit up (for almost 30 minutes) with colorful sparks of fire above the ancient Citadel of Pamplona. The party continues on through the night with high anticipation for the Running of the Bulls the next morning.So beautiful!Check out my post on Day 2 and the Running of the Bulls!"

After tracing my roots to France, I’ve been looking to build a deeper connection with the country…And what better way than digging into some of the best plates on the planet?When it comes to France, and particularly eating like a local whilst touring the country, what should you know before you go to get a deeper appreciation for the culture and enhance your experience? I’m dishing up the goods!Here is your ultimate guide to eating like a local in France. Bon appétit!  Best Food in Paris Read More!About the MealsBreakfastThe French typically start their day with a pastry and a coffee. Quick picks like pain au chocolat or croissants are popular. Most locals pair it with a milky café au lait. While Starbucks and other chains are cropping up, the coffee options you find in most local cafes and eateries are very basic; think coffee beans, milk, sugar.So simple yet decadent!Coffee is usually cheaper at the bar than drinking at a table—there’s actually a sidewalk tax for using the coveted French footpath space!LunchParisians have famous long lunches that can easily span over two hours. Even if it is a simple and light lunch, it won’t be quick! You will find many French people who can spend 45 minutes with a baguette sandwich.Meals are a very social affair and you won’t see many people rushing through the streets alone with fast food. The French mentality is that you work to live, not live to work. If you need a break from work, you take it.That’s not to say that the French don’t get their jobs done! They often work later than Americans since they have long lunches. It is not unusual to finish work at 7 pm.DinnerAfter work, it is usually a two-course affair or more. While these might seem like big meals, it is important to know that snacking isn’t the norm. It is common for kids but many adults stick exclusively to standard meal times.Bread is often served with dinner—but not as an appetizer. It is meant for dipping and cleaning your plate! While there are a lot of amazing French desserts, cheese is a common post-meal treat.Helpful Tip:On your first trip to France? You need my 10 key tips for those that want to feel like locals!   Eating ScheduleEven during the weekend, breakfast is a quick meal. You might see people lounging at sidewalk cafes with croissants and coffee but they won’t be sitting down to huge breakfast. Brunch is becoming a trendy thing but it’s not necessarily the norm.In France, you might be surprised to see that restaurants are not open all day. Lunch service will usually go from 12 to 2:30 pm. It’s common to then close and open up again for dinner service from 7-11 pm, or so.If you are hungry between the normal service times, you can always pop in a patisserie or boulangerie. French lesson of the day: You might translate both of these words to ‘bakery’ but a patisserie is for pastries while a boulangerie is for bread.While I usually love a bakery run, if you aren’t in the mood for carbs, you will find groceries stores with other options like pre-made salads.  MarseilleEtiquetteWhile many places recommend reservations, I’ve generally been able to get a table quickly in most places around France. Unless it’s a weekend dinner at a popular spot, it’s usually just a short wait. That said, book a table to be on the safe side if you’re really excited to go somewhere.Like most of Europe, you will see French people eating with their fork in the left hand and the knife in the right. They pile food onto the back of the fork using the knife.  Tipping + the BillThe staff at the restaurants make a full wage and tipping them is not expected by any means! If the service is great, of course, you are welcome to leave more. If the bill is 27 euros, you might leave 30. It is never expected though and across Europe tipping is seen as something of an American tourist tax!You will always have to ask for the bill, the staff will never bring it to you or try to rush you out.When you are ready, try saying, “l’addition s’il vous plaît” (if you’re a newbie, listen to this to help with pronunciation). It is common for restaurants to bring a card machine to your table to process the bill. If you don’t have a chip-and-PIN card, you may run into issues paying so it’s smart to keep some cash on hand.How Meat is PreparedIf you are shy about rare meat, keep in mind that French preparation methods keep meat pretty darn bloody compared to the US. What Americans would call rare, is more like medium rare in France. The most common American preparation—medium rare—is called “a point” in French. Here are a few words you might see:Want to try a nice French steak?It’s essential to know how meat is cooked!Bleu: Almost uncooked Saignante: Rare A Point: Medium rare Bien Cuit: Medium wellIf you love your meat well-done, wait until you get home!Quintessential French Meals  to  TrySteak Frites: plain and simple, it’s steak and fries. And oftentimes it’s dressed with the tastiest sauce…ever!Croque Monsieur: This is basically grilled cheese and another quick comfort meal option. You will often find ham in these along with gruyère cheese.Steak Tartare: You might be shocked to see how common fresh meat is around France. It is properly prepared, however, and generally considered safe. Of course, trust your gut! If you are sensitive or it just doesn’t look right, skip it!Quiche Lorraine: This one is a bit less shocking to a non-French palette! This tasty omelette style dish is made with eggs, cream, cheese, and usually bacon.  Sault, FranceOn CustomizationIn France, almost all people order directly from the menu without special requests. Chefs put a lot of thought and effort into dishes and will not be thrilled that you think you know better.The idea that “the customer is always right” is very much an American thing. When it comes to food, the French believe it’s best to leave it to the pros. You are better off, however, to find a place that has a menu you like.If you have allergies or other dietary restrictions, you are very welcome to ask, of course.    Shopping for ProduceIn France, especially in small towns, it’s all about specialty shops. There are special stores for wine, cheese, meat, bread, and anything else you might eat.If you know a few words of French or are lucky enough to stumble onto an English speaking spot, ask for recommendations from the clerk. They aren’t just randomly working at this shop. They tend to be very knowledgeable and are happy to help!No Food on the GoYou won’t find many French places offering food on the go. You will find some foreign fast-food spots where you can get something quickly if you’re in need—it’s okay in a pinch but it’s definitely not a part of local’s daily diet. That said, MacDo (aka McDonald’s) is pretty popular with Parisian youth!If you want something easy and quick, stop by any food shop for a bit of bread and cheese for an instant French picnic (which I am obsessed with!).  48 Hours in Marseille Read More!OverallI know that French people can get a bad rap for people being rude, but I’ve had nothing but good experiences.Even if you don’t speak French, saying bonjour when you see someone for the first time and throwing in a merci (thank you), excusez-moi (excuse me), and s’il vous plaît (please) where you can will go a long way.Ready to eat your way from Normandy to Nice?

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-celebrate-bastille-day-in-france/,How to Celebrate Bastille Day in France,France,"Last year I researched my ancestry and traced familial roots to France—this led me on a whirlwind tour of the gorgeous country and you bet, I fell head over heels for its charm. France has always held a special place in my heart, but now more than ever! To truly channel my French roots, I’ve got to get down with Bastille Day, right?In France, Bastille Day is a big deal—though it’s really only referred to as Bastille Day outside of France!Called la Fête nationale (or sometimes just le 14 juillet) in France, the holiday commemorates the Storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. It’s a public holiday and most places close up shop for the day.What does the day commemorate?This was the flashpoint of the French Revolution, which ultimately transformed the country and European culture as a whole. Nowadays, the entire country comes together to celebrate the end of the French monarchy.If you are lucky enough to be there on the big day, here is everything you need to know about how to celebrate Bastille Day in France! Champs-Élysées Military ParadeAvenue des Champs-Élysées is one of the most beautiful places in Paris at any time of the year, and it truly comes alive on Bastille Day.

Paris puts on a huge free concert at Champ de Mars in front of the Eiffel Tower and fireworks start at 11 pm.They light up the Eiffel Tower for yet another picture-perfect scene.Versailles is a prime place to be on Bastille Day. Beginning at 9 pm, there is a fireman’s dance followed by an incredible show. Just note that this year there won’t be fireworks directly in front of the palace as there were in the past.Instead, there will be a display at the Versailles Orangerie. Inspired by the lavish soirees Louis XIV used to put on, Versailles gives a fascinating look back at French history and culture. Fireman’s BallsI know, I know, the English translation is pretty cheeky…in French, these celebrations are known as Bals des Pompiers.In addition to fireworks, the fireman’s balls are a common tradition! Cities throughout France celebrate Bastille Day by opening up fire stations for visitors. The tradition dates back to 1937 when a group of firemen opened their doors for curious locals.They put on a show and the tradition continues each year as fire departments display their gymnastic prowess and set off small fireworks. Keep It Simple à la FrançaiseRather than fighting the crowds, many French people opt for a low-key celebration. They enjoy their extra day off work by getting together with friends and family at a BBQ or picnic (here’s why I am always ready for a French picnic).Want to blend in with the locals? Get in the revolutionary spirit by belting out the French national anthem with the help of this handy phonetic guide. Outside of ParisLyonThere is no better time to visit Lyon.

Home to gourmet food, haute couture, opulent landmarks, and beautiful countrysides, it’s not hard to why it’s one of the most visited countries in the world.While France is the size of Texas, it has something to offer every kind of traveler. But before you book your flights and start brushing up on your French, there are few things you need to know.Here are 10 tips for your first trip to France!   The French Aren’t RudeThere is a stereotype that the French are extremely rude and dislike tourists. I even found myself bracing for this before I visited for the first time.I’m happy to report that I found the French to be very kind!I don’t speak any French beyond the basics, but a smile went a long way with the locals. Having something like a picture of a landmark also helped me get my point across and overcome the language barrier.   Lavender Fields in ProvenceEnglish is Not Widely SpokenUnlike some other travel destinations in Europe, the French speak very little English. They are very proud to speak French which is understandable.Imagine if tourists who came to your country expected you to be fluent in their native tongue. Before you arrive in France, come prepared with a few French phrases under your belt!    Learn About French Wine and FoodYou’ll want to familiarize yourself with the French food and wine culture before you arrive. It will make ordering food easier, and it will give you an idea of what you want to eat.Some things don’t translate too literally, and it might leave you wondering what the heck is on the menu.If you have any allergies, knowing what menu items are will make your life much easier as well. You should learn to explain what your allergies are in French, so there’s no miscommunication with your waiter.Read More: The Ultimate France Travel Guide  Take the TrainFrance has an incredible transportation system, especially the trains. I traveled solo through France by train in the summer of 2018 and had an incredible experience!The trains are easy to use and affordable. I got to explore many of the smaller villages and towns in France like St. Emilion, Marseille, Roussillon and Bordeaux!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Traveling By Train in France    France is HugeWhen most people think of France, they think of only Paris. But the country has so much more to offer beyond its capital city!I highly recommend visiting the French countryside and exploring the Provence and Cote d’Azur regions! You’ll experience a different side of the country and get an authentic taste of French culture.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Provence   The LouvreThe French ScheduleThe French work on a different schedule than what you’re probably used to back home. For example, in small towns and villages all shops, banks, and businesses close for 2 hours for lunch.In remote areas, the break can last from  1 PM to 4 PM, and it’s similar to the Italian siesta! Keep the schedule in mind when planning your itinerary, so you don’t accidentally visit a shop or restaurant at the wrong time.    Car RentalIf you have room in your budget, I recommend renting a car while you’re in France. It’s a great way to explore France’s lesser-known destinations and to give yourself more control over your itinerary.Here are some things to keep in mind when driving in France:Manual transmission cars are cheaper and will give you better mileageThere are speed cameras everywhere, and fines are expensiveWhen filling up with gas, remember that “essence” is gasoline and “gasoil” is dieselRead More: Essential Tips for Driving in Provence   RoussillonHow to Save on ActivitiesWith so much to see in French, sightseeing can quickly become expensive. To save money, you can use the Paris Museum Pass.It will let you skip the long lines at most of the top attractions, and it includes admission to the Louvre and Orsay Museums, Sainte-Chapelle Church, and Palace of Versailles. If you don’t want to use the pass, you’ll definitely want to book your tickets in advance for the Eiffel Tower and Versailles to save time!Read More: Top Things to Do in Paris Pay Less for CoffeeIf you’re a caffeine addict like me, you’ll want to take advantage of the cheap coffee in France to save money. If you order your cup of joe inside a cafe at the counter, it will cost you less.For orders outside at a table that require a waiter, you’ll end up paying more. So head up to counter, choose from a selection of pastries (if you’re feeling peckish) and find a spot on a nearby public bench or park to enjoy your coffee.    Tipping in FranceTipping isn’t necessary in France because a service charge is already included in your bill. At some restaurants, there are separate prices for a “sur place” and “emporter.”A “sur place” means you will eat the food at the restaurant and it’s more expensive than the “emporter” (take away). At bars and cafes, a small tip is welcomed (think 10% for good service) and for cab drivers, I like to round up within a euro or two. OverallIf you’re into planning all your trips down to the last detail, it can always feel overwhelming visiting a country for the first time. Hopefully, these tips will help you feel less stressed and have made organizing your itinerary for France that much easier! Do you have tips for first-time travelers to France?

Gordes is home to narrow winding streets, pastel buildings and a weekly market that’s becoming more popular by the year.After spending a few days exploring Provence, I arrived in Gordes on a Tuesday morning.

Its 100-year old fish market opens at 8 am and is a great spot to grab a light breakfast.Head to one of the cafes on the water edge, order a croissant and cafe au lait and watch the currents rock the old wooden boats in the distance.Visit the Basilique Notre Dame de la GardeAfter breakfast, take the Petit train up to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. It’s a scenic trip that will take you along a seaside road and past the forts of Pharo Palace and St Victor’s Abbey.The Notre Dame de la Garde sits at the highest point of Marseille and is one of the most iconic symbols of the city.

It’s the oldest neighborhood in Marseille and is known for its cobbled streets, cute vintage shops, street art, and historical buildings.Spend your afternoon wandering around Vielle Charité. It’s a 17th-century almshouse that’s been turned into a cultural center. You’ll find several museums, a cinema and exhibition halls.Before leaving, make the climb up to Cathédrale de la Major.Watch the Sunset at La Porte d’OrientCatch a local bus and explore further along the coast before the day ends. I recommend arriving at La Porte d’Orient just as the sun starts to go down.You’ll be in time to watch the light rays dip between the statues outstretched arms, making for an epic serendipitous sunset.Fine Dining at L’EpuisetteIf you have room in your budget to splurge on a fine dining experience, you can’t go wrong with a table at L’Epuisette. It serves some of the best bouillabaisses in Marseille and overlooks the fishing port of Vallon des Auffes.Bookings are essential! Day Trip from MarseilleIf you have the time, go on a day trip to Calanques. Designated a national park in 2012, it stretches from Marseille to La Ciotat.The park is known for its striking turquoise water and limestone cliffs.It’s by far one of the most beautiful national parks in Europe! If you have the chance and the weather is warm enough, find somewhere to jump in and go for a swim. OverallI think it’s safe to say I’ve got a little crush on Marseille. While I didn’t arrive expecting much from France’s second biggest city, it found a way to sneak into my heart. Have you ever been to Marseille? Do you have any tips?

Spend some time wandering around, then make your way up to the Bell Tower for incredible views of the hills.The thirteenth century King’s Tower will give you a taste of history, and I’d recommend checking out the catacombs tour if you have time. While it’s fun to get around to all of the cultural spots, Saint Emilion is truly about indulging.Famous for its Grand Cru wine, this little town is actually one of Bordeaux’s biggest winemakers.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-gorges-du-verdon-in-france/,Tips for Visiting Gorges du Verdon in France,France,"Located in southeastern France in the heart of Provence, the gorgeous Gorges du Verdon took my breath away at first sight. Also known as Verdon Gorge in English, this iconic spot is a dramatic line of limestone cliffs that make up the deepest gorge in France.Not far from the iconic French Riviera, Gorges du Verdon is popular with tourists, and it’s the perfect place to spend a sunny day out.Ready for the perfect afternoon in the French countryside? Here are my tips for visiting Gorges du Verdon in France.About Gorges Du VerdonThis area has such a fascinating history. When the region was underwater 250 million years, seashells, coral, and the seafloor built up and were eventually compressed into the limestone rock.As plates moved, the seafloor rose up and the limestone peaks were formed. When the Ice Age came along, glaciers wore away further at the limestone and created the dramatic cliffs that you see today.The place got its name from the gorgeous turquoise water that flows through the gorge. “Gorges du Verdon” means “gorges of green” in French.Getting ThereLes Gorges du Verdon lies right in the center of the Provence region of France, and it is an easy day trip from the French Riviera. However, while you can get there and back in one day, I’d recommend staying in the area for a couple of days rather than rushing back to the Riviera.The closest town to the lake entrance is Moustiers-Sainte-Marie. When you arrive there, you will want to drive six kilometers out in the direction of Lac de Ste-Croix until you reach the bridge called Pont du Galetas.To rent a boat, you just have to just get to the bridge. I’d recommend using GPS on your trip to get around easily.You can find the exact location of the Pont du Galetas bridge on Google Maps to give you an idea of where you will want to go. Once you are at the bridge, you will find a choice of boat rental outlets.Read More: Essential Tips for Driving in ProvenceExploring Gorges du VerdonI would recommend starting your day early in Gorges du Verdon, especially during the summer. It is a popular spot during the summer months so you will want to beat the crowd.Not only will you want to have plenty of time to explore Gorges du Verdon and wander around to take photos, but there are endless opportunities for adventures here. If you are ready for a heart-racing afternoon, bring your climbing gear.There are over 1500 incredible routes for climbers. Just keep in mind that there aren’t many casual paths. You’ll want to have hiking shoes at the very least to explore.For a more low-key day out, you can rent a paddle boat or kayak. Plan for a couple of hours to make your way around the beautiful Lac de Sainte-Croix.To rent a boat, get to the bridge called Pont du Galetas. I’d recommend using GPS on your trip if you’re driving in Provence. You can find the exact location of the Pont du Galetas bridge on Google Maps to get an idea of where you will want to go.Once you are at the bridge, you will just need to find parking then can head to the beach to swim or rent a paddle boat.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to ProvenceI was honestly so surprised to stumble across a place like this in France. I had such a lovely afternoon here hanging on the beach, swimming around, reading a few chapters from a new book and cooling off from the insane summer heat!If you’re passing through the area, a stop at Gorges du Verdon is a must!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-provence/,The Ultimate Guide to Provence,France,"Provence, France, known for its diverse landscapes, miles of vineyards, lavender fields, and crystal blue waters, is indeed a traveler’s dream. I recently got to visit, and it was everything that I hoped for and more.If you have the opportunity to spend 3-5 days exploring Provence I highly recommend doing so. I chose to stay in Avignon and spent a few days wandering around.To make your itinerary planning a little easier, I’ve put together my ultimate guide to Provence with all the can’t miss spots!Day 1 – ArrivalWhenever I arrive at a destination, I like to spend my first afternoon relaxing and getting settled in, and this was no different in Provence.Avignon: As I mentioned, I chose Avignon as my home base to explore Provence from. It’s a beautiful medieval city with an old town that’s been named a UNESCO world heritage site. Check into your hotel and explore the town on foot.Visit Palais des Papes: I stayed in the center of it all, near the Palais des Papes, one of the most significant and important medieval Gothic buildings in Europe.Helpful Tip: Parking in Avignon is impossible, so head straight to the parking structure in Palais des Papes. The entrance is right outside of the city walls (you’ll see an electronic parking sign). It’s not only cheap but also conveniently located.Keep in mind that it will be hot in the summer and there’s no ventilation in the parking structure. On your way into the city, remember to bring your parking ticket with you as many of the hotels will validate it for you.Whether you love grand architecture or you’re fascinated with history, be sure to take a tour of the palace. It’s the biggest gothic fortress in the world. Tickets start at about €16.50, and you can find several different tours.Visit the Pont Du Gard Aqueduct: 30 Minute Drive from Avignon. Built in the 1st century AD, the Pont de Gard is one of the best preserved Roman constructions on earth. It’s also a UNESCO world heritage site.Pack a swimsuit, pick up a few groceries for a picnic dinner, and drive out to the Pont Du Gard aqueduct for sunset. Fun Fact: It’s the most visited ancient monument in France. Plus, it’s only €8.50 per adult to visit and includes parking.After crossing the 48-meter high bridge, find a spot to set up your picnic. Enjoy a glass of wine and a swim as the sun sets over Avignon. It’s truly a unique sight that you can’t find anywhere else.Drive Back to Avignon: 30 Minute Drive Back to Avignon. On your way back into the city, pull over just outside of the city walls and catch a glimpse of the fortified city at night. The Palais de Papes is also something to marvel at after dark.If you’re up for it, grab a glass of wine, and people watch near the palace. There’s usually something always going on in the center of town that you won’t want to miss.Read More: Essential Tips for Driving in ProvenceDay 2 – Lavender FieldsHere is where the fun begins!First thing in the morning, pack your car up for a full day. I’m talking swimsuits, more picnic supplies (bread, cheese, snacks, etc.), beach towels and mats, a change of clothes, water, and even toilet paper.Visit the Lavender Fields: 1 hour 40 Minute Drive from Avignon. Provence is known for its lavender and sunflower fields. Depending on the time of year that you visit, you will be able to catch them. I was in Provence August 5th-8th which is very late to see the lavender fields.The best time to see the fields is in June or July. If you have a trip planned after those months, you can alter your itinerary as necessary since the lavender is usually gone by August.I, however, was fortunate. I headed out to Valensole and just before reaching the famous Plateau de Valensole, I found one last field remaining!There is also a cute little souvenir shop nearby that has lavender gifts where I got some lavender oil. Valensole is also the ideal spot to stop for lunch if you’re getting a bit hungry.Alternative Destinations: If you do plan a trip for during a time where the lavender will be gone, you can skip Valensole completely and head to another destination. I have a list of some tops spots listed at the end of this post.Read More: Where to Find Sunflower & Lavender Fields in ProvenceStop at Sunflower Fields: Regardless of where you end up, you will most likely pass vast sunflower fields throughout the Provence region.Visit Gorges du Verdon: 1 hour 20 Minute Drive from Valensole. I was a little hesitant about driving all the way to Gorges du Verdon (which is about an hour and 15 minutes away from Valensole), but I’m so glad I did! Verdon Gorge is known for its turquoise green river water, white water rafting, and hiking.Before settling down on the beach, drive along the canyon for views down onto the river. You’re going to want to stop every few minutes to take pictures. It’s absolutely breathtaking.Catch Sunset in Sault: 2 Hour 30 Minute Drive from Verdon Gorge. Prepare for a long drive back to Sault (but it’s worth the trek). Sault was one of the most insane little towns to drive through in all of Provence, so be prepared to squeeze through narrow roads and navigate sharp turns. I made it to Sault just before sunset and grabbed a romantic little dinner for one at Le Petit Jardin. (It was one of the best pasta dishes I’ve ever had!)Helpful Tip: I drove back to my hotel in Avignon after dark and realized just how dark it is on roads in the countryside. Most roads have no street lights, so be careful if you’re driving anywhere at night!Read More: Tips for Exploring the Village of SaultDay 3 – The LuberonHelpful Tip: Service is spotty throughout Provence but especially in the Luberon region. Download an offline google map of your driving route from Gordes to Senanque Abbey to Roussilon so you know where you’re going.Visit Gordes: 1 hour Drive from Avignon. When I was planning my trip to Provence, I knew that I had to visit Gordes, one of the most well-known hilltop villages in the region. I wanted to go to the farmer’s market that happens every Tuesday morning and consists of stalls set up all around the foot of the castle.Here you’ll find fabrics, linens, soaps, lavender, clothes, and an abundance of food and wine. I chose to (and recommend) getting there early to help beat some of the crowds.Tour the Senanque Abbey: 10 Minute Drive from Gordes. Once you’re shopped out, just down the hill, you will find the Senanque Abbey, a fully functioning monastery that was founded in the 12th century. They have guided tours that start every hour, and it’s one of the best ways to soak in all of the information that comes with the gorgeous abbey.This is also another trendy spot to see some lavender fields if it’s the right season.Explore Roussillon: 30 Minute Drive from Senanque Abbey. Finish up your day by making the quick drive over to Roussillon, one of my favorite towns. Plan to spend a few hours here to explore the town and walk the ochre trail. The town is full of old red buildings with colorful doors and the ochre trail is a beautiful nature trail through natural red quarries and cliffs.Read More: Tips for Visiting RoussillonOther Destinations to Visit in ProvenceThis was my 3-day itinerary for Provence but if you have more time or you’re looking for different destinations than the ones I mentioned, here are a few others that are worth visiting!Aix En Provence: 1 Hour Drive from Avignon. Known as the “brainiest” city in France, it’s known for bringing in artists, lawyers, and nobles. There are reportedly 1,000 fountains you can visit, thermal hot springs, bookstores, markets, boutiques, and open-air restaurants where you can wine and dine.Saint Remy de Provence: 30 Minute Drive from Avignon. Saint Remy de Provence means enjoying the incredible landscapes of the Massif des Alpilles, with the town resting right at its foot.They receive over 300 days a year of sunshine, so it’s no wonder people flock to enjoy the weather, the museums, the private mansions from the Renaissance, the chapels, and the art galleries.If you get the chance to go to Saint Remy de Provence, visit the Monastery of Saint-Paul de Mausolé, the spot known to have taken in and inspired Vincent Van Gogh. It’s where he painted 150 of his most well-known works.Les Baux de Provence: 40 Minute Drive from Avignon. Les Baux de Provence is a medieval village at a fortified rocky site in between Arles and Saint Remy de Provence. This one is best to be treated as a day trip as there is so much to see within the town.Some of its highlights include the village itself, Chateau-Fortress de Bau, Eglise St-Vincent, and Musee des Santons.Orange – Château Neuf du Pape: 30 Minute Drive from Avignon. One of the best ways to visit these spots is to take a guided tour. During this tour, you will pop in between charming little villages, Roman ruins, and taste wine in old cellars.It’s one of the most popular tours in Provence, so I highly recommend checking it out!Côte d’Azur: 2 Hour 30 Minute Drive from Avignon. The French Riviera is famous for its old glamour and beautiful coastline. Famous seaside towns like Antibes, Nice, Cannes, and St Tropez are some of the most popular destinations. Head to the French Riviera for sun-soaked days by the sea!Provence is an unforgettable destination that offers not only history but views that will have you in awe. There’s so much to do, so stay organized with an itinerary and ensure you see all that you’d like! PIN ME!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-by-train-in-france/,The Ultimate Guide to Traveling By Train in France,France,"Train travel in France is an easy, affordable, and sustainable way to get around and see all that the county has to offer. There are over 1700 kilometers of high-speed train lines all over France.One of the best parts about traveling by train is the fact that there are stations in almost every city rather than only near the airports. Whether you want to go to Paris, Bordeaux, Nice, Avignon, St. Émilion, or even Disneyland Paris, there’s a train you can catch.Especially if you don’t speak French, the process of traveling by train can be a bit confusing (more on my tragic personal experience below).To avoid any issues, read on for the ultimate guide to traveling by train in France!Where to Buy Tickets + Train PricesOne of the best ways to see all of your options is to check online ahead of time. You can see all of your choices (duration, price, etc.) online at SNCF.As surprising as it seems, trains can and do fill up ahead of time depending on the destination. Book early to help you plan out your trips and ensure that you’ll have a ticket when the time comes. This is especially essential if you’re traveling in high seasons like summer. If you do decide to book last minute, you can quickly get tickets at the train stations no matter what language you speak.Pricing all depends on the trip itself though many tickets start as low as €8 (about USD $10) for short trips. For exact pricing, you can go to the tickets and booking portal.First Class vs. Second ClassI usually lean towards comfortable travel vs saving on price– especially when I’m traveling solo. For such a small price difference, you get a big difference in comfort when riding in 1st class on trains in France.When traveling solo, you can book single window seats online– which I love!First class usually also has a power outlet, large reclining seats, laptop sized foldable tables, free WiFi (depending on the route), a snack cart (with food available for purchase), luggage racks, and toilets.Helpful Tip: First class tickets are assigned specific seat numbers, so be sure to look on your ticket for the carriage number and seat number that you are assigned.Second class tickets are less expensive, obviously, but they aren’t a huge downgrade. There is just less space and fewer comforts.Validate Your TicketIt might seem straightforward once you’ve booked your tickets and you are ready to go but here are some tips that will help ensure you catch your train without any hiccups.Before you head out, make sure to validate your ticket at one of the bright yellow machines inside of every station. Failure to do so will result in a fine. Although, I have read that if you do happen to forget and you ask for validation on board, there’s a good chance they’ll do so (though they might charge a small fee).I never had any issues with validation, so as long as you keep your ticket on you so you can show it to the train attendant when they come through to check.How to Find Your TrainOnce you are at the train station, keep an eye out for your train platform. Your train platform will NOT be on your ticket. The platform is posted about 20 minutes before departure.Another vital tip– do not look for your destination on the departures list. The trains are listed by number and where they terminate. Instead, look for your train number and be aware that some trains make multiple stops may terminate at a different destination.I missed my train to Avignon because I was looking for Avignon as the train destination. Had I been looking for my train number, I would have seen that it was a train terminating in Paris (Avignon not listed). So I ended up on a regional train that took 2 hours instead of 30 minutes.Last, but not least, my final tip is to enjoy yourself. Did you know that having a picnic during a train ride is a bit of a French tradition? Pack a baguette, some cheese and a single serving bottle of wine. I can’t think of many things better than snacking on delicious food as the French scenery glides by!Read More: Itinerary for Traveling Europe by Train"
https://theblondeabroad.com/essential-tips-for-driving-in-provence/,Essential Tips for Driving in Provence,France,"There’s so much to see when driving throughout France, but if you’ve never driven there before, it can be a little intimidating. While I love to travel through France by train, you’ll need a car to explore the Provence region properly. With countless hilltop villages and endless fields of lavender, you’ll want to be able to drive and stop to explore at your own pace.Here are my essential tips for driving in Provence helping you understand the roads better!Rules of the RoadFirst things first, cars drive on the right side of the road with the driver on the left side of the vehicle. So, if you’re from the US, nothing is different! If possible, when you first arrive, practice on roads without heavy traffic. This will allow you to get comfortable with the flow of traffic and the rules of the road.The RoadsMuch like the rest of Europe, some of the smaller towns have incredibly narrow roadways that can be highly unnerving if you haven’t driven through them before. You’ll most likely find these types of roads out in the countryside. But, don’t fret, there are also plenty of highways with lots of space.One town, in particular, Sault, was one of the sketchiest towns to drive in. I was driving a reasonably small Fiat and had to tuck in the side mirrors to get through some of the roads in the village. The countryside roads can also be incredibly windy with hairpin turns down steep hills, so mind your speed.Those same countryside roads can be very dark once the sun goes down. There are few street lights and traffic lights, so exercise caution.Driving from city to city in Provence doesn’t take long though. The farthest I ever drove was 2 hours in one direction, including stops along the way.Renting a CarRenting a car with an automatic transmission can be a little tricky. If you’re not familiar with a stick shift, be sure to book a car in advance as there are limited automatic vehicles available.Because the roads can be a bit narrow, having a small car will make it easier to maneuver around the city. Something along the lines of a Fiat 500 works perfectly. Be aware of getting something too small though, as some of the cobblestone roads and unpaved areas are bumpy and could cause damage to the undercarriage if you bottom out.I found the Fiat 500 to be a perfect size and, even though I was traveling alone, it could easily fit a small family comfortably. The car had backup cameras, a Bluetooth sound system, and GPS which made my ride comfortable. I wouldn’t skimp on the bells and whistles in Provence if you plan to be driving a lot (especially in the summer). It’s hot, and you’ll be in the car a lot!Duh Duh Duh Gas-o-linaIn the US, I’m used to paying for gas or “petrol” at the pump, so it is helpful to know ahead of time how to fill up wherever I’m traveling. In France, you will head inside to pay an attendant before you can pump. You can choose to pay a specific amount with cash or card. Or, if you want to fill up completely, you can leave your credit card with the attendant, fill until you’re full, then return inside to pay.Don’t forget to fill up your tank before returning your rental car!And, just how much money are you going to spend on gas? I spent about €90 on gas in 3 days (approx. 600 km).Air ConditioningIf you’ve traveled to, or are from Europe, you’re very aware that air conditioning is a rare luxury during the summers. While most modern cars are equipped with A/C, it’s worth confirming on your rental. You’ll find that your car might be your only cold air relief while exploring the villages of Provence, as many restaurants and shops might not have more than a fan.Trust me; you’re going to want that cool breeze the minute you get to your car. I was in Provence during a massive heat wave where most days broke 100°F/38°C! I could only walk around in the beating sun for so long before I’d need to run back to the car to blast the A/C and wipe my sweat. And, to top that off, it would take 10 minutes before I could even touch the steering wheel.You might also want to consider grabbing a windshield reflector to help keep those car temps down.Toll RoadsToll roads are pretty straightforward in France. When passing through a toll, grab a ticket and drive off.When it comes time to get off the motorway, have cash or your credit card ready. Visa, Eurocard, and Mastercard are accepted so have your wallet handy if you plan on doing a lot of driving.Prepare for No Public ToiletsThroughout Provence, you might find yourself struggling to find a public restroom, especially a free one. This is especially true in the distant villages. I kid you not, I stopped 5 times at different gas stations, restaurants, and even grocery stores and nobody had a toilet that I could use. I wouldn’t usually recommend this, but you might need to take care of business in nature in some parts of the region.Be sure to stock your car with toilet paper, wipes, and hand sanitizer.Always Be Prepared for a SwimIt might sound random, but you’d be surprised at how many swimming spots I found in places I didn’t expect. I wished I had a towel and bathing suit on hand so I could jump in at a moments notice. Spots like Verdon Gorge and Pont du Gard are must-swim spots when visiting the area and offer cool relief from the summer heat.Keep a swimsuit and towel in your car (just in case)!Motorcyclists and PedestriansMotorcycles are extremely popular in Provence, so most of the drivers are very familiar with sharing the roads. Just be sure to remember that it is legal for cyclists to filter between lanes.Many French drivers choose to move to the right to allow the cyclist to pass by quickly.That same attention applies to pedestrians. In many situations, walkers will not wait for the okay to cross the street and they always have the right of way.You might come across drivers who ignore many of the crossings and go ahead anyway. The safest option is to keep an eye out for pedestrians, but try to follow the flow of traffic.PicnicWhat would a road trip be without snacks and beverages? Stock up before you leave to cut down on the stops you make during your drive. The picnic is a thing of beauty in France. With so much local bread, cheese, wine, olives, honey, fruits, and vegetables throughout Provence, you can go crazy at the local markets. I often found more people stopped on the side of the road to picnic than to eat in restaurants mid-day.At the very least, pack a LOT of water. I stocked up on big bottles of water to keep with me at all times and refill my personal water bottle that I carried around while exploring the towns throughout the day.One thing to keep in mind when planning these trips is that many things close mid-day (12:20-3:30 PM), so be sure to grab what you need before or after those times!Understand the RoundaboutsThere are plenty of roundabouts (also called traffic circles) throughout Provence, so if you’re unfamiliar with them, you’ll want to study up before you go. As you approach the roundabout, you’ll find there are several kinds of directional signs, pointing you in the direction you need to go.Oncoming traffic is supposed to yield to those that are already in the roundabout.There are both single lane and multi-lane roundabouts throughout Provence, so refer to this guide for a quick guide to navigating them.ParkingThere isn’t always a convenient parking spot when you’re driving through Provence, so be prepared to park on a curb, sidewalk or patch on the side of the road. You’ll often see cars parallel parked over curbs on the sidewalk in some of the small villages with narrow streets.In most towns, there are parking lots, but they fill up on market days and in the afternoon. If you arrive early in the morning, you should have a better chance of finding space in a lot.Carry CashSmaller villages tend to be a bit more old-fashioned, and many of them might not take credit cards. If you’re looking to shop at local markets, or buy souvenirs from small vendors, be sure to have some cash on hand.Study the Road SignsThe road signs in Provence are pretty different from the US. If you don’t understand the road signs while driving, you will quickly become a danger to yourself and other drivers.The two most important signs that you’ll come across are “DO NOT ENTER” and the “narrow road” sign for two way traffic. Here is some more information on the most important road signs to know in France before you go.Some of the driving situations in Provence can be a bit nerve-wracking, especially if you aren’t familiar with the French language. Follow these tips, and you’ll have an amazing and carefree road trip!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-mandarin-oriental-paris/,Staying at Mandarin Oriental Paris,France,"Ahh Paris, the city of love. And shopping and incredible food. Paris has it all.There are so many hotels to choose from in the city which can be extremely overwhelming. I had the chance to stay at Mandarin Oriental Paris and with its luxurious rooms, amenities, and unforgettable food, it was the experience of a lifetime.Here’s my experience staying at Mandarin Oriental Paris hotel in France!Getting ThereThere is a bit of distance between Paris CDG Airport and Mandarin Oriental Paris. If you’re looking to drive or take a taxi, your ride is going to take you about 25 minutes.If you’re looking for a cheaper (yet longer) option, there is the Roissybus or train. Both depart every 20-30 minutes and are going to take you about 45-50 minutes total. But you’ll only be paying about $13-$17 USD.The HotelThis contemporary yet whimsical hotel tucked away in camellia tree gardens, sits right on Rue Saint-Honoré– one of Paris’ most upmarket shopping streets.While the shopping is nothing short of chic, the area itself is a bit quieter than other spots in Paris. Yet you will still be able to find many things extremely close like the River Seine, Musée d’Orsay, and even the Louvre, one of Paris’ most well-known attractions.If you’re looking for a family-friendly option, look no further. There is a dedicated children’s concierge, mini bathrobes, and video games to keep the little ones entertained.If you’re looking for a more romantic adult-geared experience, there’s also an indoor swimming pool and a spa with private spa suites for two and steam showers. Upon arrival, expect a glass of champagne waiting for you, as a warm welcome to the city.The RoomsWith a total of 138 spacious rooms, Mandarin Oriental Paris offers 13 different types of rooms and suites, varying from Mandarin Room to the 2700 square foot Royale Mandarin Suite. For a true Parisian experience, try to book a room on a higher floor for the chance of a view of the Eiffel Tower.During my stay, I was in the Deluxe Room that offered a gorgeous view of the hotel garden. With its art deco decor, I felt like a true Parisian. The room itself included a walk-in shower, a stand-alone bath, a flatscreen television, and a Nespresso coffee machine.If you’ve ever been to Paris, you know that the rooms tend to run a bit on the small side but I can assure you, these rooms will seem large in comparison.Food & DrinkWhile there are many hotels throughout Paris, it’s not often that you find one with a two-star Michelin restaurant. Sur Mesure par Tarry Marx offers not only incredible service but also an almost out of this world experience.The walls and ceiling are draped in white fabric, giving the impression of weightless clouds creating an unbelievably sensory experience.And let’s not forget about the food. Serving lunch and dinner, they offer a 4-6 course meal prepared by one of the most celebrated chefs in France.If you’re looking for a more relaxed atmosphere, Camélia, located on the ground floor, offers a variety of options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The best part of this modern hot spot is it’s large glass windows that offer a view of the peaceful courtyard garden.More InformationAccommodation: LuxuryLocation: 1st ArrondissementPrice: $$$Want to earn points for your hotel stays and earn miles toward your next adventure?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/discovering-ancestry-with-23andme/,Discovering My Ancestry With 23andMe,France,"The United States is a country of immigrants and we all have a longing to know where we come from. You frequently hear Americans, even if they’re born in the USA, talking about being “Irish American,” “Latin American,” or “Italian American” as a way of connecting to where their ancestors once came from.As for me, I’d never really had a clue about my roots. As far as my family could recollect, we’d been in the US for a really long time. All of my grandparents have passed away, so I sort of ran out of options for learning more about where I came from. So, when 23andMe approached me, I couldn’t wait to try it and see what I could learn about my heritage.Here’s my experience discovering my ancestry with 23andMe!Tracing my AncestryWhile my last living grandpa was still alive, I wanted to make sure that I took the opportunity to talk with him to learn more about what he knew of our family. To my surprise, he didn’t know much. He knew his dad was born in the USA, and that his parents’ parents were also born in the USA. But, he couldn’t tell me much more beyond that.So, that same year, I spent months retracing our family tree, filling in missing data and researching everything I could find that told me a little bit more about my ancestors. I was actually able to trace my family tree back 7 generations (I even connected with a long lost second cousin) and I got to share all that exciting information with my grandpa before he died.But, even with gathering information on my lineage for the past 7 generations, I still found my family in the USA. I literally retraced my ancestors to the Revolutionary War. How could anyone be SO American?? I guess I can! However, this was a single branch in a very complicated tree. Because I only traced my paternal grandfather’s genealogy (my last name), there were still a lot of missing pieces I couldn’t put together without DNA testing.How 23andMe WorksAfter getting a more intimate understanding of my family tree, I was excited to take things to the next level. I’d heard a lot about 23andMe, and I decided to finally try it out.23andMe actually offers two services you can choose from: Ancestry Service or Health + Ancestry Service. If you have never used a service like this, it all starts with a saliva collection kit. After you receive your saliva collection kit in the mail, the process is easy! You simply follow the instructions, provide your saliva sample, and return it in the pre-paid package provided. After six to eight weeks, detailed reports are provided to you in your secure online account.The 23andMe Health + Ancestry Service provides insights on health, traits, wellness, ancestry and more. They analyze and compile your results into 90+ reports you can access online and share with your family!The 23andMe Ancestry Service helps you understand your DNA breakdown across 150+ regions worldwide so you can see where your ancestors lived. They provide reports on your Ancestry Composition, Maternal & Paternal Haplogroups, Neanderthal Ancestry, and provide a DNA Relatives tool that you can opt into so you can connect with relatives who share similar DNA.My 23andMe ResultsWhen you get your 23andMe reports back, you receive quite a bit of information. It’s very comprehensive and they explain what your results mean. I was excited to get to see my ancestry composition. According to my 23andMe Ancestry Composition report, I am:99.4% European0.4% Western Asian & North African0.1% Unassigned (so mysterious!)From that 99.4% European, they break it down into the regions that your ancestry would have most likely descended from. Of course, like so many Americans, my family has come from a range of different regions. The majority of my heritage (31.1%) is French and German, with the next largest percentage (20.3%) being British and Irish Ancestry.I love the little history facts included in the report!One of the most interesting aspects of the 23andMe service is the Neanderthal Ancestry report. I got a kick out of seeing that I have more Neanderthal variants than 68% of 23andMe customers! According to 23andMe, your Neanderthal Ancestry accounts for less than 4% of your overall DNA.Why I  Decided to Explore FranceI haven’t spent a significant amount of time exploring France. After seeing that French and German made up the highest percent of my European roots, I was looking forward to getting better acquainted with the place, and seeing more of the highlights of the beautiful country.So, I packed my bags and, in less than a month, boarded a plane for a solo trip through France!Of course, I started with a tour of Paris. The City of Lights is one of the most beautiful places in the world. From the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre to the delicious Parisian food and underground nightclubs, two days barely gave me enough time to scratch the surface.My next stop was Saint-Émilion and Bordeaux—just a short train ride from Paris. I couldn’t wait to see this famous French wine region, and I was blown away by its beauty. I spent a couple of days there and got the chance to stay in one of the gorgeous old chateaus dotting the Saint-Émilion countryside, Le Pavillon Villemaurine.Next on my list was the region of Provence, situated on southeastern France and bordering Italy and the Mediterranean Sea! It was supposed to be amongst the most impressive areas in the country, and it exceeded all my expectations. I rented a car to be able to visit more of the Luberon region—a region full of vineyards, orchards, hilltop villages—and drove through the beautiful towns of Gordes, Roussillon, Saint- Rémy-de-Provence, and more.Unfortunately, it was too late in the year to see their famed lavender and flower fields. But, nevertheless, the region was full of stunning landscapes.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to ProvenceFor my last couple of days in France, I headed down to the Côte d’Azur, the French Riviera. Iconic spots like Marseille, Cassis, Nice, and Menton offer stunning coastlines and true French charm. I spent two days making my way down the coast by train and lapping up the beautiful weather.My ExperienceWhen I started traveling back in 2011, most of my trips were solo. It’s actually been a few years since I’ve taken a proper trip with me, myself and I. The entire trip was a whirlwind of hot summer sun, winding cobblestone streets and cute French cafés.I’m so glad I took the 23andMe Health + Ancestry service and learned about my ancestry because, while I can’t re-write the pages of my personal family history, being in France made me feel like I helped bring some of my family back from the forgotten. It’s a bit crazy to think that in just a few generations, our lives might be a distant memory, but I feel more connected to my heritage than ever. This post was written in sponsorship with 23andMe.

https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-paris/,Where to Find the Best Food in Paris,France,"This Paris Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!Paris was a slow burner for me. It’s not that I disliked it early on, but it wasn’t love-at-first-sight like other places have been before. Each time I visit I find myself falling into it a little deeper though, and I’m beginning to understand and believe the mantra that Paris is the city of love, and one of the best cities in the world at that.My latest visit pushed the caliber way ahead.  Paris breeds a sensation of passion that is palpable within the neighborhoods, and that pours into the food being produced.  I found sophistication and attention to detail, yet with a sense of simplicity and softness.Paris is a city I have at this point been lucky enough to spend a lot of time in on multiple occasions.  I’ve walked Montmartre, visited the Musee de Louvre, seen the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Notre-Dame cathedral.What that means, of course, is being at the point where less sightseeing is in the mix, and more local exploring can be done, entirely guilt free.Here’s where I found the best food in Paris!Le Mary CelesteLe Mary Celeste is a funky, open-air bar with a strong sense of self and energy you feel the moment you step foot inside.  There are bright splashes of color everywhere, complementing the orange negronis you’ll likely see scattered about in the hip young patron’s hands.The food was the real killer though, flying a bit under the radar within the larger food scene yet equally impressive.  Get the deviled eggs with pickled onions and scallions, and the burrata splashed with apricot and tamarind, and you’ll be guaranteed a perfect start to the night ahead.Septime La CaveNot being able to get a reservation at Septime was nothing short of soul-destroying for me.  I tried multiple ways, and I failed multiple times. Where I found myself instead was its spinoff wine bar, Septime La Cave, located around the corner from Septime and its sister restaurant Clamato.Super small and charming, the menu on the wall lists the day’s three kinds of cheese, olives, beef with mozzarella cheese, and a couple of other offerings.Complement that with a glass or two of wine, and you have yourself an experience that is fully French and wholly enjoyable.HolybellyHolybelly is quirky, it’s fun, it’s a little bit American feeling, and it’s perfectly great. The music is heavy on the Michael Jackson and Prince spectrum, and the wifi password is macauleyculkin, if that helps to give any insight.Make your own breakfast plate with eggs and sides like champignons, bacon or grilled halloumi, or go lighter with chia seed pudding or yogurt, fruit, and granola.Du Pains Et Des IdesBoulangeries are everywhere, on nearly every corner of this bustling, lovely city. Du Pains Et Des Ides is in Saint Martin, about a five-minute walk from the canal, and churns out a pistachio and chocolate pastry that is a must-have.Le ServanLe Servan is a portrayal of French refinement and casual sophistication all in one. Located in an area that feels off the beaten path yet alive and full of life, Le Servan seemed to me to be a perfect example of where a local would choose to go for a relaxed, yet equally special meal.Frenchie Bar A VinsThe wine bars in Paris operate at a whole other level than those in other cities. DMX and Biggie amongst the stellar playlist set the stage for one of the favorite meals of the trip.Another spinoff, Frenchie is the restaurant, Frenchie Bar A Vins is the wine bar across the street, with the job of offering smaller plates in a more casual “spontaneous” setting. The burrata was the highlight, complemented by pear, lemon, and dates.The pastas are standouts too- if the gnocchi and pollack are on the menu, do it.Fragments ParisWhile admittedly not the most authentic Parisian locale I could have chosen, Fragments has its place in the French food chain. I know my avocado toasts, and Fragments is one of the best.Go in the morning, and then wander the incredible streets in Le Marais.MiznonMiznon is a falafel joint, sans falafel. Located in the Jewish district within Le Marais, there are a couple of excellent spots here for all things fried chickpea and hummus related (L’As being the most famous, and with the longest line).Miznon took this theme and gave it a twist. While pita is still the backdrop of the sandwich, the falafel is now absent and replaced with a dozen plus different fillers, most notably grilled cauliflower in tahini and lamb with steamed cabbage.Breizh CaféIt’s tough to visit Paris without being tempted by a crepe. They’re everywhere.  When you finally give in to temptation—which you inevitably will—make sure you find yourself here.  Go sweet or go savory; either way, you’ll end up pretty happy.Others to note: Clown Bar / Le Chateaubriand / Clamato / Astier / Grand Coen / Cafe de FloreWhere are your favorite places to eat in Paris?

And, just as I expected, I fell in love!The pebbled coastline, cute towns, and topaz sea were calling, and I answered.While I only had a day to visit Nice, it was enough time to get a taste for this famous town in the Côte d’Azur. Nice is the birthplace of the massive tourism boom to the South of France in the 1920s and has been a haven for everyone from artists to the elite for over a century.If you’re lucky enough to visit on a Monday, like me, you will get a very unique feast for the senses at the Brocante. This antiques market takes over Cours Saleya where you can find French treasures like vintage postcards, costume jewelry and everything in between.When you visit Nice, you must have an empty stomach, a bikini and a bottle of rosé. Lunch at Castel Plage was one of my favorite dining experiences in the entire South of France.Delicious food, an incredible seafront table and a chill bottle of rosé = a happy girl.So when you visit Nice, start your morning in Cours Saleya with an espresso and a big smile, then continue by foot through the small streets and along the beach. Your heart will lead you from there.Read More: How to Spend 48 Hours in NiceDo you have travel tips for Nice? Let me know in the comments below!"

Paris is charming and magical, but this doesn’t mean other French cities should be overlooked! One place in France that has endless opportunities to offer is Lyon.Around the city, you can find a Roman amphitheater, medieval and Renaissance architecture in Vieux Lyon, and the modern, redeveloped Confluence district on the Presqu’île peninsula between the two rivers that run through town.From the scenery and history to nightlife and traditional cuisine, here are six reasons to visit Lyon, France!Parc de la Tête d’OrThis park one of the top parks in France, maybe even Europe! It starts as a fairly standard park with a greenhouse and extensive flora display. But as you keep making your way into the park, the beautiful flowers and magnificent trees take a side view of the animals.That’s right, in the middle of the park is a zoo! The water features around the park have turtles swimming around, and if you stand by the stone fences, you’ll see deer and ostrich on the other side enjoying their open grassy fields. Walk a little further around the zoo, and you’ll come to the giant letters that spell only ONLY LYONS with a giant red lion statue beside it.You got it; these letters are the perfect photo opportunity to get a cheesy tourist pic to rival the IAMSTERDAM!Old LyonVieux Lyon is the perfect place to get a feel for the history of Lyon. With stunning buildings and churches dating back thousands of years, Lyon’s past shines on this side of town.Take the long, but totally worth it, walk up to the Lyon cathedral- here you’ll get unbeatable views of this beautiful city!The Rhône RiverLyon is a dual-river city, and both riverbanks are a must-see. There are a bunch of boats that are converted to restaurants and cafes along the Rhône, so you can grab a seat on one of the boats or along the pier and enjoy an afternoon treat or coffee!The Saône RiverThe other river in Lyon, the Saône brings the culture and classiness to the city. Along this river are a variety of fancy cafes and restaurants. Be prepared to spend a little more for a meal on this side of town, but a walk along the river is free and breathtaking.NightlifeCome nighttime and those boats along the Rhône turn on the disco lights and pump up the music. Dancing the night away on a disco party boat in Lyon is just something you gotta add to your to-do list, as it is one of the best places to party in Lyon!Traditional Lyonnaise FoodLyonnaise food is a distinctive feature in their long-standing culture, so whether you’re near the Parc de la Tête d’Or, or along the Rhône or the Saône, keep your eyes peeled for some of these top traditional foods at a restaurant or cafe:Gateau de Foie – Liver Pâté CakeCochonnailles – a dish made from pig, including the tongue and feet that tastes better than it sounds!Cervelle de Canut – Cheese with Garlic and HerbsPraline pie – Just yum!Gras double – Tripe Cooked with OnionsSalade Lyonnais – Warm Bacon and Egg SaladDo you have any tips for visiting Lyon?

https://theblondeabroad.com/five-reasons-france-is-the-perfect-place-to-picnic/,Five Reasons France is the Perfect Place to Picnic,France,"Whether you’re a budget backpacker or taking a luxury trip to Paris, do as the French do and enjoy a picnic!A picnic is a universal way to dine out. The ingredients are simple: food, good company, and a nice patch of green grass. Here are five reasons France is the perfect place to picnic! 1. Green Park Spaces are Never in Short SupplyNo matter if you’re in a big city or a small village, France will be sure to have a beautiful green park space. This is the perfect environment for picnicking, and that uniquely vibrant French culture provides the perfect backdrop.Whether you’re searching for a picnic table or a nice patch of green grass to throw a blanket down on, you’ll find an ideal place no matter where you are in France.So you can sit back, relax, and picnic!2. Delicious, Fresh Bread Can Be Found at Any BoulangerieIf there is one thing the French know how to do well (and there are many!), it’s bread. Bread for breakfast, bread for lunch, bread with dinner and bread for a picnic.French bread is warm, fresh, and unbeatable in taste when bought from a quaint boulangerie. These delightful little shops are generally located right next to a supermarket in cities and villages.You’ll be super impressed when you hand over a euro and receive a baguette fresh from the oven with exceptional taste and texture.Doesn’t get much better than that!3. A Quality Bottle of Wine Can Be Bought at the SupermarketWine, wine, wine. A good bottle of this charming drink will not be hard to find. The supermarket aisles are laden with rows and shelves of tasty wine.And in this country, a low price does not mean low quality.That’s the major benefit to picnicking in a country filled with some of the world’s best vineyards. Another great positive is that drinking in public places is legal in France, so it’s perfectly acceptable to pop open a cork and pour some tasty wine during your afternoon picnic.After all, what good are bread and cheese if a drink of wine does not complement it?4. You’ll Be Spoiled for Choice on Amazing Types of CheeseSpeaking of cheese to accompany some wine, you’ll struggle to believe your eyes when you stand in front of the cheese section at a French supermarket. Even in smaller villages, cheese will be a dominant feature of any grocery store.Camembert, Brie, blue cheese, goats cheese, it starts to sound like a Dr. Seuss riddle, but these are really just a few of the options available in France.Once you’ve got that baguette, you’ll need plenty of cheese to lather on it! So grab a few different kinds of cheese to take to the picnic!5. Speculoos Spread and Biscuits for Dessert Won’t DisappointSomething sweet will be on the picnic menu after eating all that cheese (you’ll probably have another bottle of wine ready to go with dessert once you realize how delightful a 1 euro bottle really is).A classic French dessert that is suitable for any type of picnic is delicious biscuits called Speculoos. This treat has a caramelized biscotti flavor and can be enjoyed in biscuit form or in a spread to put on some bread (if you haven’t finished that baguette yet).Speculoos in any form is a real winner for the sweet tooth and will leave your taste buds wanting more and lucky for you the French supermarkets won’t run out of Speculoos any time soon!So, if France is on your itinerary, make sure you add a picnic to your list of things to do. You won’t regret it, nor will you forget the awesome memories made under the French skies as you picnic your afternoon away!Do you have any tips for planning a picnic in France?

https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-medieval-citadel-bonifacio/,Exploring the Medieval Citadel of Bonifacio,France,"On a sailing trip to the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, we dropped anchor in the port of Bonifacio on the island of Corsica. I instantly fell in love with Bonifacio’s French culture, stunning scenery and medieval architecture.We spent the first part of our stay exploring the port town situated right on the water. We sipped on French rosé, cooled off with pistachio gelato and admired the relaxed atmosphere of the small seaside town.Yet, Bonifacio still had so much to offer!Bonifacio is split into 2 parts: the seaside port town and a medieval citadel perched high upon the cliffs overlooking the turquoise Mediterranean. We boarded the town’s train (that looked more like a toy or an amusement park ride) in the marina and made our way up to the citadel.We were immediately enchanted by the labyrinth of narrow streets which were only wide enough for a motorbike. Clotheslines and tiny blue and white flags stitched together historic buildings with sun-bleached doors that held secrets of their inhabitants from long ago.Hand painted wooden signs led us through the web of passageways to brasseries where flower boxes sat below window panes filled with treats and French delicacies.It was like something out of a fairytale.We eventually made our way to the walkway that traced the line of buildings sitting along the cliffside. Our stomachs were grumbling from the smell of fresh food when we looked straight through a door and out to the most jaw-dropping vista I’ve ever seen.A chalkboard was hung by the entrance and featured the daily specials. I was sold on the view, but the sound of warm herbed goat’s cheese on toast and a fresh salad had me running to get a table on the balcony.It was one of the best dining experiences in all of my travels.We licked out plates clean, took another 100 pictures of the view and made our way to one of Bonifacio’s highlights: the King Aragon steps, which were once used to carry water to the citadel. For only 2.50 euros, visitors and walk the 187 steps down from the town to the seaside.We spent the next hour or so walking along the passageway carved from the limestone. At the end of the walk, we were rewarded with a beautiful secluded entrance to the ocean.While beautiful, the climb is not for the faint of heart!The stairs are carved at a 45° incline and, on a hot summer’s day, had us stopping to catch our breath (a few times) on the way back up!We filled the rest of our day with sightseeing around the Old Town tucked inside the Citadel. Several churches and museums transported us back through the history of this modern-day medieval fortress.Our last stop of the day was to the historic air raid shelter. A tunnel was dug by hand leading to a “blockhaus” in the cliffside which would allow military to survey the straits and protect the port of Bonifacio. We climbed down the stairs and into the damp, dark tunnel to the protected area that opened up to a beautiful view of the ocean and the nearby island of Sardinia.Upon re-emerging from the tunnel, we noticed Bonifacio’s Marine Cemetery. The incredibly ornate mausoleums and tombs decorated the cliffside in a sad, yet beautiful, way.We boarded the train back down to the marina and ended our last night with a fabulous dinner and a bottle of champagne. The perfect end to our day in Bonifacio."
https://theblondeabroad.com/sailing-port-bonifacio/,Sailing into the Port of Bonifacio,France,"Situated in the French Mediterranean lies the island of Corsica. My friends and I had been sailing from port town to port town on the Italian island of Sardinia, just 12 km south of Corsica.French island of Corsica in the North. Italian island of Sardinia in the South.After crossing the Strait of Bonifacio from Sardinia, we caught a glimpse of Corsica’s southernmost town, Bonifacio. Turquoise sea met limestone cliffs draped in vegetation. The fortress town teetered along the edge atop the cliffs like a topper on a wedding cake.It was one of the grandest entrances to a town I’d ever experienced.After sailing around a bend in the island, the passage narrowed and it truly felt like we were entering the modern-day version of a well-protected fortress. Medieval architecture still remained, yet the glittering harbor was now packed with impressive mega-yachts.It’s no wonder why Bonifacio is one of the most fashionable and chic holiday destinations for the French.We “parked” our catamaran and dinghy’d to the marina. Bonifacio is sort of separated into two parts. The marina town and the stunning citadel that sits atop the cliffs. We decided to enjoy a quintessentially French lunch at L’Emeraude right by the water.The occasion called for some chilled rosé and a colorful assortment of plates.I was still practicing my Italian from our recent sailing in Sardinia and was lost in translation with our French menus. At least my Spanish gave me some clue as to what I was ordering! I ended up with a colorful shrimp salad with grapefruit wedges and smoked salmon. The boys savored foie gras burgers and real “French” fries- pommes frites.We picked up a guide from a local shop, sat for one more refreshing cocktail (we were on holiday, after all) and planned our adventures in Bonifacio.Call me old fashioned, but I always mail postcards home. I don’t know what my parents do with them. But I love the nostalgia of sending a piece of my travels back home.We began our afternoon exploring the shops by the sea. Little boutiques were filled with artisan jewelry and gorgeous fabrics. A pirate themed candy shop easily caught me eye. Oh, my sweet tooth! Barrels were overflowing with chewy, sweet & sour goodies.I suppressed my urge to buy every piece of candy in the shop so I could get my favorite summer treat-pistachio gelato!I couldn’t help but notice the amount of cats napping around town. Comfortable as could be and lying just about wherever their hearts desired. Too cute and so European.It didn’t take long to explore the stretch of shops in the marina, so we boarded the town’s Disneyland-esque train to begin our journey to the top. The train tour gave some background on Bonifacio, albeit in French. So much for that!Luckily, the scenic ride to the top needed no words.An even MORE dreamy “Part 2” to my adventures in Bonifacio…NEXT: Exploring the Medieval Citadel of BonifacioClick below for outfit inspiration from Corsica!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/colorful-in-corsica/,Colorful in Corsica,France,"I just returned from my sailing trip to the islands of Sardinia and Corsica and have a ton of pictures and more than a few stories to share. First up: A travel style post all about the colors of Corsica!I typically try not to shop before a big trip to save money for my travels. Seems like a no-brainer, but it’s hard to resist the temptation of new clothes for a new trip. For this trip, I allowed myself this one purchase: a simple but oh-so-nautical inspired dress.I loved the midriff cutout and summer inspired stripes!Upon arriving to Bonifacio, a charming French port town on the island of Corsica, I just so happened to be dressed in the appropriate color scheme; blue and white flags lined the entire city connecting the rooftops of dilapidated buildings.I spent the day exploring the little shops of Bonifacio and indulged in the colors and flavors of the city. I picked up a few souvenirs (including my old-fashioned tradition of sending a postcard home), then happily sipped a mojito by the seaside and enjoyed a sweet pistachio gelato treat before sunset.               Dress: Forever 21When thinking of “What to Pack” for a trip, consider the climate and the culture. I knew a conservative but cute dress would serve me well on a sailing trip in Europe. It also kept me cool in the extreme humidity of mid-summer in the Mediterranean.I completed my fabulously French look with a pop of lip color!Whatever your travel style is, try playing with bold colors and fun prints to make the most of your wardrobe.Follow Kiersten @TheBlondeAbroad’s board Travel Fashion on Pinterest.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-greece-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Greece on a Budget,Greece,"The birthplace of Western civilization and home to some of the most beautiful beaches on the planet, Greece is truly awe-inspiring. Whether you are looking to soak in the sun, explore ruins of the past, or party the night away, this is easily one of the top spots in Europe.But it comes at a pretty penny.While places like Santorini and Mykonos can seriously set you back, it’s totally possible to see the best of Greece without breaking the bank.So, grab your flip flops and camera, and let’s look at the top tips for traveling Greece on a budget.  Where to StayUnlike most countries, in Greece, you will actually find decent prices in the bigger cities. Staying in Athens and Thessaloniki will give you some of the cheapest accommodations in the country. If you opt for a hostel dorm room, you can snag a spot for under $20 a night.Once you start looking at hotels on the islands, prices will rise considerably. If you come prepared to stay in a bare-boned hostel, you can still make it happen for around 20 per night if you book in advance.Hostelworld is a great resource when looking for budget accommodations.When to GoLike most places in Europe, the so-called “shoulder” season is the best time to visit. Traveling to Greece in May to June or September to early October, you’ll still get nice weather but fewer crowds and better prices.July and August are peak season and the prices are sky-high. The heat and the crowds can get unbearable and, in fact, many of the locals leave town. If you love getting an authentic sense of the culture and mingling with locals, summer isn’t the time to do it.That said, some places do shut down outside of the peak season so you need to plan in advance. Before you book, read my full guide on when to visit Greece.TransportationThere are a few different ways to get around Greece. You’ll find that train and bus services are relatively cheap and convenient for short distances.For longer trips, however, flights are actually surprisingly affordable. Rather than taking a five-hour bus journey, for example, you might be able to grab a short flight for as cheap as $35 and save yourself a lot of time.Using sites like Skyscanner and other money-saving travel resources make traveling around Greece ultra-affordable. Look for airlines like Aegean, Olympic, and RyanAir. You can fly from Athens to some of the best Greek islands in just an hour. Meanwhile, ferries can take up to ten long hours. FerriesOnce you get out to the Greek islands, ferries are a good option. They run regularly and you can opt for an affordable standard ticket since no cabin is needed on their shorts trips.If you decide to take a longer trip on the seas, go for an overnight ferry like the routes that Blue Star Ferries takes. They are half the cost of a speed ferry and it’s easy to get comfortable.  Street  TravelWhen it comes to short trips around town, there are a couple of apps to use. First up, there’s Uber. While Greece doesn’t allow Uber drivers the way that most countries do, you can still use the app to call a normal taxi in Athens.For the rest of Greece, there’s an app called Beat (former Taxibeat) where you can find reviewed drivers. Taxi travel is cheap in Greece and the apps will run around the same price as cabs you can find on the street.If you’re staying in one place for a while, a moped is a great choice. It’s quick, cheap, and the way that many of the locals get around.  Oía, SantoriniWhich IslandsFor a few different reasons, I’d highly recommend getting off the beaten path. Tourist traps are plentiful and a fast way to rack up the costs. You can easily cut 30 percent off your total cost by checking out less popular.Not sure where to go? Check out my quick guide to the best Greek islands at every budget!For a quintessential view of turquoise seas, Oia in Santorini has it all—but keep in mind that this is a bucket list kind of destination! It’s more of a special honeymoon destination than a budget destination.Mykonos is the ultimate party beach destination. While it’s a beautiful spot and far from overrated, it’s the most expensive island in Greece. When it comes to restaurants and hotels, budget options are few and far between. Skip it if you’re looking to save some cash.While the lively Mykonos and romantic Santorini are loved around the world, there are incredible hidden gems that can save you some real money.Move away from the crowd and check out amazing spots like Corfu and Milos. Not only are they relatively less expensive Greek islands, but they will also give you a glimpse into authentic local culture.   Cheap EatsGreece has some of the best food on the planet! As always, street food is a prime way to experience the best grub.You’ll find gyro and souvlaki on pretty much every corner. “Gyro” means any meat that’s been cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Usually, it’ll be chicken or pork wrapped up in a pita alongside tomatoes, onions, and fries. Souvlaki is skewered meat with a few vegetables sometimes thrown in. Neither of these greasy treats will set you back more than €2.50.One of my fave treats is the spanakopita pastry. You will find these spinach and feta delights at bakeries all over town for around $2.And that’s just the tip of the iceberg! Here are my top ten local foods to try in Greece. Inspired to go on a dream Mediterranean escape? Here’s my ultimate guide to Greece travel. "

With a history dating back to 5 BC, the capital city of Greece is one of Europe’s great historical centers. There is just SO much for any history buff to take in.Wander the Acropolis, Parthenon, and other breathtaking archeological sites to soak it all in.I always recommend checking to see if there is are walking tours of any new city you visit, and Athens is no exception. The tour I took lasted over three hours and took us to all of the archeological sites in Athens. It was definitely the best way to get to know the city.Three days to explore Athens is perfect and you could even see the key points within 48 hours. It is a gorgeous city but you’ll want ample time to explore the islands.Before you go, hit up the Monastiraki Flea Market.

Check out all the pretty as a postcard views of Santorini in these photos!Read More:5 Romantic Places for Couples in SantoriniStaying at the Andronis Arcardia in SantoriniStaying at the Andronis Boutique Hotel in Santorini  Knossos at CreteCreteGreece’s largest island, Crete is one of the islands farthest from the mainland. For this reason, it tends to get fewer visitors. BUT this place has a lot to offer, especially if you have time to explore the vast terrain of this dynamic island.Renowned as the birthplace of Zeus, Crete is a top pick for history and Greek mythology lovers.CorfuIf you are looking for a luxury getaway, Corfu is the island for you. There are gorgeous resorts and villas dotting the coastline that has everything you’ve ever dreamt of.For a honeymoon or girlfriend getaway, look no further.Corfu is a prime choice for culture vultures too. Having been under Venetian, French, and British rule, the island has developed a unique culture. If you love luxe resorts but also like to explore the local scene, this is the Greek island for you.  Ruins of Temple of Apollo NaxosThe group of islands called the Cyclades are home to some of the key Greek archaeological ruins and places of mythological lore. Located in the Aegean Sea, Naxos is the biggest islands of the Cyclades are it’s got some amazing beaches.If you love water sports, this is an especially good spot. It gets more wind than other Greek islands so windsurfing, kitesurfing, and plain old surfing are popular here. You’ll find a selection of schools that’ll help you get going on the water.RhodesNear Turkey in the southeastern Aegean Sea, you’ll find the stunning Dodecanese islands. Rhodes is the biggest of these islands and it’s one of the top picks for a spring or autumn trip. While much of Europe, most of Greece included, is chilly, Rhodes is warm from early April until well into November so you can enjoy some sun during the continent’s off-season.Another top pick for history lovers, this island is home to the Colossus of Rhodes. One of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, this is a must-see.  HydraOne of the Greek Saronic Islands, Hydra is in the Aegean Sea nestled between the Myrtoan Sea and the Argolic Gulf. You might have seen this island as the backdrop of more than a few movies and it remains a place loved by jetsetters. Celebs from around the world own homes here and it’s a good place for stargazing.This is no LA though! In fact, cars are banned in Hydra so you’re more likely to see locals getting around by donkey than Ferrari.I had an amazing time sailing the Saronic Islands in Greece, and I’d highly recommend taking your time getting around.     KosAnother of Greece’s renowned Dodecanese islands, Kos is a tourist fave. Dotted with fascinating Greek and Roman ruins, this island has no shortage of lush sandy beaches.Of course, there is no shortage of all-inclusive resorts that can offer a little slice of heaven. Kos is definitely a place to consider for a chill beach break.IosOne of the Cyclades, Ios is the Ibiza of Greece. If you are on a quest for a non-stop party in the Greek Isles, they’ve got you covered. From the start of June until the end of August, Europeans in their 20s descend on Ios looking to live it up.Once you’ve worked up an appetite, here are the ten local foods you have got to try in Greece.   ParosParo is the hub for visiting the Cyclades and it tends to be pretty touristy in July and August, though still worth checking out. When the island really shines, however, is during the off-season.While many of the Greek islands shutter up outside of summer, Paros has a thriving year-round population so it’s life, as usual, all year.The locals (often ex-pats who have adopted Paros as home) create a more traditional vibe in the small villages of the island so it is a good place to experience Greece.For a look at the whole year, check out the best time to travel to Greece.  IthacaOne of the hidden gems of the Aegean Sea, Ithaca is your Greek island if you are looking to get away from the hustle and bustle that you will find in other spots during the peak seasons.Visiting Ithaca definitely does require a few connections but it’s worth it in the end. This mountainous isle has flawless and often deserted beaches.SkiathosIf you’ve seen Mamma Mia, you’ll recognize Skiathos straight away. And this beautiful island is more than just a movie set! Famous for its beaches and party scene, this is another top pick for the younger crowd looking for a wild ride.Which Greek Islands have you been to and which would you recommend?

It’s the largest island of the circular archipelago hence the reason most people choose to call it Santorini!While islands like Mykonos are known for their parties, Santorini is much more laid back.In fact, it’s the perfect island for couples and honeymooners looking for a romantic getaway. Watch the sunset with your significant other, walk around Fira, shop till you drop in Oía, or just catch some sun on Perissa Beach for an unforgettable time.My recent trip to Greece, complete with a stay at the Andronis Boutique Hotel and Andronis Arcadia, was an absolute dream and after having not visited in over 5+ years. I love Mykonos and all its wild ways but Santorini is where it’s at for a romantic getaway.Truth be told, most of those iconic photos you see of Greece are actually of the town of Oiá in Santorini!If you are looking for the best time to travel to Greece, I highly recommend visiting during offseason which is during the fall (late September to November) or late spring (May), right before summer begins. This will help you avoid the 4.5 million tourists that flock to the small island while still allowing you to soak up the incredible weather.You can truly see almost everything on the island in 2-3 days (it’s a pretty small place!) so I highly recommend it as a stop along the way as you island-hop your way through Greece.Have you ever been to Greece?

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-the-andronis-arcardia-in-santorini/,Staying at the Andronis Arcardia in Santorini,Greece,"During my most recent trip around Greece and the Mediterranean, staying in Oía on Santorini was my TOP priority! I have been wanting to visit since The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants days…and I can imagine it might be the same for some of you!Just like the Andronis Boutique Hotel that I stayed at, the Andronis Arcadia is located in Oía, and it’s just as pretty as postcards make it out to be.Although it just opened this past June, there are some kinks the hotel needs to work out. That said, it’s a beautiful property comprised of nothing but suites, unforgettable views, and a fun party atmosphere.If you’re looking for a taste of Mykonos while in Santorini—as in those cool party vibes—you’ll find that at Andronis Arcadia.Here’s what it is like to stay at Andronis Arcadia!    Getting ThereGetting to Santorini is pretty simple! You can either choose to fly directly into the airport (Santorini National Airport), or you can take a ferry if you decide to island-hop.Once you arrive in Santorini, it’s about a 25-minute taxi ride to Oía, which costs about 55€ per vehicle. So just keep that in mind!The hotel also provides airport transportation—so contact their concierge to arrange for this! About the PropertyWhen most people think of Santorini, they think of crisp white buildings and incredible views. The Andronis is quite different and might have you feeling like you’re in Mykonos instead. The property definitely has more brown hues and an overall sort of desert vibe.One draw is that you’re only about a 5-minute walk to those picturesque cliffs Oía is known for!Andronis Arcadia aims to bring a fun pool area and live tropical house music to Santorini—drawing in a younger crowd. If you’re looking for a party in Santorini, this might be the ideal place for you!    The RoomsThere are 6 different room types at the Andronis Arcadia. The Four-Bedroom Villa, Two-Bedroom Villa, Executive Suite, Sunset Suite, Eden Villa, and the Family Suite. No matter which one you choose, you have access to a private pool, a modern bathroom, and a contemporary sitting room. All the rooms are pretty basic but they get the job done!I stayed in the Sunset Suite and it was complete with a master bedroom, large bathroom, and a private infinity pool. It had just enough for me and Meyer.The one thing I did enjoy about the property is that they use local and natural products! DiningThe breakfast here is phenomenal! They bring out a platter of local pastries and traditional breakfast goodies and a tray of butter and different preserves along with honey.Then a waitress comes around with a Greek yogurt cart and you have the option of a chia seed yogurt or full cream Greek yogurt and an array of toppings—fresh fruit, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, Brazil nuts, macadamia nuts—you name it!   I loved this!You can also order off a two-page breakfast menu that has so many juices and it’s included in your stay. I’m alllllll about a good breakfast menu!OpsonOpson prepares traditional Greek dishes, inspired by meals enjoyed by philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Omiros. Using fresh vegetables from the kitchen’s garden and other local delicacies, the menu is a contemporary spin on dishes like eel, trout, calamari, and lentils.  Oishii Sushi BarOishii Sushi BarThis open-air sushi bar features the infinity pool and the Aegean Sea as a backdrop was my favorite restaurant on property. The menu includes classic rolls such as spicy tuna, salmon avocado, and crab rolls along with special rolls like shrimp tempura and Peruvian rolls.AltheaIf you’re a seafood lover, Althea will have you falling in love at first bite. It’s all about traditional Mediterranean delights here! The Pool & SpaA visit to the Evexia is a sure-fire way to escape the non-stop party and get your relaxation on. During our stay, we opted for the ‘Couples Connect’ experience and the spa treatment was absolutely phenomenal.Scrub, massage, and sound healing? Yes, PLEASE!!There are multiple options for massages, therapies, and facials. There’s also a steam room and a sauna, along with a gym.  Their infinity pool was also incredible and during the summer you have FANTASTIC views of the sunset. Most of the other hotels in Oía have an obstructed view of the sunset, so you have to wander around to get a clear view, but at Andronis Arcadia, you can watch the sunset from the pool!Even if you aren’t staying at Andronis Arcadia, I would highly recommend heading to their pool and bar for sunset as they often have DJs and live music. The day we were leaving they had Jimmy Sax coming to perform, so they’re definitely wanting to bring the party and crowds! ActivitiesHotel Live MusicLooking to chill out by the pool or get your party on? Then this is definitely the place!Catamaran SailingWhat better way to see the Aegean than to sail it by catamaran? The boat stops by all major sites, including the Hot Springs and ends with a delicious BBQ with local wine as the sunsets.Scuba DivingGreece has some of the best scuba diving in the world so if you’re anything like me, I highly recommend exploring the underwater world of Santorini. The geology and volcanic activity have created an unbelievable home for some beautiful sea creatures.Wine AdventureWhat would a trip to Greece be without a wine tour? The Santorini Wine Company offers a wide variety of wine and gastronomy tours where you can learn about the soil, the microclimate, and the techniques used to make Greek wine so special.  Santorini Walking TourIf you’re looking to explore Santorini like a local, I highly suggest taking a walking tour through the villages. You get to explore hidden gems that many don’t know about, walk along ancient cobblestone streets, and take in every ounce of scenery that Santorini has to offer.Helicopter FlightTaking a helicopter tour lets you see Greece from a whole new point of view. Fly over famous islands like Mykonos, Crete, and Rhodes, and the fascinating capital of Athens for a once in a lifetime experience.Photo SafariIf you’ve been following my blog or Instagram then you know that I am a big fan of photo safaris. The semi-private photo tour lets you explore new spots of Santorini while improving your photography skills. In My OpinionOverall, it’s a very non-typical Santorini property. Social events by the pool are what this place aims to be known for, so if you’re looking for more of a party vibe and you want to meet others, you might just love this place!Since the property had only been opened for a month, it’s understandable that they are still getting things up and running. I will say that customer service was unfortunately subpar… It seemed to me that the staff (aside from those working at the spa) was a little too cool, and not attentive at all.However, their goal is to improve as much as possible in the coming weeks and get live music playing at sunset several times a month.If you’re looking for the typical Oía experience whilst in Santorini, this place probably isn’t for you. But if you’re into more of a party scene and looking for a fun environment, it might be your cup of tea! Then again, if you’re looking for parties—you might just want to head to Mykonos.Also, it’s probably better if you’re traveling in a group, rather than going here for a romantic holiday!

If not, you can fly directly into Santorini National Airport.The journey to Oía is a quick 25-minute drive from the airport if you take a taxi.

If you’re looking to save a little extra money, there are shuttle buses that will cost you 15€ per person.Contact the concierge at Andronis Boutique Hotel to arrange airport or port transfer for you!  About the PropertyNo matter where you turn, the Andronis Boutique Hotel offers stunning views of the Aegean and it’s quite a hot spot for honeymooners.

Yes, please, always!!  Andronis Boutique Hotel  The RoomsThe layout of the hotel ensures that all suites are completely private. Every room has a view and every room is different.Talk about dreamy!The 23 cave-like suites all have their own private entrance, living rooms, secluded balconies with sweeping views, king-sized beds, walk-in rain showers, and a private jacuzzi. I was especially fond of the aesthetic—crisp white walls and minimalistic décor.I stayed in several rooms just to get an idea of the property. I started in the 2 Bedroom Villa which would be great for families. I then moved onto the Elegant Suite which was the perfect romantic hideaway.I also thought the Pool Suites, the Water Retreat, and the Cave Pool Suite were absolutely breathtaking. You truly can’t go wrong with the suites at the Andronis. In case you’re wondering, these photos are from a Normal Suite (yes, that’s the Normal Suite!!).Note: This property does not accommodate children due to its construction on the cliff and no facilities for little ones. They even had a card for custom pillow selection, which I thought was an especially sweet touch!DiningBreakfast is included in your stay, so believe me—I sampled a ton of the local honeycomb! Aside from breakfast, I was particularly in love with…and in awe of Lauda Restaurant.   Lauda RestaurantWhile fine dining in highly touristic locations like Santorini doesn’t always present you with a ton of “local culture,” Lauda is different! It was actually the first restaurant on Santorini—back when only about 300 people inhabited the island. Can you imagine that?Lauda was built in 1971 and was Oia’s first restaurant. It’s where all of the locals gathered to talk and drink (and use the village’s only phone!).One of my favorite things about this place is to honor their history and the tradition of the island, they use local, fully-organic ingredients to serve up an insanely delicious tasting menu.I tried the Discovery Menu, aka the 9-course dinner, and was truly blown away.Some of my favorites included the sea urchin and the yellowtail with seaweed. I substituted the lamb for fish (which they so gracefully allowed) and it hit the spot. I would definitely recommend eating here even if you choose to stay elsewhere as it is quite the experience.  Above is uni with coffee and then Greek yogurt with spoon sweets—which is similar to a sour cherry. So delicious!We loved the Greek yogurt with spoon sweets so much we actually ordered it to our room (it’s not even on the menu but again, their customer service is amazing!!).They also have a water flavoring tray with slices of lemon, lime, and cucumber. All about those fresh goodies!The Pool & SpaThe gym and spa are located at this sister property—Andronis Arcadia, but it’s not a far walk at all (about ten minutes or so!).Alternatively, the pools at Andronis Boutique Hotel are heavenly and you definitely don’t want to miss out!The pool was the ideal temperature for the summer in Santorini. It was cool but quite refreshing and I spent my fair share of time hanging out in and around it. 🙂ActivitiesCatamaran SailingWhat better way to see the Aegean than to sail it by catamaran? The boat stops by all major sites, including the Hot Springs and ends with a delicious BBQ with local wine as the sunsets.Scuba DivingGreece has some of the best scuba diving in the world so if you’re anything like me, I highly recommend exploring the underwater world of Santorini. The geology and volcanic activity have created an unbelievable home for some beautiful sea creatures.Wine AdventureWhat would a trip to Greece be without a wine tour? The Santorini Wine Company offers a wide variety of wine and gastronomy tours where you can learn about the soil, the microclimate, and the techniques used to make Greek wine so special.  Santorini Walking TourIf you’re looking to explore Santorini like a local, I highly suggest taking a walking tour through the villages. You get to explore hidden gems that many don’t know about, walk along ancient cobblestone streets, and take in every ounce of scenery that Santorini has to offer.Helicopter FlightTaking a helicopter tour lets you see Greece from a whole new point of view. Fly over famous islands like Mykonos, Crete, and Rhodes, and the fascinating capital of Athens for a once in a lifetime experience.Photo SafariIf you’ve been following my blog or Instagram then you know that I am a big fan of photo safaris. The semi-private photo tour lets you explore new spots of Santorini while improving your photography skills.In My OpinionOverall, I absolutely loved staying at Andronis Boutique Hotel—in my mind, it was the definition of an ideal boutique hotel. I would 1000% stay here again…and again.I was blown away by the views, the private suites, and the top-notch customer service. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Santorini.Even if you don’t stay here, take a walk around the property and prepare to fall in love!More InformationHotel: Andronis Boutique HotelLocation: Oía, Santorini, GreeceAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$ Thank you to Andronis Boutique Hotel for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-the-myconian-collection-in-mykonos/,Staying at the Myconian Collection in Mykonos,Greece,"I recently ventured to Greece to meet up with my boyfriend, Meyer, and kick-off a month of European travels! We began our adventure in Mykonos to enjoy some R&R and soak up the Mediterranean sunshine.I hadn’t been back to Mykonos in nearly a decade so it was really exciting to return!The Myconian Collection is a family-owned group of 10 luxury hotels in Mykonos and, during our visit, we were lucky enough to stay at two of them.Talk about serious views, gourmet restaurants, insane swimming pools, a welcoming staff… and did I mention the insane swimming pools?!Because when in Mykonos, right?Here’s what it is like to stay at Myconian Collection’s Korali Relais & Châteaux and Villa Collection!  Mykonos, GreeceGetting ThereRegardless of which property you choose, you can fly to Mykonos or take the ferry if you’re island hopping. The Villa Collection also has helicopter transfers!We didn’t make use of this, but it sounds so cool…guess we’ll just have to go back. 😉The Villa Collection is located on the hillside above Elia Beach (about 25 minutes from Mykonos Town) and the Korali is located just outside of Mykonos Town.Elia Beach is definitely a bit further out so keep that in mind when booking, but the panoramic views can’t be beaten. Korali is better if you’re looking for that bustling city vibe!One of the best parts of these properties is the ability to rent an ATV! If you’re staying for a long period of time, this can be extremely useful since the island is so big and there’s a lot of ground to cover.  About the PropertiesVilla CollectionThe Villa Collection is the definition of luxury with spacious rooms, suites, and villas, complemented by 5-star service around the clock. There’s a large entertainment deck with a bar, giving you panoramic views of the sea, a gourmet restaurant, a world-class spa, a fine-sand beach, and a saltwater infinity pool.Korali Relais & ChâteauxKorali is the hot spot if you care less about views and more about being around the alluring city life of Mykonos Town.The luxurious rooms are complete with shaded balconies and oversized pools or jacuzzis. The bar on property, Kitrino, is the perfect place to sip on a cocktail before hitting the town to soak up the nightlife. And its restaurant, Baos, offers a fine dining experience with the views, so you don’t have to give up the scenery too much.P.S. To keep things simpler, I’ll be referring to this one as Korali for the rest of the post! The Rooms  Villa CollectionDon’t let the idea of a standard room fool you when it comes to the Villa Collection. The rooms are the epitome of luxury with pure white interiors, designer pieces, vibrant fabrics, expansive terraces, and infinity pools. Both the Prestige and Exclusive rooms sleep up to 3 and offer incredible views.Suites and VillasAs you move up to suites and villas, the rooms become larger, perfect for families or couples who enjoy an abundance of space. Whether you’re a newlywed looking to stay in the Lovers Suite (complete with a private infinity pool) or you’re traveling with girlfriends and looking to stay in the Exclusive Villa (which sleeps up to 6), there’s an option for every traveler.Unique VillasWant 24/7 service, personalized spa treatments, catered dinners, and even butler service? That’s where the unique villas come in. The villas can sleep anywhere from 6 to 14 people and they all offer something different. Check out their site for more details on what makes each villa uniquely it’s own.   KoraliUnlike the Villa Collection, the Korali only has rooms and suites but don’t let that deter you. There are 15 different options, all sleeping 2-3 people and still offering luxurious touches. Planning a trip to Greece?  Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');   Myconian Villa CollectionDiningVilla CollectionThe location for the Villa Collection is a major bonus as you get ocean views no matter where you sit to eat! And, we thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. Honestly, their breakfast was probably one of the best hotel buffets I’ve ever had!They had a whole area dedicated to local produce and products, which I really loved.Oh, and they had a Bloody Mary bar—how cool is that?!I also adored the aesthetic of the restaurant! There are pink velvet pool chairs and the dining room is a dusty rose color…so it’s pretty easy on the eyes!  Cabbanes at The Villa CollectionThis poolside à-la-carte restaurant offers gourmet meals prepared by Thodoris Kyriakidis, who trained at Michelin-starred restaurants such as One Lombard Street. Pulling inspiration from France and Italy, a unique Greek menu has been put together for your enjoyment.We had dinner here at sunset one night and 10/10 recommend the experience!Pair your dinner with a local Greek wine from Cabbanes’ extensive list for an unforgettable dining experience.Infinity Pool Bar at The Villa CollectionThe Infinity Pool Bar is a great place to get light bites such as salads, oysters, sea urchins, or caviar. All of these quick snacks pair phenomenally with their cocktails, smoothies, or champagne. If you visit during the summer, you might find a DJ playing live music in the evenings.  Korali Relais & ChâteauxKoraliWe didn’t end up eating at any of the restaurants at Korali and rather went into Mykonos Town for dinner. However, if you are staying on the property to dine, make sure to check out Baos!BaosBaos serves traditional Greek dishes with a contemporary flair, using local seafood and farm produce. The main dishes include plates such as orzo, braised short ribs, lobster, and lamb. Though I was unable to experience it, I’ve heard nothing but amazing things about the food as well as the service.The PoolsVilla CollectionAh yes, my favorite part of these hotels! The saltwater infinity pool will leave you breathless the minute you see it.If you’re willing to splurge, I highly recommend getting a villa with a private pool, especially if visiting with a significant other. We had a room with a jacuzzi and while it was sooo lovely, I would definitely spring for the pool villa next time.Talk about romantic!   The staff at the Villa Collection also walks around the pool with complimentary skincare and SPF products from their spa. Such a nice touch instead of having to go back to the room to apply!  KoraliThe pool at the Korali is much more relaxed, with large yellow sofas and loungers. Music is constantly playing from the vibrant bar and the party keeps going all day. Make sure to grab a cold beverage as you soak up that Mykonos sunshine!Order the frozen strawberry juice. Thank me later!   ActivitiesVilla CollectionAlong with the most incredible infinity pool of my life, the Villa Collection has private sunbeds set up on Elia Beach, reserved exclusively for hotel guests. While you’re lounging by the water, you also have the chance to go kayaking, windsurfing, waterskiing, parasailing, wakeboarding, along with scuba diving (my favorite!).And don’t worry about getting from the top of the hill to the bottom. The resort offers a complimentary beach shuttle so you won’t have to do too much climbing!If you would rather stay indoors and get your zen on, the Rejuvenation Spa is an oasis of tranquility. You can spoil yourself with a Hawaiian Wave Massage, a Superfood Pro-Radiance Facial, or a Chill Out body massage with warm shells.KoraliKorali also has a spa where you can unwind with essential oils and a hydro-massage or a traditional massage that will help you detox after a night out on the town. It’s definitely worth looking into the Frangipani Lovers package, an interactive experience of the senses.But before heading to the spa, don’t forget to check out the yoga or pilates classes offered. With on-site coaches, there are instructors for every skill level.Or if you don’t feel like working out but want to exercise the brain, attend a unique wellness seminar or take a personal coaching session where you’ll learn about stress-relief, resilience building, and holistic nutrition.In My OpinionOverall, the Villa Collection in Elia Beach is ideal those that want more of a romantic getaway with the most breathtaking views! Though it is about 25-30 minutes outside of the main city, the shuttle buses to Mykonos Town make it easy to get around.If you’re wanting to be closer to town, Korali is the place for you. It’s within walking distance of Mykonos Town, so if you want to be closer to the action—stay here!One of my favorite things is that if you’re staying at any of the Myconian properties, you are free to wander and enjoy the amenities at each hotel. So, if you want to use the adults-only pool at a different Myconian property than the one you’re staying at, no worries!You aren’t limited to just what’s at the place you’re staying. Pretty cool, right?Regardless of the property, you’ll experience luxurious touches, some of the tastiest dishes (EVER!), great customer service, and the friendliest staff!  More InformationHotel: Villa CollectionLocation: Elia Beach, Mykonos, GreeceAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$ More InformationHotel: Korali Relais & ChâteauxLocation: Mykonos Town, Mykonos, GreeceAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$ Thank you to Myconian Collection for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-sailing-the-saronic-islands-in-greece/,Tips for Sailing the Saronic Islands in Greece,Greece,"When sailing around Greece, you’ll find secluded coves, chic bars and restaurants, and all the tzatziki you could possibly imagine. I sailed the Saronic Islands with The Yacht Week Greece and fell in love.With so many islands to explore, sailing is the best way to make the most of your trip. Here are my tips for sailing the Saronic Islands in Greece!Day 1: AlimosAlimos Marina is the largest of the marinas in Greece. Located about 9 miles southwest of downtown Athens, this is where you are most likely to board any sailing boat or yacht that you are going to take around the islands of Greece!Day 2: ErimioniErimioni is a small own of Peloponnese. Its tourism has seen a boom in recent years due to many summer houses being built in the area.If you feel like a little R&R, take a walk around the cobblestone alleys and the whitewashed homes. You’ll also find plenty of traditional coffeehouses (kafeneia) and little taverns to enjoy a glass of wine.Day 3: SpetsesSpetses is known for its old harbor and Dapia, a commercial center where all the entertainment happens. Here you can take a romantic horse-drawn carriage around the island or visit some of the historical naval spots like the House of Bouboulina or the House of Hatzigiannis Mexis. If you’re looking for a little more adventure, rent an ATV and see the island on wheels.Day 4: Porto HeliOut of all the destinations, Porto Heli is known as one the most famous and most luxurious. We’re talking luxury brands alongside white sand beaches and world class food.It’s very similar to the Amalfi Coast without the flocks of tourists. If you’re looking to see some of the hottest beach parties in Greece, look no further.Nikki Beach in Porto Heli is world famous for its beach party scene. In fact “Niki” in Greece means “victory.” The resorts have infinity pools and DJs that play music that will draw you in.Day 5: Natural Bay on DokosDokos is one of the most isolated islands in the Saronic Gulf. In fact, the island has a population of about only 50 people.The best way to see the island is to hop on a bicycle and explore. After you’ve worked up an appetite, stop the Old Olive Press Taverna for local produce and drinks.Day 6: HydraHydra is one of the more the laid-back Greek islands. The island is only 50 kilometers square and you won’t find any cars or motor vehicles.In fact, the only way to get around is by donkeys and water taxis.Spend your day soaking in the architecture and colorful bougainvillea that line the alleyways. The port itself has crystal clear water and many of the nearby beaches are often undisturbed.Read More: Tips for Traveling Greece on a BudgetDay 7: AthensDid you know that Athens is the historical capital of Europe? In fact, it dates back to the 5th century BC.Because it’s long history, there are so many incredible archeological sites to visit. Some of the most famous include Acropolis, a site you’ve most likely seen in all of your history books, and the Parthenon.I always recommend checking to see if there is a free walking tour of any new city you visit, and Athens has a great one. The tour I took lasted over 3 hours and took us to all of the archeological sites in Athens. You can also walk the Athens Flea market for cheap souvenir shopping and some fresh fruit to snack on. There are little fruit stands all over selling inexpensive cherries, nectarines and pretty much everything you could imagine!There is so much delicious and authentic Greek food to try in the city so be sure to ask some locals for their recommendations. And don’t leave without trying Greek yogurt with spoon sweets!Read More: What to Do in Athens, Greece in Three DaysWith over 6,000 different islands, sailing is the best way to see and experience the most of Greece in the shortest amount of time!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-go-on-the-yacht-week/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Go on The Yacht Week,Greece,"During my first The Yacht Week, I knew this amazing sailing adventure had to be a yearly tradition. Since my first trip down the Adriatic coastline, I have now been on been aboard these gorgeous yachts in the British Virgin Islands, Greece, Italy, Grenada and Croatia.I’ve been on four all-girls trips on The Yacht Week and it has quickly become one of my fave girlfriend getaways.Not only is it ideal for reconnecting with your girls, it is also a perfect time to meet people from around the globe. I’ve made incredible lasting friendship with so many great people from Canada to Australia and beyond, while creating lasting memories with my besties.Another thing that I love about The Yacht Week is that you can see so many stunning spots without having to deal with all of the logistics. TYW has routes in Montenegro, Italy, Granada, Greece, and Croatia (you can now choose from original Croatian route or the Ultra Festival tour of Croatia).There are so many gorgeous coastlines on every route and being at sea will give you a totally different perspective of the regions.While I love organizing girls’ getaway to see far-flung destinations, it can be a major headache to actually get it all done. I am obsessed with TYW because it makes things so easy.Once you get on board all of your transportation is taken care of and you can see tons of different places while only unpacking once. You don’t have to split the bill all of the time or try to plan things that everybody will like.Expenses are straightforward and everything else is done for you. I’ve always done one big grocery shop before the trip then created a group fund to cover all of the outings.Once that’s all done there’s nothing else to worry about buying during the trip. Once you set sail, you can hang out together with your friends or get out there mingle.This is especially nice in my opinion because it means you can get in some quality time without being attached at the hip 24/7.So, ladies, are you ready to grab your bikinis and get the party started? The only question is which trip to go for?The Yacht Week Croatia was my first TYW experience and it’ll always be a special place for me. This destination is so popular that they have actually created two tour paths now and they’re both worth looking into.The Yacht Week British Virgin Islands was my second trip and it was full of beautiful turquoise waters, sandy beaches and lots of palm trees.I love The Yacht Week Italy because it’s an opportunity to explore Sicily and its unique culture. And the views! The Italian route brings you past some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.For me, The Yacht Week Greece is the most well-balanced route of them all and you’ll get to see and do SO much.I still have Montenegro and Granada on my travel bucket list, so it’s up to you guys to tell me how those are!So what are you waiting for?[button link=”http://bit.ly/2gUfmW3″ color=”lightgray” size=”xlarge” type=”” shape=”” target=”_blank” title=”BOOK THE YACHT WEEK HERE” gradient_colors=”|” gradient_hover_colors=”|” accent_color=”” accent_hover_color=”” bevel_color=”” border_width=”1px” shadow=”{{shadow}}” icon=”” icon_divider=”yes” icon_position=”left” modal=”” animation_type=”0″ animation_direction=”down” animation_speed=”0.1″ alignment=”center” class=”” id=””]BOOK THE YACHT WEEK HERE[/button]"
https://theblondeabroad.com/5-romantic-places-couples-mykonos/,5 Romantic Places for Couples in Mykonos,Greece,"For those of you who are under the impression that Mykonos is nothing more than a party island, you’re in for a nice surprise. Mykonos is GORGEOUS. It is relaxing. It has a very “home-y” feel to it.For those of you traveling to Mykonos with your partner, we know you’ll want to escape the party and the crowds at times. Mykonos has an amazing party scene but that is not the only thing it has to offer.There is much more to Mykonos than the beach parties and night clubs that you see on Instagram.On Mykonos you’ll also find beautiful beaches, friendly locals, delicious food, and a warm culture that seems to captivate travelers.When you need an escape form the beach parties and night clubs, the following locations will be the perfect get away for you and your lover.Here are 5 romantic places for couples in Mykonos!Agios SostisArguably the most gorgeous beach on the island of Mykonos. We had such an incredible experience here basking in the sun, enjoying the beautiful crystal clear blue water, and even indulging in a massage by a local woman who was walking around looking to make money.Agios Sostis was the first recommendation by one of our friends who is from Crete, so it was of course our first adventure on the island. It set the bar pretty high for the week!You’ll want to rent ATVs when you are on Mykonos as they’re the most efficient way to get around the island. Agios Sostis is a bit remote, so have a fun ATV ride with your partner as you cruise across the island!Lia BeachLia Beach is a great spot to get away, lay on a beach chair, and drink a frappe under an umbrella.There is a cute little restaurant near the beach that has an amazing bowl of Greek Yogurt and some delicious frappes (essentially instant iced coffee with foam…trust us, you’ll be drinking these all over Greece).The water at Lia is gorgeous, just like almost every beach on Mykonos, and the rocks surrounding the beach on either side give it an even more secluded vibe. If you venture over the rocks to the left and walk up and over the hill, you’ll find a private beach.Be bold and go nude! It’s the Mykonos way.Little VeniceWhere the western most part of Mykonos Town meets the sea you will find Little Venice. Just simply walking along the sea can be quite romantic and enjoyable for you and your partner but you’re sure to love the food, shops, and people you’ll meet.The buildings are built right up to the waterfront which gives it the vibe of the Venice canals. Historically this architectural design offered the locals the ability to load and off-load goods to/from boats quickly and efficiently.For us, in present day, it just looks beautiful!Agios StefanosWe probably would not have discovered this beach if it wasn’t for the fact that our hostel was on the hill above it. Agios Stefanos is a western facing beach (i.e. perfect for sunset) and is not particularly crowded.You’re sure to enjoy the number of restaurants lining the beach and the opportunity to have a server bring you food and drinks to your chair and umbrella.Being in close proximity (just north) to the Mykonos port, you’ll also be able to watch a number of large cruise ships come in and out of Mykonos.Paraga BeachPraga Beach is a great spot for relaxing, partying, and exploring with your lover. Kalua Beach Bar is an awesome spot to enjoy some drinks on the beach.You can even swim out to the rock that is just off shore and sit in the middle of the bay. Golden hour and sunset from Praga are something you and your partner will definitely love as well…it’s gorgeous over there!If you’re into taking a small hike, you can hike toward Paradise Beach (toward the east) and you’ll enjoy some incredible views of the south side of Mykonos with some incredible cliffs and rocks and breathtaking beaches.Read More about our experience in Greece!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-go-greece/,The Best Time to Travel to Greece,Greece,"Updated: February 2020The quintessential Mediterranean getaway, Greece can be a gorgeous destination any day of the year. From Thessaloniki to Santorini to Mykonos to Athens and beyond, there is so much to see in this historically rich, picture-perfect Mediterranean paradise.Here’s the best time to go to Greece! April to JuneMonths: April to JuneIf I had to choose one definitive best time of year, I would say that the prime time to see Greece is from mid-April to mid-June. You’ve got perfect weather during spring and you are able to enjoy some peace and quiet before the crowds of tourists show up. While it can still be a bit chilly, areas like Crete, the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and the Ionian islands are often warm enough for swimming.Ready for a spring sojourn?Just watch out for Easter week! It’s an incredibly busy time in Greece. Hotels are often fully booked with Greeks traveling around the country and many of the primary tourist attractions are closed so it’s not the most convenient time to try to explore.Read More:Tips for Traveling Greece on a BudgetHelpful Tips for Traveling the Greek IslandsA Quick Guide to the Best Greek Islands to Visit   July to SeptemberI probably don’t need to tell you that summer in Greece is amazing. With weather regularly pushing 90 degrees and nonstop sunshine, it’s heavenly.It’s the best time of year to just lie on the beach and forget about the world.One of Greece’s summer hot spots is Santorini Island where every moment is Instagram worthy. The island is visited by millions every summer. The rich and famous scatter the beaches in the day then party the night away. It’s definitely got something for everyone.Mykonos is also one of Greece’s top spots for lush beaches and insane nightlife. Lie under the hot Greek sun all day and then party until you drop.

Check out the region of Heraklion which has a great mix of cafés, restaurants, beaches, and family-friendly spots.Read More:The Ultimate Mykonos Travel Guide20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit MykonosTips for Sailing the Saronic Islands in Greece October to DecemberWhile we tend to think of Greece as all white sand beaches and endless blue sea, there are some other intensely beautiful colors farther inland. When the leaves start to turn and you can smell that autumn scent in the air, you are ready to explore the other side of Greece.Fall can be just as stunning as summer but in a totally different way.Visit in September when the grapes are being harvested and the world-class vineyards are in full swing. Or wait another month and get your hands on some homemade raki from the street stands of Crete.And let me tell you, fellow foodies, there is no better time or place to eat than October and November in Greece when local olives and other Mediterranean treats are fresh for the taking.Read More:10 Local Foods to Try in Greece     January to MarchLast but certainly not least, winter in Greece is the perfect opportunity to see the country like the locals do. Take in the café culture in Athens while you chat away for hours over a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. When the sun sets, check out the local nightlife.Are you into history?You can visit the suddenly tourist-free Acropolis or the uncrowded, world-famous museums like the National Archaeological Museum and the Benaki Museum. With the endless lines gone and the lower prices, you can see so much more of the city than you ever could have during the summer or spring.While Athens is great during the winter, the islands are a different story. Many ferries stop running and you won’t find a whole lot to do so it’s not worth the trip unless you are searching for your own deserted island.Whichever time of year you decide to visit, I can promise you one thing: you will fall in love. The people, the food, and the breath-taking scenery (maybe even a modern-day Greek god) are sure to steal your heart away! Read More:What to Do in Athens, Greece in Three DaysA Quick Guide to the Best Greek Islands to Visit "
https://theblondeabroad.com/5-romantic-places-couples-santorini/,5 Romantic Places for Couples in Santorini,Greece,"Santorini is essentially a honeymoon island that emanates romance regardless where you are on the island. Having explored the whole of the island, we thought we would share our favorite spots with y’all.Here’s the top romantic places for couples in Santorini!AkrotiriAkrotiri is one of the most under-appreciated areas on the island of Santorini. Oia and Fira are much more common destinations for travelers, but we absolutely loved Akrotiri!It’s positioned on the southern tip of the island so you have an incredible view of the volcano and the entire west coast of Santorini. Hotels are cheaper and locals are incredibly friendly.Check out Akrotiri while you’re here for an awesome, romantic experience!Oia for SunsetWhen you see images of Santorini there is a fairly good chance that they were captured in Oia. Oia is the most famous town on the Island and is renowned for its gorgeous buildings, incredible panoramic views, delicious Greek food, and of course the famous sunset of Oia.The famous sunset of Oia is arguably one of the most coveted parts of Santorini. Get to the edge of Oia and enjoy a romantic sunset with your partner.Word of advice: get there early! It gets SUPER crowded around sunset.It gets SUPER crowded in Oia around sunset. There are a number of spots you’ll find at the northernmost part of Oia that give you a great view for sunset.If you’re struggling to find one, just look for where all the crowds are and you will be in the right spot. Then, adventure around and find a more private area for you and your partner to watch the sunset.Read More: 20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit SantoriniRed BeachHave you ever seen a red sand beach? The famous Red Sand beach of Santorini is will blow your mind and definitely set the mood for you and your lover. The massive red cliff and red sand are nothing like you’ve ever seen in the world and the water is gorgeous!Everything about our trip to Red Beach was like a dream. We rode in on our ATVs, parked, and then had to take a very short, walk/hike down to Red Beach. When you get to the lookout over the beach your jaw will most likely drop.You can enjoy this view and perhaps have a quick picnic here, or you can head down to the beach with your partner and enjoy one of the most unique beaches in the world.ImerovigliSimilar to Akrotiri, Imerovigli is a bit under appreciated. The town is a perfect sunset viewing destination, yet most travelers aren’t familiar enough with the area to know that. Walk through the town and find a nice rooftop or lookout for the sunset while you enjoy an awesome view of the Caldera.The local vibe here is awesome and the lack of a crowd makes the romance that much stronger.Hiking Trail Between Fira & OiaHiking isn’t for everyone, but if you’re a fan of hikes, you’ll love the trail between Fira and Oia. This trail wraps up the west coast of Santorini, goes through Imerovigli, and offers hikers some of the best views on the island. We hiked it in high season and it wasn’t crowded at all!So you’ll also enjoy some peace and quiet.Depending on your pace (and of course how often you stop to take pictures and soak in the views) you could expect to take about 4 hours for the hike. If we remember right, we did it in about 2.5 hours, but then again, we hike on an almost weekly basis."
https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-yacht-week-greece/,The Ultimate Guide to The Yacht Week Greece,Greece,"For me, The Yacht Week Greece is the most well-balanced route of them all. You get the gorgeous sailing experience, incredible island destinations, delicious Greek food and fun parties. You definitely have one of the liveliest nightlife and party scenes compared to other routes.It’s non-stop fun!Rated on a scale of 1 (low) – 5 (high)Nightlife: 4You’re guaranteed to have some really fun nights on the Greece route. Bottle service is available at nearly every party and is great because you can save money on drinks with a big group. There are a LOT of organized parties on this route so bottle service costs can rack up quickly.Day Parties: 4One of the best day parties of all of the routes is the White Party on Ermioni island. There are lots of day party options along the route and plenty of opportunities to sail out and tie up to other boats for a little sipping and swimming.Activities: 4The Greece route is by far the best organized route. Sometimes things felt a little TOO organized at times but, remember, each activity organized on The Yacht Week is a suggestion and completely optional. If you want more free time to explore a destination, don’t get FOMO and skip some of the organized parties.Each island destination has something special to offer, whether it’s a donkey ride in Hydra or some island exploring.Local Culture: 3As with most places in Greece, there is a lot of tourism throughout the islands. It’s great in some ways because you won’t have any problem finding things to do or places to eat. But, you may get the tourist treatment (and prices)!Sailing Experience: 3Greece has some of the longest sailing days of all the routes. Like, 6 hours of sailing on some days. And most days you’ll be motoring, not sailing.It’s absolutely gorgeous and you will most likely spot dolphins along the way but, it can also feel like a really long day at sea depending on your experience with sailing. Fuel costs can also add up because of all the motoring.Size of Route: 4Approx. 15-25 boats per routeThe Greece routes can vary in size but we had about 12 boats on our route. It’s a good number of people for some really fun parties and you get to meet a lot of people from around the world.Extra Costs: 3One of the best things about the Greece route is that you almost never have to pay port fees cutting out a major expense you would incur on other routes. It’s definitely the least expensive route in terms of additional expenses.Food markets are also quite inexpensive and eating out can easily be done on a budget if necessary. Fuel will most likely be your biggest expense but overall costs still remain quite low. Pros of The Yacht Week Greece:Easy access to start locationWell organizedGorgeous destinationsCons of The Yacht Week Greece:Long sailing daysBottle service at parties can get expensive Before You GoThere are a few key things to prepare before any trip on The Yacht Week. Obviously, finding a killer crew, booking a boat and getting travel insurance are the most important!Finding a CrewWhether you have a group of friends ready to book the trip of a lifetime or not, there are a few key ingredients to putting together a crew. First off, you want a group of open-minded, fun-loving people (with at the very least, a mild sense of responsibility).TYW is all about having a good time, but keep in mind that carrying your own weight on costs, cleanup on the boat throughout the week and planning is essential for all crew members. Also, keep in mind that TYW has a “gender ratio” on most routes- meaning you’ve gotta bring some girls. Nobody wants a bro fest.If you don’t have a big enough group of friends to fill your boat, The Yacht Week crew finder is the best resource for putting together a crew. If you’re looking to join a crew, or are looking to fill your boat, you can find awesome people there to complete your tribe.Booking a BoatOnce you’re ready to book, the process is pretty straight forward. The Greece route now has 8 different weeks to choose from throughout July, August and September.It is important to remember that most of the boats don’t have A/C or fans in the cabins, so bring you own battery-powered fans!BOOK The Yacht Week Greece HEREGetting Travel InsuranceI know. I know. Nobody likes to talk about this stuff. But, what do you get when you mix cocktails, sunscreen and a boat deck? A blonde and a broken arm. A broken arm on a remote island means a first-class helicopter ride and thousands of dollars in medical bills. Get travel insurance.You can read more about why you need travel insurance, but consider it a small price to pay for the reassurance of a great trip. One person in your crew should also pack a First-Aid kit. Cuts and boo-boos happen all the time.Get a travel insurance quote here!What to Pack for The Yacht WeekPacking for The Yacht Week is pretty much the same whether you’re going to Croatia or the BVIs. Be sure to read my complete packing guide “How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry On,” but here is a list of the essentials:BagFirst things first, do everything in your power to pack in a soft duffle bag. If everyone arrives with big, hard suitcases there is nowhere to store them and they will lay on top of your beds or in the living room. It’s the worst. Most cabins have mini-closets so you’re able to unpack most of your things and roll the duffle bag up to store completely out of your way.Duffle bag for your carry-onSmall cross body-bag for everyday useProps & ToysCountry flag for your crewWater-GunsBody-PaintInflatable rafts & floatiesMisc.Auxiliary-cordCD’s- Each boat has a different sound system setup. To be safe, I always bring an auxiliary-cord and make a handful of CD’s as well. Throw some 90’s songs on there just for nostalgia.LifeProof Waterproof iPhone CaseGoPro with Floaty BackSelfie Stick – I know they don’t make you look cool, but this is one trip you’ll want oneMulti-port chargerFloating key chain (optional)Dry-bag (optional) – if you are bringing a camera or any electronic that is not waterproofBattery powered fan for your cabin (optional) – some boats have A/C, some have fans… and some do notREAD MORE: How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry OnGetting ThereYachts on The White Route will depart from Lavrio Marina and yachts on The Blue Route from Alimos Marina. The closest airport to both marinas is Athens International Airport.Arrival Day and TimeEveryone arrives at different times on Saturday and access to your boat usually isn’t until 6pm, but it’s best to arrive that day by 3pm to take care of check-in, grab a cocktail with your crew, then do your grocery shopping. The first night you will stay in the marina and Sunday morning you set sail.Departure Day and TimeYou will get back to the marina on Friday afternoon and have to check out and leave the yacht by 9am on Saturday, so don’t book any flights until Saturday afternoon at least.Extra CostsIn addition to the cost of the yacht, meals and transportation costs,  you will also have to pay for the fuel and port fees during the week that you sail.I’ve included the different prices from The Yacht Week website in the list below.The prices you see below are calculated on a Bavaria 45, which is a yacht with 10 beds. The prices will vary depending on what size of boat you choose.TOTAL PER YACHTCOUNTRY WATER  FUEL PORT FEESTOTALGreece$95$300$130$500 – 530And last, but not least, don’t forget to tip your “skip” at the end of your trip. (They’re not just there as eye-candy. That’s just a huge bonus.)Grocery Shopping GuideI’ve consistently found that grocery shopping for a boat of 10 people costs between $1000-$1500 for the entire week. So, assume approximately $120 minimum needs to be pooled from each crew member.(NOTE: Consider your skipper an extra head to count when doing your food and booze shopping for the boat. A well-fed skipper is a happy skipper.)I personally sailed from the Lavrio Marina and have to say it’s the best marina of all routes on The Yacht Week to shop from. Both the grocery store and super market are within walking distance of the marina. The super market also carries all kinds of fun stuff like inflatables, party supplies and all the essentials.BreakfastYogurt and granola with fresh fruit is pretty much my go-to breakfast on sailing trips. But, eggs also keep really well! Buy bagels and the fixings and some fresh bread so you can make egg sandwiches or toast. Don’t forget instant coffee if you are a morning coffee drinker!LunchIn Greece, you can’t go wrong stocking up with supplies to make a giant Greek salad every day for lunch. Buy lots of tomatoes, onion, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, olives, feta cheese and balsamic & olive oil. It’s easy to prepare a big portion for everyone to share, then each person can make whatever else they feel like: canned tuna, a sandwich, pasta, etc.DinnersYou can plan to eat out for most dinners — and Greece you’ll find most meals can be quite cheap (between 5-10 euros)! There will be one night in a natural harbor that you’ll have to prepare dinner on your own boat, so make sure to stock up for at least one dinner onboard.Note: All boats have stovetops and small refrigerators, and most catamarans have a BBQ on the back, but double check before you head to the store.SnacksDon’t forget to buy lots of snacks! Stick to your senses- something salty, sweet, savory and sour! Lots of chips, some gummy candies, fresh fruit, dry meats & cheeses with crackers, etc. Hard boiling eggs and keeping them in a ziplock in the fridge is also a great idea for a quick protein packed snack.DrinksBuy lots of water. The rule of thumb is 1.5 liters per person per day. Best tip is that everyone brings their own refillable water bottle, then buy water in gallon jugs. As for alcohol- buy twice as much as you think you need! A few bottles of wine for meals, lots of champagne, rosé, beer, hard alcohol and mixers!CondimentsThere might be salt and pepper on the boat, but don’t count on it. You’ll need to buy your own spices, sauces, mayonnaise, ketchup, etc.SuppliesDon’t forget things like paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags and ziplock bags! For grilling, the charcoal bricks make life really easy. More InformationBook the Yacht Week Greece Here "

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-the-greek-islands/,Helpful Tips For Traveling the Greek Islands,Greece,"Updated: October 2019Greece is a country that has a significant amount of territory, with much of this spread over the hundreds of islands. You could easily spend months exploring this fascinating and historic area!There are some islands that are famous for their beaches and natural features, while others have a significant nightlife scene or strong cultural traditions.The islands can be grouped into broad clusters and, while many are inhabited, there are also plenty of smaller islands and outcroppings in the ocean that have no-one living there at all. After traveling to many beautiful destinations in Greece, I created this guide of helpful tips for traveling the Greek islands to help you plan your own trip!Here are my helpful tips for traveling the Greek Islands!  What to Expect in the Greek IslandsThe Greek Islands offer a fairly laid-back culture and one where there is an emphasis on enjoying life and everything it has to offer. (You can expect plenty of good food and drink during your trip!)Some islands have a much stronger tourist culture than others, so this can dictate how many people you are likely to encounter that speak English.Many of the islands are volcanic in origin, which tends to give them quite distinctive and dramatic scenery. This is particularly seen in Santorini, which has stunning villages making it one of the most romantic destinations in the islands.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to GreeceTips for Sailing the Saronic Islands in GreeceTop Romantic Getaways in Greece for Couples About  the Greek IslandsThere are a total of 168 inhabited Greek islands that are located in the Aegean and Ionian Seas, and these have been broadly split into eight main island groups.Crete is the largest of the Greek Islands and draws many visitors, while the Ionian Islands have popular destinations such as Corfu, Kefalonia, and Zante. Many of the biggest resorts and destinations with the best nightlife are found in this island chain.The Cyclades Islands have the best range of inhabited islands to visit, with Santorini famous for its towns and villages, and Mykonos and Paros home to some wonderful beaches.Helpful Tip:For a unique experience for “twenty-thirty somethings” that are interested in sailing the Greek islands with friends, The Yacht Week Greece route is a great blend of parties, sailing and local culture! I went with 7 girlfriends and we had the time of our lives!Read More:The Ultimate Greece Travel GuideThe Ultimate Santorini Travel GuideThe Ultimate Mykonos Travel GuideGetting Around  the Greek IslandsSome of the larger Greek Islands will have airports which can accept international flights, with the airports in Rhodes and Corfu among the largest offering the broadest range of flights.However, if you are planning to see different islands and explore several different parts of the region, then the only real way to travel between the islands economically is by ferry.Because it is such a large area, there are a variety of ferry companies serving different parts of the islands, and the prices and schedule can vary dramatically, particularly if you are looking to travel outside the main tourist season.Read More: A Quick Guide to the Best Greek Islands to Visit    Take Travel Time into AccountAn easy mistake to make if you are going from one Greek island to another is to assume that it is only going to be a short trip by boat. The reality is that the hundreds of inhabited islands are actually spread over a vast area.In fact, there are some journeys that can take ten hours or more by ferry, particularly if you are starting the journey from the port in Piraeus (the main ferry port for Athens). How to Budget for Your TripThe type of budget that you can put together will vary depending on how flexible you are, where you will be looking to stay and whether you are going to be looking to eat and drink in top-end establishments.Hostel beds are often available for around ten euros per night, while budget hotel rooms can be found from around twenty-five euros upwards. Keep in mind, prices do tend to increase in the larger resorts and destinations, particularly in the peak season.If you skip the fancy cocktails and eat from street vendors then you can get by on ten to twenty euros a day for food and drink. You will also need to budget for activities, particularly if you are going to be taking trips to the best beaches or exploring the major historical sites.Read More: Tips for Traveling Greece on a BudgetQuick Guide to the Best Greek IslandsHere’s a quick guide to some of the best Greek islands that offer visitors unique experiences!The Best Beaches: Naxos and ParosThe Best for Natural Beauty: CreteThe Best for Low-Key Luxury: AntiparosThe Most Charming: HydraThe Most Romantic: SantoriniThe Best for College-Aged Partying: IosThe Best for 20 to 30-Something Partying: MykonosCheck out more about my favorite picks my quick guide to the best Greek Islands to visit!Do you have any tips for traveling the Greek Islands?

https://theblondeabroad.com/mykonos-greece-beach-and-party-guide/,Mykonos Beach and Party Guide,Greece,"Updated: July 2019I have to admit that when I went to Mykonos this summer I was completely caught off guard. I was well prepared and very excited for a relaxing and sun-soaked holiday on the beautiful beaches of Mykonos.Little did I know, that of all of the Greek islands, Mykonos is famed for incredible beaches but especially for the world-renowned party scene. If I were to relate my experience in Mykonos to anything, it would be that of a raging good time in Vegas.Parties all day. Parties all night.So, for newbies to this particular Greek island, I’ve created this Mykonos Beach and Party Guide to help you gauge your trip depending on what you want to experience… whether it’s a low key beachside stay or one of the craziest weeks of partying you’ve ever experienced!Use the sample scale below for reference on each suggestion! Helpful Tip:If you’re going to be drinking, it’s best to take to local buses from the beaches and nightclubs to Mykonos Town. They operate regularly to and from Fabrika (in Mykonos Town) to all major beaches and many of the big clubs and are very affordable.Note that if you want to rent a scooter in Mykonos, you need a motorcycle license, but you can rent an ATV with a driver’s license. Most locations in Mykonos and around Greece require an international license, which you can obtain here for only $24 and get emailed to you to print within a few hours of ordering. Psarou BeachPsarou Beach was one of the most luxurious and calm beaches I went to. I really loved it here because it is a bit further away from downtown Mykonos and you get a break from all of the crazy party beaches.If you’re looking to sip on cocktails and soak up some sun, are traveling with family or prefer a more resort style beach in Mykonos, this is your spot! Elia BeachElia is the longest sandy beach in Mykonos and while it has a bunch of options, from taverns and bars to water sports, it’s a pretty tame place to hang out at. 180 Sunset BarThe 180 Sunset Bar at Mykonos Castle offers endless views of the horizon. Here, it’s all about cocktails here while listening chill beats.Any great sunset spot in Mykonos (bar or restaurant) comes with a hefty price tag. You’ll need a reservation and at a minimum, spend about 50 euros per person—which is pretty easy to do…even with just 2 drinks!The Belvedere HotelThe rooftop Belvedere poolside lounge and cocktail bar cannot be missed at sunset. I think I’ll let the picture below speak for itself! The intimate atmosphere here is fantastic and, for you night owls, they’re even open late at night.This is a great spot for a date or a beautiful evening with friends. Be sure to try their Lychee Mojito or a “Blonde Jack” (it’s off the menu). You won’t regret it! ScorpiosSo, I have mixed feelings about Scorpios. I expected it to be right up my alley—with a lineup of a lot of familiar DJs I see every year at Burning Man, from Bedouin to Bob Moses to Lee Burridge to Goldcap. I can’t deny I loved the bohemian-inspired design and the location is perfect for sunset. Truly, this place would be the ideal location for an epic sunset party!However, the prices here are pretty insane. We actually walked out after sitting down for dinner when seeing the prices. I really cringe when people try to exploit “rituals” and “spiritual” experiences by charging a premium. I also found that the staff wasn’t as welcoming as some of the other places we visited.I tried to establish how the sunset live music worked and I know bottle service is required for tables (at a minimum, you’ll be spending 2000-5000 euros), but you might also be able to come to watch the sunset for a cover fee, or for free (with reservation).Either way, if you’re headed to Scorpios, be prepared to spend $$$$$$ to enjoy a minimalist electronic sunset. Super Paradise BeachThe beach stays quiet but the beach bar gets going in the late afternoon. There’s a small dock here that’s great for practicing your cannonballs and the water is absolutely picturesque.Mykonos has a large gay scene so it’s hard to say one beach is more gay than another, but this beach, in particular, has a reputation for being a “gay beach.”Straight, gay or indifferent it’s a must-see while beach hopping in Mykonos!The beach party here at the Super Paradise Beach Bar makes for great people watching and the male go-go dancers might as well be Greek Gods. Oh ya, I almost forgot…bikinis and banana hammocks are optional. Paraga BeachI loved Paraga Beach and it ended up being my go-to beach! The beach is absolutely beautiful and has lounge chairs available to rent for a low price. You can get beachside food and drink service and everything is fairly priced and really delicious.Everything stays mellow until around 4 pm and then the Kalua Beach Bar turns into a crazy party!It has a really nice vibe (things stay classy unlike many of the beach parties) and is a sure-bet for a good time! Plus, how cool is it that you can swim out to shallow rocks and it looks like you’re walking on water? Paradise BeachThe famous Tropicana Beach Bar takes this beach to the next level! I must admit I had a big (some might say huge) evening here. The party starts well before the sun sets and things really take off after sunset.The Italian MC, Sasa, here is absolutely hilarious!He walks around with a microphone wearing nothing but a g-string and makes random and vulgar (so inappropriate I cannot share them on my blog) comments to people. Tropicana is a place where you need to “open your mind,” but it is definitely the ultimate beach party in Mykonos! Scandinavian BarLocated in downtown Mykonos, you will find Scandinavian Bar and it gets packed! Expect to see the upstairs area overflowing with dancing bodies and, not to mention, plenty of girls up on the bar getting wild.If the upstairs area is too crazy there is still a nice patio area outside where you can hear the music but enjoy your drink without being smothered by a stranger. Just as a heads up, guys and girls, expect to pay a cover fee to enter. Cavo ParadisoWhile I haven’t been to Cavo Paradise just yet, they do get some top-of-the-line DJs! It’s meant to be a big party. If you go, you’ll have to report back in the comments. 😉Paradise Club MykonosFor a real nightclub experience while in Mykonos it doesn’t get any better than this! Paradise Club Mykonos brings in the biggest DJs from all over the world and throws one hell of a party.The night I flew into Mykonos we went straight to Paradise Club for headlining DJ, Dirty South. Just a few nights before that, Kaskade had performed. Three nights later, I saw DJ Chuckie rock the house. You get my point.And even if you have no idea who I’m talking about don’t worry about it. Just go. (As a side note: You WILL get kicked out if you jump in the pool. I may or may not be speaking from personal experience…) So, as you can see, Mykonos has a wide range of beaches and amazing nightlife! There’s only one other thing… who’s ready to party?!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/athens-greece-days/,"What to Do in Athens, Greece in Three Days",Greece,"There is so much to see and do in Athens, Greece! While visiting Athens, I had three days to explore the ancient city and make the most of my vacation.Here are my tips on what to do in Athens in three days!Where to Stay in AthensAthens Studios is a really nice hostel/hotel in the heart of the city just within walking distance of the Acropolis, and is where I stayed when I was backpacking through Greece! If you’re on a budget, check out BedBox Hostel in the city center.For beautiful, but super affordable private rooms, check out Tier Collection or Exarcheia House for your stay.Tips for Getting Around AthensFlying In:If you fly into Athens, it’s €8 (or €14 for two people) to take the metro to the Acropolis station. The Athens metro system is incredibly easy in Athens and you will only need to make one change from the blue line at Syntagma to the red line and exit Acropolis.Note: The journey takes around 45 minutes, so if you decide to take the metro back to the airport when you leave plan accordingly.Ferry from Greek Islands:Ferries will vary in price if you are coming from another Greek island. I actually came to Athens from Mykonos on a fast ferry for around €50. When you arrive at the port you can get a cab (don’t pay more than €20) and have them drop you off at your hotel or the Acropolis metro if they aren’t familiar.Read More: Helpful Tips for Traveling the Greek IslandsDay 1: Get Your Bearings of the CityWalking Tour of AthensI went on a walking tour my first morning in the city so I could get some background info and get a feel for navigating the city. The tour lasted over 3 hours and took us to all of the archeological sites in Athens.Our guide was incredibly knowledgable and gave us really good advice on how to spend our time in Athens. Visit the Acropolis MuseumTake an hour or so to get some history and view some of the preserved ruins of the Acropolis. The Acropolis Museum is a must-see! The entrance and parts of the museum have glass floors that look down on ancient ruins. (€5/€3 students)Lunch at the Acropolis MuseumYou cannot beat the view from the café at the museum. After you finish exploring the museum be sure to stop in for a bite to eat. It is on the second floor and the outdoor patio looks out to the Acropolis in the distance.It is absolutely stunning!Also, every Friday night the Acropolis Museum Café is open until midnight offering a specialty dinner. (Free WiFi)Stroll the National Gardens & Window ShopEnjoy the beautiful gardens in the late afternoon. They’re fairly small so you can walk through them in under an hour. You can then walk to Syntagma Square and down Ermou Street to the main shopping areas. (Garden entrance free)Greek DinnerBe sure to try a traditional Greek salad and Gyro Pita! It’s cheap, tasty and you can find them on EVERY corner!Day 2: Start Visiting the Archaeological SitesAcropolisAfter breakfast get an early start at the Acropolis. Enter at the South entrance across the street from the Museum and explore the perimeter of the Acropolis on your walk up the Sacred Rock. The whole visit will take anywhere between 1-2 hours. (More info to buy your pass for all of the sites here €20; €10 for students)The Ancient AgoraTake the north exit and walk down to the Ancient Agora. Parts of it have been beautifully restored and the museum is fantastic. (Included with your pass)Cooking ClassI didn’t have time to do a cooking class, but I wish I had! This Traditional Greek cooking class includes a market visit and a full meal.LunchI grabbed a light lunch of a feta-filled croissant and freddo cappuccino from one of the many cafés across from the Acropolis metro station. It was a good power lunch to keep me going without filling up.Walk to the Athens Flea MarketCheck out the cheap souvenir shopping and grab some fresh fruit to snack on. There are little fruit stands all over selling inexpensive cherries, nectarines and pretty much everything you could imagine!Dinner by RecommendationWhile you’re out during the day, ask some of the shop owners/vendors where they like to eat. Best advice ever: Do as the locals do! (Especially with food!)Day 3: Last Day of SightseeingThe Temple of Olympian ZeusThe largest temple of the ancient ruins in Athens and conveniently located in the heart of the city. It won’t take long to visit the site but it is quite impressive. Be sure not to miss it! (Included with your pass)Lunch at Fish CaféLocated next door to Athens Studios… this place rocks! Honestly one of the best meals I had in Athens. It’s cheap, delicious and they bake their bread fresh every day. Try the veggie or fish burger!The Library of HadrianThe last of the major ancient archeological sites to visit! Be sure to get there with time to visit the museum inside the site. I got there 30 minutes before closing and didn’t have time to check it out. (Included with your pass)Snack AttackSummertime in Athens is HOT! I ended up there on the hottest day of summer. Luckily, there’s Snoyo! It’s a Greek frozen yogurt shop on the strip across from the Acropolis metro station. Try the plain yogurt with cherry spoon sweets. (To. Die.

The Acropolis is open until 7 PM. All sites open at 8 AM. Buy the €20 pass (€10 for students) for entry to all sites.Brush Up on Your Architectural HistoryWell, maybe not necessary. But, at least for a general understanding of how old things really are, refresh yourself on the classical order. Here’s a guide on the three types of columns you will see at the ancient ruins. Doric being the oldest, then Ionic and then Corinthian.The Acropolis Museum is Closed on MondaysJust double-check before you go!Beware of GypsiesWhile it may sound a bit odd there are a lot of gypsy children around Athens! And they work in pairs. If a child comes up to you asking for money or they are playing an instrument (usually the accordion) it can be to distract you while the other child pickpockets you. Beware!Allow for Free TimeAs with all travel, be sure to allow for variations in your schedule. This is just a guideline to help you through some parts of the city, so be sure to spend plenty of time wandering and discovering the city on your own!Recommended Tours in Athens! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-antigua/,Where to Find the Best Food in Antigua,Guatemala," This Antigua Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!The idea of visiting the country of Guatemala had been on the periphery for me for years. While traveling around South America in 2012, I heard nothing but positive stories and strong sentiments about how special the country was from other travelers.While I never made it into Central America that year, Guatemala had made its way onto my gastronomical bucket list. In December 2018, with no solid plan in place, I decided it was time to make my trip to Guatemala a reality.The city of Antigua exceeded all expectations.  A small colonial town that dates back to the 1500s, it’s now considered a Unesco World Heritage site, and for a good reason.The streets are absolutely breathtaking and open your eyes to a feeling of magic around every corner. I could not get over how incredibly charming everything about this place was; I would recommend it in a second.Here’s my guide on where to find the best food in Antigua from my week in Guatemala! Cactus Taco ShopCactus Taco Shop is both light-hearted and spirited, two traits that are apparent the moment you walk inside.  Bold quotes and graffiti cover the walls, and bright blue painted tables line the floors. The menu is big, offering burritos, enchiladas, tortas, soups and multiple types of tacos that you can mix and match with each other.  My favorite bite was the taco with grilled shrimp. Caoba FarmsAbout 10 minutes outside the city, Caoba Farms is a sprawling piece of land. It’s home to an organic grocery store, several pop up shops, a massive garden and greenhouse, and at the center, a true farm-to-table outdoor restaurant experience.  Here we sampled the bean and quinoa burger topped with hummus, spinach, avocado, tomato and cheese, and the falafel plate with veggies and fresh dips. We ate to the tunes of some live music playing as we relaxed and dined amongst the greenery and warm sunshine.   Bistro 5Bistro 5 is a charming little French place that we stumbled into for a glass of whiskey on our first night in town. Dimly lit with peeling exposed brick walls, the restaurant does its best to mimic a Parisian atmosphere from years back, complete with pommes frites and kitschy mermaid lamps on the bar. TartinesThe views from the small terrace of Tartines are worth the visit alone.  Perched just above the ruins of the Cathedral, you can look straight at them as you sip some wine and enjoy a quiet dinner.  The fish of the day was grouper, cooked in a sauce of tomatoes, black olives, and capers.  Sabe RicoThe backyard of the laid back Sabe Rico keeps on going like a winding secret garden.  Entirely outdoors and sectioned off into different areas all with slightly different decor, this is a perfect spot to spend a few sunny hours sipping beers and having breakfast or lunch.  The shakshuka here was a standout and ordering with a side of blue corn tortillas made it even more special.  Y Tu Pina TambienThis simple breakfast and lunch spot was the sweetest.  Tiny, charming, mostly painted in shades of turquoise and yellows, Y Tu Pina Tambien is the quintessential easy-going daytime place to sample a traditional Guatemalan breakfast.  The “El Chapin,” which appropriately translates to Breakfast of Champions, was the perfect start to a day of wandering and exploration.  Cafe No SeCafe No Se is a dark, hole in the wall mezcal bar that is a must visit.  You order either straight shots of mezcal with a side of the local beer, or their version of a Paloma, which was excellent.  If you want to catch some live music, there’s usually something going on at 9 pm most nights of the week. Cafe SkyOwned by an English man that moved to Antigua ten years ago, Cafe Sky has a large, usually packed rooftop that is perfect for watching the sun go down.   From this vantage point, you can see the entire cityscape sprawling in front of you, the cars whizzing by in the streets below, and active volcanoes spitting smoke into the sky above.   Hotel Casa Santa DomingoWhile I did not have a meal here, the premises are enough to put Hotel Casa Santa Domingo on this list.  The grounds are absolutely stunning and invite you into what feels like a whole other world. It’s worth having an afternoon wander here for sure. What are your favorite restaurants in Antigua? Let me know in the comments below? "

I had transferred from a community college to San Diego State University (SDSU) and was in my second semester of my first year as a declared Financial Services major.I had moved to the beautiful city of San Diego, California and was living with three of my best friends. Life was good!A little girl from the villageWhile most students were highly anticipating Spring Break vacations, I was planning on joining a student led volunteer effort in Honduras. Global Water Brigades (GWB) has school chapters all over the world organize students to volunteer over the 7-10 day length of their Spring Break.Outside of visiting orphanages in Mexico, I had never been a part of a volunteer program such as this. Our group from SDSU was the largest student group to volunteer with GWB at the time sending almost 30 students to Honduras.During our stay in Honduras, we surveyed a community for information for the next group of students coming to Honduras to use, while we used the information from students who were volunteering the week before us. Our goal was to build Pilas, or water storage tanks used for cleaning and storing water, and to hold informational meetings with the village about water sanitation.Because we had such a large group of students come to volunteer, we had raised enough money to build far more Pilas than anticipated, were able to build a few clean burning stoves, and helped teach modern agricultural techniques to the farmers.Visiting the ophanageOne project assigned to me while in Honduras was to help with a group of students in teaching water sanitation and health information at the local school. The children were so eager to learn and play with us even though we were singing songs about something as simple as washing your hands.It was such an eye opening experience for me at 20 years old. While we were visiting, a three year old in the village had died, which set everything into perspective.I realized, first hand, that some cultures don’t have the knowledge or comprehension of micro bacteria or have the resources to prevent many illnesses.The majority of my time was spent with a family building a Pila. A simple water storage tank doesn’t seem like a big deal, but when offered to the family, the information was received with gratitude and tears of joy. I’ll never forget the woman asking me, “does your family have a Pila?” What could I say?I turn on the faucet and know that, no matter what, water will always come out. The woman who lived at the home was raising her grandson, while her single daughter lived in the city, working hard to provide for all of them.The Pila would bring a new way of life for the family and community, allowing them to store the most precious resource to them in a sanitary place. Overall, my experience was unforgettable.The group of students I shared this trip with were incredible people with a desire to help those less fortunate. We left sustainable improvements with a small community in Honduras which, in turn, left a huge mark on my heart that inspires me to this day.For more information on all of the Global Brigades program visit their website: http://www.globalbrigades.org/"
https://theblondeabroad.com/top-sailing-destinations-in-croatia/,Top Sailing Destinations in Croatia,Croatia,"With its turquoise waters, stone castles and streets, party boats, and 200-year-old forts, there’s something for everyone in Croatia. It’s no wonder it has become the “it” travel spot in Europe. I visited Croatia with the Yacht Week Croatia, where we sailed to 6 unbelievable spots to see what Croatia has to offer.Here is my itinerary and the top sailing destinations in Croatia!Day 1: TrogirMedieval walls, built between the 13th and 14th century, surround this tiny island. We’re talking very tiny.You could walk from one end to the other in five minutes. However, it’s packed with charm as you explore the historical monuments.Two yacht marinas cater to those who love boating while the seafront nightclubs and bars accommodate for the younger crowd. It’s also been known as the perfect spot for Instagram lovers.To get your history fill, hit up spots like Kamerlengo fortress or the Cathedral of St. Lawrence, both of which give you incredible views of the city.Day 2: VisHave you seen Mamma Mia 2? If so, they shot it on the island of Vis in Croatia which happens to be the second stop along this route.While there, stop by Kit, a series of courtyards and alleys built by the Venetians in the 17th century. Here you’ll find mini-marts and restaurants with incredibly delicious Italian food along with seafood.Plus you will find some of the clearest water you have ever seen.Because the island is so small, one of the best ways to get around is by scooter. After riding around all day, stop for a sunset dinner at Fort George.Days 3 & 4: HvarWith 2724 sunny hours each year, Hvar Island offers swanky hotels, chic boutiques, and posh bars and restaurants. It’s the ideal spot to rub shoulders with yachties and party-goers while sipping on a cocktail. In fact, it’s been named as the best Croatian island for nightlife.Aside from its party reputation, Hvar is famed for its lavender fields and olive trees that were laid out by Greek colonists. The trees have been preserved for over two and a half thousand years. Day 5: Natural Bay on Stari GradDespite being located on Hvar’s north coast, Stari Grad is a far more quiet affair. Stari Grad means “old town,” fitting for the fact that it was founded in 384 BC by the ancient Greeks.This makes it one of the oldest towns on the European continent.Be sure to visit Petar Hektorović Castle, the most famous building in Stari Grad. The Renaissance poet built it throughout his life, and he carved more than 20 inscriptions in both Latin and Italian into the building. Day 6: BolBol is situated on the Southern part of the island Brac and is the oldest town. It’s quickly become a tourist destination because of its sandy beaches that expand over 10 km.It’s also home to Croatia’s most famous beach, Zlatni Rat. It’s the perfect place for anyone who loves the outdoors, and you can spend your time playing volleyball, football, swimming, or windsurfing in the warm air. Day 7: SplitSplit is a blend of ancient and modern. Split (Spalato in Italian) is Croatia’s second largest city, and it’s always buzzing.Roman ruins and museums sit alongside cafes and trendy shops. It’s no surprise that it became a film location for “Game of Thrones.”Some of the highlights include Diocletian’s Palace, built in 305 AD for the Roman Emperor Diocletian, the Bell Tower of St. Dominus Cathedral, and Old Town. Can’t forget the beaches!Additional DestinationsA few additional destinations to sail to in Croatia include Dubrovnik, Sipan, Mljet, Korcula, and Brac.Check out more information about The Yacht Week Croatia here! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-go-on-the-yacht-week/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Go on The Yacht Week,Croatia,"During my first The Yacht Week, I knew this amazing sailing adventure had to be a yearly tradition. Since my first trip down the Adriatic coastline, I have now been on been aboard these gorgeous yachts in the British Virgin Islands, Greece, Italy, Grenada and Croatia.I’ve been on four all-girls trips on The Yacht Week and it has quickly become one of my fave girlfriend getaways.Not only is it ideal for reconnecting with your girls, it is also a perfect time to meet people from around the globe. I’ve made incredible lasting friendship with so many great people from Canada to Australia and beyond, while creating lasting memories with my besties.Another thing that I love about The Yacht Week is that you can see so many stunning spots without having to deal with all of the logistics. TYW has routes in Montenegro, Italy, Granada, Greece, and Croatia (you can now choose from original Croatian route or the Ultra Festival tour of Croatia).There are so many gorgeous coastlines on every route and being at sea will give you a totally different perspective of the regions.While I love organizing girls’ getaway to see far-flung destinations, it can be a major headache to actually get it all done. I am obsessed with TYW because it makes things so easy.Once you get on board all of your transportation is taken care of and you can see tons of different places while only unpacking once. You don’t have to split the bill all of the time or try to plan things that everybody will like.Expenses are straightforward and everything else is done for you. I’ve always done one big grocery shop before the trip then created a group fund to cover all of the outings.Once that’s all done there’s nothing else to worry about buying during the trip. Once you set sail, you can hang out together with your friends or get out there mingle.This is especially nice in my opinion because it means you can get in some quality time without being attached at the hip 24/7.So, ladies, are you ready to grab your bikinis and get the party started? The only question is which trip to go for?The Yacht Week Croatia was my first TYW experience and it’ll always be a special place for me. This destination is so popular that they have actually created two tour paths now and they’re both worth looking into.The Yacht Week British Virgin Islands was my second trip and it was full of beautiful turquoise waters, sandy beaches and lots of palm trees.I love The Yacht Week Italy because it’s an opportunity to explore Sicily and its unique culture. And the views! The Italian route brings you past some of the most beautiful scenery in the world.For me, The Yacht Week Greece is the most well-balanced route of them all and you’ll get to see and do SO much.I still have Montenegro and Granada on my travel bucket list, so it’s up to you guys to tell me how those are!So what are you waiting for?[button link=”http://bit.ly/2gUfmW3″ color=”lightgray” size=”xlarge” type=”” shape=”” target=”_blank” title=”BOOK THE YACHT WEEK HERE” gradient_colors=”|” gradient_hover_colors=”|” accent_color=”” accent_hover_color=”” bevel_color=”” border_width=”1px” shadow=”{{shadow}}” icon=”” icon_divider=”yes” icon_position=”left” modal=”” animation_type=”0″ animation_direction=”down” animation_speed=”0.1″ alignment=”center” class=”” id=””]BOOK THE YACHT WEEK HERE[/button]"

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-the-yacht-week-croatia/,The Ultimate Guide to The Yacht Week Croatia,Croatia,"The route that rules them all! Where do I begin? I have a soft spot for The Yacht Week Croatia route as it was my first experience on The Yacht Week and I obviously had such a good time that I came back… 4 more times.Because of the massive interest in this route, they now have a black and red route that runs the same route but starting and ending in opposite directions.There’s also the Croatia ULTRA route that takes place during the ULTRA Music Festival. I have done both the “normal” route and the ULTRA route and I personally prefer the normal route. While I had a blast, the ULTRA route had a completely different vibe than what I feel The Yacht Week is all about. You sort of lose the magic of the experience being all about the sailing and the destination because it’s centered around a music festival.For that reason, I’ve included information below that highlights the red & black routes on The Yacht Week Croatia!Rated on a Scale of 1 (low) – 5 (high)Nightlife: 5The parties can’t be beat- whether it’s the Fort George “party in a castle” or the world-famous parties on Hvar island.If you want a once-in-a-lifetime party experience, then nothing compares to the Croatia route. If you aren’t a huge “partier” and are more interested in a cultural travel and sailing experience, I’d suggest one of the other routes.Day Parties: 5Some of the best day parties are also on the Croatia route. Whether it’s a massive raft party (where the boats are tied up in a big circle) or Carpe Diem club on Hvar, this route definitely takes the cake.The final regatta is also best on the Croatia route where the crews of each boat dress up and race for eternal glory.(Well, more like bottle service at Club Vanilla but who’s counting?)Activities: 3Most of The Yacht Week routes offer daytime activities to explore the destination but Croatia doesn’t offer too much outside of the organized parties. However, the routes now offer daily yoga and paddle boarding, which is a big plus. I highly suggest coming to Croatia a few days early or staying a few days after to, at the very least, see nearby Krka National Park.Local Culture: 2The Croatia route is 110% about partying, so this route kind of misses any real interaction with Croatian culture unless you go seeking it. While it is about having a great time, there’s a level of sophistication that has been upheld by TYW and its guests that has kept it an amazing experience and not a trashy version of MTV’s Spring Break Cancun.Because of the massive amount of tourism on the Croatian coast and islands (on and off of TYW) do your best to be a respectable visitor to this region. Party tourism is a touchy subject, so do your best not to be a drunk asshole outside of the party environment.Sailing Experience: 3Since this route is more focused on the partying I highly suggest getting a skipper — even if you sail and it’s your passion. If you want to sail yourself for the sailing experience, consider another route. You don’t want to leave the party early or sail drunk.The Croatian coast is known for its incredible beauty, but there aren’t many days where you actually sail. Meaning you’ll have to motor because of lack of wind or the need to get to the next destination quickly. The sailing days can be short, which is a good or a bad thing depending on how you look at it (or how hungover you are).Size of Route: 5Approx. 50 boats per route (2 route options)This route is the most well known and draws a LOT of people from around the world. I loved that in the course of the week I made friends from over 10 different nations. Most of whom I still remain close friends with years later. There is no big difference between the Red and Black routes – they visit the same islands, just on different days.Extra Costs: 5While grocery shopping isn’t too expensive in general in Croatia, this route can rack up some serious extra costs. Port fees can cost more than $100 a night, parties can be expensive (especially if you’re buying bottle service), and you will burn through some fuel. Pros of The Yacht Week Croatia:Original and biggest routeBest nightlifeSIZE OF ROUTEGreat day partiesLost of FUN!Cons of The Yacht Week Croatia:High additional costs along the routeLow emphasis on local cultureWeather can be unpredictableBefore You GoThere are a few key things to prepare before any trip on The Yacht Week. Obviously, finding a killer crew, booking a boat and getting travel insurance is the most important!Finding a CrewWhether you have a group of friends ready to book the trip of a lifetime or not, there are a few key ingredients to putting together a crew. First off, you want a group of open-minded, fun-loving people (with at the very least, a mild sense of responsibility).TYW is all about having a good time, but keep in mind that carrying your own weight on costs, clean up on the boat throughout the week and planning is essential for all crew members. Also, keep in mind that TYW has a “gender ratio” on most routes- meaning you’ve gotta bring some girls.Nobody wants a bro fest.If you don’t have a big enough group of friends to fill your boat, The Yacht Week crew finder is the best resource for putting together a crew. If you’re looking to join a crew, or are looking to fill your boat, you can find awesome people there to complete your tribe.Booking a BoatOnce you’re ready to book, the process is pretty straightforward. The Croatia route now has 7 different weeks to choose from throughout July, August and September.It is important to remember that most of the boats don’t have A/C or fans in the cabins, so bring your own battery-powered fans!Book the Yacht Week Croatia HereGetting Travel InsuranceI know. I know. Nobody likes to talk about this stuff. But, what do you get when you mix cocktails, sunscreen, and a boat deck? A blonde and a broken arm. A broken arm on a remote island means a first-class helicopter ride and thousands of dollars in medical bills. Get travel insurance.You can read more about why you need travel insurance, but consider it a small price to pay for the reassurance of a great trip. One person in your crew should also pack a First-Aid kit. Cuts and boo-boos happen all the time.Get a travel insurance quote here!What to PackPacking for The Yacht Week is pretty much the same whether you’re going to Croatia or the BVIs. Be sure to read my complete packing guide “How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry On,” but here is a list of the essentials:BagFirst things first, do everything in your power to pack in a soft duffle bag. If everyone arrives with big, hard suitcases there is nowhere to store them and they will lay on top of your beds or in the living room.It’s the worst.Most cabins have mini-closets so you’re able to unpack most of your things and roll the duffle bag up to store completely out of your way.Duffle bag for your carry-onSmall cross body-bag for everyday useProps & ToysCountry flag for your crewWater-GunsBody-PaintInflatable rafts & floatiesMiscellaneousAuxiliary-cordCD’s- Each boat has a different sound system setup. To be safe, I always bring an auxiliary-cord and make a handful of CD’s as well. Throw some 90’s songs on there just for nostalgia.LifeProof Waterproof iPhone CaseGoPro with Floaty BackSelfie Stick – I know they don’t make you look cool, but this is one trip you’ll want oneMulti-port chargerFloating key chain (optional)Dry-bag (optional) – if you are bringing a camera or any electronic that is not waterproofBattery powered fan for your cabin (optional) – some boats have A/C, some have fans… and some do notRead More: How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry OnGetting to The Yacht Week CroatiaThe Yacht Week works with various marinas in Croatia and they are all located relatively close to Split Airport. The marina you will depart from and return back to depends on the yacht you choose. The marina is specified on yacht cards and in your booking.Arrival Day and TimeEveryone arrives at different times on Saturday but it’s best to arrive that day by 1 pm to take care of check-in, grab a cocktail with your crew, then do your grocery shopping.The yachts normally set sail between 4-6pm.Departure Day and TimeYou will get back to the marina on Friday afternoon and have to check out and leave the yacht before 9 am on Saturday morning. Remember the big closing party is Friday night, so pack up and get organized before you head out for the night (you may not come back to the boat until sunrise!)Extra Costs on The Yacht WeekIn addition to the cost of the yacht, meals and transportation costs, you will also have to pay for the fuel and port fees during the week that you sail. I’ve included the different prices from The Yacht Week website in the list below.The prices you see below are calculated on a Bavaria 45, which is a yacht with 10 beds. The prices will vary depending on what size of boat you choose.NAMEMARINABUOYANCHORTAXI SERVICESplit$105nonenonenoneVis$95$27$22includedKomiza$75$22none$11Hvar$100$33$33$16Palmizana$100nonenone$16Natural Baynonenone$27noneTOTAL PER YACHT (In USD)COUNTRY WATERFUELTAXIPORT FEESTOTALCroatia$90$290$290-300$780-800 About $1,500And last, but not least, don’t forget to tip your “skip” at the end of your trip. (They’re not just there as eye-candy. That’s just a huge bonus.)Grocery Shopping GuideI’ve consistently found that grocery shopping for a boat of 10 people costs between $1000-$1500 for the entire week. So, assume approximately $120 minimum needs to be pooled from each crew member.NOTE: Consider your skipper an extra head to count when doing your food and booze shopping for the boat. A well-fed skipper is a happy skipper.Both times I have done the Croatia route, I sailed from different marinas, so it’s best to wait for your Arrival Document for information on where is closest to your marina to shop.BreakfastYogurt and granola with fresh fruit is pretty much my go-to breakfast on sailing trips. But, eggs also keep really well! Buy bagels and the fixings and some fresh bread so you can make egg sandwiches or toast. Don’t forget instant coffee if you are a morning coffee drinker!LunchIn Croatia, you can’t go wrong stocking up with supplies to make a giant salad every day for lunch. Buy lots of tomatoes, onion, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, olives, mozzarella cheese balls and balsamic & olive oil. It’s easy to prepare a big portion for everyone to share, then each person can make whatever else they feel like: canned tuna, a sandwich, pasta, etc.DinnersYou can plan to eat out for most dinners — and, in Croatia, you’ll find most meals organized by The Yacht Week are worth attending!NOTE: All boats have stovetops and small refrigerators, and most catamarans have a BBQ on the back, but double check before you head to the store.SnacksDon’t forget to buy lots of snacks! Stick to your senses- something salty, sweet, savory and sour! Lots of chips, some gummy candies, fresh fruit, dry meats & cheeses with crackers, etc. Hard boiling eggs and keeping them in a ziplock in the fridge is also a great idea for a quick protein packed snack.DrinksBuy lots of water. The rule of thumb is 1.5 liters per person per day. Best tip is that everyone brings their own refillable water bottle, then buy water in gallon jugs. As for alcohol- buy twice as much as you think you need! A few bottles of wine for meals, lots of champagne, rosé, beer, hard alcohol, and mixers!CondimentsThere might be salt and pepper on the boat, but don’t count on it. You’ll need to buy your own spices, sauces, mayonnaise, ketchup, etc.SuppliesDon’t forget things like paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags and ziplock bags! For grilling, the charcoal bricks make life really easy. More InformationBook the Yacht Week Croatia Here "

Whatever your budget, whatever your interests, this is the place for you.You can have a great time in Croatia at any time of year. Traditionally, this eastern European country’s travel periods are broken up into three seasons: high, low, and shoulder season. Before you book your dates, choose your theme!Want a city break? A beach getaway? A spa retreat? Croatia has it. Here’s the best time to go to Croatia! Croatia’s Low SeasonMonths: October – AprilCroatia sees the fewest tourists from October to April. While it does get cold there, you can still have a fabulous time. The prices hit rock bottom throughout the country and it’s a perfect opportunity to have an ultra-luxe holiday for an incredible bargain. Go on a skiing sojourn. Enjoy a long, blissed-out spa stay.Stay away from the Adriatic coast during the winter—you’ll find nothing but closed beaches and abandoned resorts. Head inland for the best winter adventure. Fly into Dubrovnik or Zagreb and see how the locals live.While it may be the “low season,” Croatia is still poppin’ with activities—from the World Championship in Olive Picking (did you know there was such a thing?), to events surrounding Istria’s prized black and white truffles, and more!Zigante Truffle Days are 10 fun-filled weekends in the fall—starting in September, so check out their calendar to find exact dates. Events include delicious tastings of local dishes and wines as well as truffle hunts!Are you a total foodie? Check out the Good Food Festival in Dubrovnik which takes place in mid-October. There’s tons of decadent delights, street food, and beer, but the real star of the show is the Dubrovnik Table—a feast that takes place on the entire stretch of Stradun, the main pedestrian street in Old Town.If you are fortunate enough to get to Croatia during Christmas, the New Year, or Carnival, you are in for a serious treat. Croatian festivals are always fun so be sure to search local calendars to maximize your trip!When you aren’t partying it up, check out one of Croatia’s luxury hotel spas.

The afternoons are hot and the water is great for swimming.Croatian summers are known for their rocking music festivals so be sure to hit at least one while you are there. There are countless options: the INmusic Festival and International Folklore Festival in Zagreb and the ULTRA Music Festival in Split are among the continent’s top picks.The only downside to this time of year is that you’ll find yourself among a sea of tourists and you will end up paying the highest prices of the year. Ultimately, though, that’s what you’ll find on any quality beach during the summer and it is so worth it here!Highlights: ULTRA Music Festival, INmusic Festival and International Folklore Festival Croatia’s Shoulder SeasonMonths: May & SeptemberThe time on either side of the high season is what the pros call the “shoulder season.” This is definitely my favorite time to visit Croatia. During the month of May and again in September you will find truly perfect conditions.While the weather isn’t quite as reliable as it is during the peak season, you can still enjoy warm days with minimal crowds and lower prices.The beaches aren’t quite as hospitable in early summer and early autumn but that won’t stop you from having a great time! With temperatures pushing 100 degrees Fahrenheit during July and August, it can get overwhelming.If you want to explore the cities or hike the spectacular countryside, you will definitely appreciate the cooler days.Highlights: The Weather!So, guys, what’s it going to be?A mud bath in Zagreb or basking in the sun of Korčula Island? Whatever you pick, you are sure to fall in love with this remarkable eastern European gem."

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-lighthouse-in-croatia/,Staying in a Lighthouse in Croatia,Croatia,"By now, you probably know my love for the Istria region of Croatia- fresh seafood, olive oil, wine, rugged coastlines, and so much natural beauty. Last summer, I was lucky enough to enjoy the region all over again, including some amazing experiences I would have never thought possible.Well, off the coast of Pula, sits a beautiful little islet, and the Porer Lighthouse!Looking out to sea from Cape Kamenjak, the sight of the lighthouse during sunset was breathtaking. But it turns out, that lighthouse would be my nights’ accommodation, and I think I died a little inside.Porer, built in 1833, takes just two minutes to walk all the way around and the lighthouse can sleep eight people. It contains 2 small apartments, along with the the lighthouse keeper (and his adorable dog), and is available for rent.You heard me correctly!For less than $150 per night, even in the high season of July and August, you can stay in a private apartment in a lighthouse… on a small islet… off the stunning coast of Pula.Waking up to the gentle sounds of the water, salty air, and nothing else, was the most relaxing morning ever. While I did get up way too early to see the sunrise, it was worth it! Watching the sun rise over the Croatian coastline is something I would highly recommend to anyone traveling through.The lighthouse lies about a mile and a half southwest from the southernmost cape of Istria, Cape Kamenjak. The sea around the island is a great diving destinations, with shallow waters and underwater cliffs. It is also a sought after fishing destination!Other activities back on land, include exploring the town of Premantura, camping along the beaches, cliff jumping, and hanging out at Safari Bar– all of which sound like a great time to me!READ NEXT: Top 6 Foodie Experiences in Istria, Croatia More on Croatia TravelIstria: The Ultimate Gourmet GetawayVIDEO: Visiting Brijuni National Park in CroatiaTips for Visiting Plitvice Lakes in CroatiaWhere to Travel While the US Dollar is StrongStaying at Villa Meneghetti Wine Hotel in Istria, CroatiaShop my favorite nautical style items!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js'; var cb = new Date().getTime(); p += '?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');// ]]&gt; /* ]]> */"

https://theblondeabroad.com/istria-ultimate-gourmet-getaway/,Istria: The Ultimate Gourmet Getaway,Croatia,"The hilltop city of MotovunFor globe-trotting gourmands, look no further than Istria! I recently discovered this gastronomic region of Croatia and fell in love with the sights, smells and flavors specially characterized by this unique Mediterranean paradise.Here are just a few reasons why Istria is the ultimate gourmet getaway!The city of Rovinj LocationIstria is a heart-shaped peninsula in the northwest of Croatia (just south of Italy) that is specifically popular for agrotourism and is home to many artists and artisans.Its beautiful coastal towns, wineries and rolling green hills make Istria very popular for cycling. It could be compared to Tuscany and other “charming towns” but has its own unique culture and appeal.Exploring Rovinj Charming and Historical CitiesBe sure to explore the region and visit these beautiful cities that each have a special flare of their own:Motovun is a stunning hilltop medieval village located high above the wineries and truffle forests.Porec is a famous historical town located on the coast which is also known for it’s 6th century Euphrasian Basilica.Rovinj is also located on the coast and is actually the most visited destination in Croatia just after Dubrovnik. This fishing town not only provides amazing scenery but is known as the most romantic city in the Mediterranean.Novigrad, a town boasting peacefulness, cordiality, beauty and historical culture, is located on the south-west coast and is an ideal place if you want to avoid possible crowds in Rovinj.Istrian Olive Oil at Villa Meneghetti Olive OilIstria is known for its amazing olive oil and is often recognized as having some of the best in the entire world. Not only has it been an elixir in the Mediterranean bringing health, youth and beauty for thousands of years, Istria has ideal land for cultivating this liquid gold.Be sure to take a tour of the historical olive oil routes to sample some of the Istrian olive oil at the oil mills and cellars of the best Istrian olive growers!Wine and food pairing at Villa Meneghetti WineThe most famous wine from Istria is Malvazia that tastes fresh and is paired beautifully with seafood. Teran is another typical Istrian wine that has a long history in the region and is perfect for meat dishes.Whether you’re a fan of dessert wines or not, be sure to try the Istrian Muscat. Its unique scent of wild pink cloves and sweet aroma is delicious at the end of a meal.Because of Istria’s geographical location, climate and soil, the vineyards in Istria are able to produce some of the most high quality indigenous grape varieties for these particular wines.Set off on the wine roads of Istria and visit some of the wine cellars to see how each winemaker uses their own special methods for production.And, obviously, taste away!Truffle hunting TrufflesTruffles were discovered in the Istrian forests about 80 years ago and have been a culinary craving ever since. Not only is there an assortment of black truffles that grow throughout the forests but you can also find the world famous white truffle.For years, truffles have been believed to have an aphrodisiac effect which is just part of what gives the truffle its amazing reputation. Whether it’s shaved onto pasta or the essence used in olive oil, be sure to experience this culinary treat!You can even join in a truffle hunt at a family estate like Karlic Tartufi with one of their incredible truffle hunting dogs and guides!Homemade Honey Schnappes HoneyHoney has been used in Istrian households for centuries not just for food but medicine as well. While the production of this all-natural honey goes on all year long, it is in April when the beekeepers extract fruit and dandelion honey from the honeycomb to begin the process.There are several honey tours you can take to learn more about the art of beekeeping and sample and purchase everything from honey to pollen to royal jelly.Lunch at Toklarija, a slow food restaurant Slow FoodThe Istrian culture is a major promoter of the slow food lifestyle, which is exactly as it sounds, slow. Slow food is a way of eating that appreciates a full sit-down meal consisting of locally grown ingredients.It’s an amazing culinary experience!Kaštel Hotel Motovun Luxury Boutique HotelsThere are several luxury boutique hotels throughout the region that you can choose from to compliment your trip. A few of my suggestions are:San Rocco– an ideal place for relaxation in the city of Brtonigla near NovigradVilla Meneghetti– a boutique wine hotel set in a gorgeous villa in BaleHotel Kaštel– a beautiful hotel in a dreamy location atop MotovunWherever you choose, I am confident your stay will be memorable!Have you been to Istria?Special thanks to Istria Tourism for hosting me as their guest. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-villa-dora-kraljevica/,Staying at Villa Dora in Kraljevica,Croatia,"A little over a month ago I announced my move to Croatia, one of my favorite countries in the world. I planned to relocate to Kraljevica, a small town on the gorgeous Croatian coast, where I’d spend the next month. I had been jet-setting all over Europe for nearly 4 months and needed to slowwww things down.As a long-term traveler, sometimes the greatest gift you can give yourself is the permission to go somewhere beautiful and do absolutely nothing.The pace of tourism across Europe dies down a bit in the low-season (late September-October), so I knew that finding accommodation would be much easier than in the peak of summer.I quite literally stumbled upon a holiday rental property, called Villa Dora, and couldn’t believe my eyes. The pictures featured a beautiful Austro-Hungarian house from the 1930’s situated (quite literally) steps away from sapphire blue Adriatic Sea.It was love at first sight. After reaching out to the owner, a wonderfully kind and loving woman named Renata, I knew that I had found my new home. The bungalow on the property, a beautifully furnished private 2-bedroom villa, would be available upon my arrival for a one-month rental at a price I couldn’t refuse.As a note: The biggest benefit of traveling to Croatia in the low-season is that most rentals are heavily discounted. Sometimes up to 50% off. You’ll still get gorgeous weather and you will likely have the place to yourself.And so I arrived at Villa Dora, mouth agape as I took in the landscape of the property. It was even more beautiful than the photos. The main house was a perfectly pink shade that contrasted beautifully against the lush greenery that blanketed the balconies and gardens.The pool was sprinkled with sun-chairs & umbrellas and featured an unbelievable view of the sea down below. Even the gate leading down to the sea was charming in its own right.Peaking through the rod-iron gate, sailboats passed by and the glimmer of the sun reflected off the rippling water.There were also a few nice surprises tucked around the property. A small hidden area sat on the cliffside providing a panoramic view of the coastline. I would sit up there at sunset with a glass of wine and a book and practice the pleasure of doing nothing.Oh, and the sunsets at Villa Dora?wowzers…For the past month, my stay at Villa Dora has been unforgettable to say the least. I was finally able to unpack my bags, have my own kitchen, my own space and a place to do my laundry. I also had an address so that my mom could send me a care package.Anyone traveling for an extended period of time knows what a luxury that is!My private garden area (complete with BBQ!)About 80% of my time felt like full-blown summer. Sometimes too hot to even lay out my the pool! The other 20% was rainy or overcast but still warm. It was the perfect balance to stay focused on work and still enjoy my seaside paradise.By the beginning of October, there were no other guests at Villa Dora. I literally have had the place to myself. I would read down by the sea or bring my laptop down to the pool to get some writing done.Or, I’d laze around the villa all day in my OnePiece pajamas drinking coffee.It was perfect.Villa Dora is located in a great location for sightseeing around Croatia. I took a day-trip to the island of Krk for a seaside lunch and day on the beach. It was a short drive to spend a day in Trieste, Italy and grab a gelato and do some shopping.I even got the chance to visit the gorgeous waterfall-filled Plitvice Lakes and fulfill one of my biggest travel dreams.The owner, Renata, treated me like her own daughter. Even though I stayed to myself quite often to get work done, she always made sure I was taken care of. We’d share a laugh or a glass or wine. She helped me translate Croatian and gave me tips on the best things to see and do in the area. I’m so thankful for her hospitality.It really is incredible to have a deeper connection with the people and places you visit while abroad. Villa Dora will always hold a special place in my heart and I know I’ll return there again one day. Hopefully every year for that matter!More InformationHotel: Villa DoraLocation: Kraljevica, CroatiaAccommodation: Self-catering VillaPrice Range: $$$For more information or to book a stay, visit the Villa Dora website!"

After starting my adventures in Sweden, I’ve now been to 7 countries in the past 3 months.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-krka-national-park-croatia/,Tips for Visiting Krka National Park in Croatia,Croatia,"Updated: January 2020Krka National Park is one of Croatia’s best-known attractions, and the naturally colorful pools here provide a spectacular backdrop to relax with friends and to swim in the pristine waters.While I was planning my trip to Europe in summer 2014, which included running with the bulls in Pamplona, lounging on the beautiful beaches of Mykonos and exploring the ancient Acropolis in Athens, there was an opportunity to go sailing to the southern islands of Croatia with The Yacht Week.I had seen photos of Plitvice Lakes and Krka National Park on Pinterest and they were some of the most serene natural wonders I had ever seen. There were hundreds of waterfalls pouring into small pools that were as green as emeralds.It looked like something out of Peter Pan’s Never Never Land. I thought to myself, “I’ve seen some pretty stunning places in my life, but there’s no way this place is real.” But Krka does exist, and it’s prettier than any picture does it justice.Here’s my experience visiting Krka National Park in Croatia! Getting to Krka National ParkOn my way to The Yacht Week, I flew into Split, Croatia and allowed for a few days of sightseeing before setting sail. I walked around town to do some research with local tour operators and I came to find out that Plitvice was a 12-hour day trip from Split.*Heart crushed*BUT, I then was told that Krka National Park was much closer, and so I decided to do a day trip to Krka National Park with Adriatic4You that included a tour of the historic town of Šibenik (say the Š like shh, so it is pronounced Shi-beh-nick).If you’d like to make the trip to Krka on your own, you can grab a daily bus from the Split Airport or the Split Bus Station to Sibenik—the trip will take you about 1 hour and 40 minutes—and from Sibenik, you can then take a bus to Skradin, a town just outside the park.At Skradin, you can embark on one of the ferry excursions of the Park.If you’re arriving from other parts of Croatia, you’ll want to make your way to Sibenik and then travel on to Skradin and Krka National Park from there. Visiting Krka National ParkWe left bright and early in the morning and I was pleasantly surprised to be spending the tour with an awesome guide named Darijo. Along our drive to Šibenik, he filled us in on all of the destinations we were passing by, like the city of Trogir, and gave us a wealth of information on the history of Croatia and Dalmatia—the region of Croatia we were in which is on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea.We arrived at Šibenik (a UNESCO World Heritage site) and toured the Cathedral of St. James. The cathedral is unique in that it is a fusion of both Renaissance and Gothic art. Šibenik was also one of the first cities to have electric street lights—even before major cities like London, Paris, Munich, and Barcelona!After spending a short time in Šibenik, we drove about 20km to our final destination, Krka National Park. Arriving at the park was a bit unremarkable because it merely looked like any other nature reserve, but that all changed once we began our hike.Even before getting to the biggest waterfalls, the beautiful water was flowing all around us.We were guided by Darijo through one of the many trails in the park where we learned about the magic and wonder of the incredible natural phenomena Krka and Plitvice. While Plitvice is more well known and is a more popular tourist destination, there is little difference between the two other than in size.What is so fascinating about these lakes, caves, and waterfalls (aside from incredible natural beauty) is that they are formed from calcium carbonate, or limestone, which becomes travertine which only grows about 1 cm each year.You can imagine just how long these beauties have been quite literally growing!Once we reached a fairly high vantage point, Darijo stepped aside to reveal the incredible Scradinski Buk Waterfall. Far down below, there was a footbridge that crossed the lake where people were swimming at the base of the waterfall! It was one of the most impressive sights I’ve ever seen.I was mildly distracted from the rest of the tour on the hike.I couldn’t wait to jump in that impressive green and blue colored water! We finished the tour after learning that there are over 860 species of flora and many endemic, rare and endangered species of fauna at Krka National Park.We had plenty of free time to explore further trails and take a dip at the base of the Scradinski buk waterfall. I was stripped down to my bikini and splashing around before I even had time to think about my iPhone in my hand.So here’s your reminder to pack a waterproof phone case… wink wink. Other Helpful TipsSo, needless to say, Krka National Park did not disappoint. I learned some important lessons thanks to this natural wonder:Do Your ResearchIf you’re interested in doing a day tour like I did, do your research on the best company and tour ahead of time. If you aren’t able to, you’ll find many local tour companies in Split that you can talk to in person!Bigger Isn’t Always BetterJust because a place is more well known or traveled does not make it better! I didn’t miss out on anything by going to Krka instead of Plitvice on this trip. I would have been completely bummed to not be able to jump in the gorgeous waters at Plitvice, not to mention I would have spent a lot more time and money getting there from Split.Stuff HappensKeep a positive outlook and try to look beyond the moment. Nothing is as big of a deal in hindsight—even if you get something stolen, get lost, or drown your electronics!Protect YourselfYet again, phones and water do not mix. Wear protection. Get a LifeProof case and a dry bag for your clothes. I ended up visiting Krka a second time, two years later, and road tripped to visit the incredible Plitvice Lakes as well—check out my experience!

Situated in the temperate climate zone, Hungary experiences all four seasons, from warm summers to drier colder months.Depending on what activities you’re looking to do, there’s the right season for everyone when visiting Hungary. This guide helps break up the best time to travel to a country that is extremely rich in culture. And if you just so happen to wind up in Budapest during the holidays, the Christmas markets should not be missed!Here are the best times to travel to Hungary!  April to MaySpring in Hungary means wildflowers blooming everywhere, the crowds have yet to arrive, and the sun is shining. After the chilly winter months, come April, the temperatures average anywhere between 67-72 degrees F, making for the perfect time to explore the Hungarian countryside, especially by bike.This is also one of the best times to visit Budapest, as the tourists are still at home, giving you time to explore the city at your leisure. If you’re feeling adventurous, bike across the countryside from Budapest, traveling along the Danube Bend near Visegrad. Oh, and the thermal baths are an absolute MUST (though they’re wonderful all year).Regardless of where you visit, just remember to pack an umbrella as the weather can be unpredictable during the month of May.   June to AugustMuch like many other destinations in Europe, Hungary’s summer is peak season. The weather gets warm without becoming swelteringly hot and kids are out of school meaning families flock to Hungary for a getaway.With the larger crowds comes higher price tags. Expect to pay more on hotels and tours. Budapest has been known to have prices double in the summer months! If you want to avoid paying those higher prices, book your tickets and accommodation in advance.Despite the summer crowds, this is a wonderful time to sit back with a beer and soak up the Neo-Gothic architecture of the cities. And while you’re there, you can’t forget to visit Főzdefeszt—a street food and beer celebration that typically takes place in June.If you’re not a big city person, head out to Lake Balaton and the town of Tihany. There’s nothing more magical than watching the fields of lavender blow in the summer breeze.  Matthias Church, Budapest, HungarySeptember to OctoberFall is another great time to visit if you’re looking for a quieter, cooler vacation.Come September, the summer crowds have started to trickle out and prices begin to drop once again. And while these all may seem like big reasons to go, if you aren’t convinced, then you need to see the countryside painted in fall colors.The best place to see these red and gold hues is along the National Blue Trail, Europe’s oldest long-distance path. Bukk and Matra are also particularly gorgeous during this time of year.If you’re like me and you enjoy the occasional glass of wine or two, fall is also the season of the grape season in Hungary. Go to Tokaj or Eger to sip on a few local wines.  November to MarchWhen most people think of vacationing in Hungary, they don’t think of doing so during the winter months. And while winter in Hungary can be slightly bleak with rain and cold weather, there are very few tourists and prices to accommodation are extremely low. If you’re looking to explore the bigger cities, this is the ideal to visit while on a budget.Escape the cold by visiting Budapest’s museums and castles or take the time to soak in one of Budapest’s 100 thermal baths. I highly recommend Széchenyi! And don’t forget to visit the Christmas markets where you’ll find plenty of delicious goodies and festive souvenirs.Make sure to check out this guide on how to spend 48 hours in Budapest in the winter! Have you ever been to Hungary? If so, what time of the year did you go?I’d love to hear in the comments below! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-hungary/,10 Local Foods to Try in Hungary,Hungary,"Does anything come to mind when you think of Hungarian food? Goulash, perhaps? Heading to Hungary soon and not sure where to sure start? Well, you’re going to want to come hungry to Hungary. 😉With dishes full of flavor thanks to paprika, bay leaf, onion, caraway, coriander, and other spices, once you try your first bite, you’re never going to want to stop eating. While I explored Budapest, I got to sample some of Hungary’s best offerings…and my goodness!Let’s dig in and explore 10 local foods to try in Hungary!GoulashGulyas or goulash is easily the most popular Hungarian dish, in fact, it’s one of the national dishes of the country! The dish is a soup or stew of meat and veggies that is typically seasoned with paprika and other spices. It’s the perfect meal for a cold Hungarian day.Paprikas CsirkeIf you’re looking to immerse yourself in a true paprika-heavy dish, this is the one for you.Named for the spice that is commonly used in the country, this dish consists of chicken covered in a paprika sauce along with a sweet or sour cream. Also known as chicken paprikash, it’s a chicken dish that is served with dumpling-like boiled egg noodles aka nokedli.Kürtoskalács   Sometimes known as chimney cakes, these cakes are a sweet dough that is shaped into cylindrical spirals and baked over charcoal before being coated with powder sugar, cocoa, nuts, coconut, or cinnamon. This unique pastry is very popular at weddings and Christmas markets.HalászléHalászlé aka fisherman’s soup is a hot, paprika-based river fish or carp soup. With its generous amount of paprika used, it’s arguably one of the hottest dishes native to Europe.Think you can handle the heat?RetesWhat would a trip to Hungary be without some strudel?Retes are strudel-shaped pastries filled with a sugar paste of apple or cherry. This Hungarian cake is just the right amount of sweetness and is used in every celebration in the Hungarian lowlands.   LangosLangos is a common street food found in Hungary. The deep-fried dough is similar to pizza except for the fact that rather than baked, it is fried in oil. Many people choose to add sour cream, yogurt, or mashed potatoes to the dough to create different variations. It can be topped with sour cream and cheese or simply just garlic and butter.Somlói GaluskaThis classic Hungarian dessert is a sponge cake made up of several layers of cake and custard that is then studded with raisins and soaked in either rum or sweet wine. The traditional way to present this dish is to scoop three balls of cake onto a plate and then garnish with whipped cream and some chocolate sauce.PalacsintaCrepes are extremely popular throughout Europe and it’s no different in Hungary.Palacsinta (or palatschinke) is a thin pancake similar to the French crepe. They are traditionally rolled with apricot, strawberry, or plum jam and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. You might also find variations with Nutella, apple sauce, or thick fruit jams.Toltott  KáposztaThere is an old saying in Hungary that dates back to around the 17th or 18th century—“Meat and cabbage are the coat of arms in Hungary,” and there’s a good chance it’s talking about this dish of stuffed cabbage.Although this saying is not used anymore, it still holds true. Cabbage rolls are one of the country’s national dishes and were served to the wealthy and poor alike. The cabbage is stuffed with a mix of flavorful onion, minced pork, rice, and plenty of seasoning and topped with sour cream.Turos CsuszaIf you’re a pasta lover like me, you’ll love Turos Csusza. Made up of homemade noodles, crumbled cheese, crispy bacon, and sour cream, these cheese noodles are the ultimate comfort food.BonusMeggylevesHow does a chilled sour cherry soup sound as an appetizer or a dessert? On warm summer nights, Hungarians indulge in Meggyleves to help cool off. Whether you choose to sip on this before your main entree or after a big meal, the sour cherry soup is not to be missed!DessertsHungarians take their dessert very seriously and while wandering the streets, you’re likely to find bakeries filled with trifles with cream and layered pastries. Some other popular ones I didn’t mention earlier include Dobostorta, Gerbeaud Slice, and Esterhazy Cake (just to name a few!).OverallPutting this list together already has my mouth watering and has me ready to book another trip to Budapest!

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-budapest/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Budapest,Hungary,"A city brimming with beautiful architecture, history, and unique cuisine, Budapest (pronounced Boo-Da-Pesht, not Boo-Da-Pest) might seem intimidating to those who have never visited before.While it’s been a favorite among Euro-travelers in the know for quite some time, the capital of Hungary is finally starting to catch the eye of adventurers from all over. And for good reason! From the thermal baths to the ruin bars to the delicious local dishes, Budapest is bound to exceed all of your expectations.Here are my 10 tips for your first trip to Budapest!  Széchenyi Thermal BathVisit  the BathsDid you know that there are 118 mineral pools in Budapest? 118!That gives you plenty of options to get your relaxation on. If you’re unsure of how to choose, start with Szechenyi Bath—Budapest’s largest, grandest, and busiest thermal bath. It also happens to be the city’s first bath, dating back to 1913. Gellert Bath is also a wonderful option if you’ve got more time.Most importantly though, don’t forget to pack a swimsuit!   Getting AroundBudapest is a very spread out city but despite that, getting around is extremely easy thanks to its metro system. The heart of the metro consists of 4 crisscrossing lines that take you basically everywhere you’ll want to see.Using the metro is also extremely cost-effective, with a single ticket costing about $1.68. You can buy a pack of 10 from the station or a newspaper stand, which costs about $1.40 a ticket. Go to the Ruins BarsA ruin bar is exactly what it sounds like, a pop-up bar in the ruins of an apartment, shop, or rooftop in the derelict Jewish quarter. They’re the perfect combination of a pub and a speakeasy. Along with cheap drinks, you’ll also find art installations, dance parties, and flea markets.If you feel like seeing where it all started, head to Szimpla Kert, the first-ever ruin bar that opened in 2001.  Join a Walking TourIf you want to see the city but don’t know where to begin, I’d suggest taking a walking tour of the city! Tours typically happen daily at 10:30 AM and 2:30 PM and depart from the Lion Fountain in Vorosmarty Square.You’ll visit typical sites like Gresham Palace and the Chain Bridge along with learning the history of the Jewish population and communism in the country.Understand  the MoneyAlthough Hungary is a part of the European Union, they have yet to adopt the Euro. Currently, 1 USD is equivalent to ~300 Hungarian Forint (HUG). Be aware that when you’re getting money, their 1,000 bill is equivalent to about $3.30.This tripped me up when I was there because I pulled out 50,000 HUF—but really it was about $160 USD. The conversion isn’t a super easy one to figure out on the fly!Helpful Tip:I’d suggest carrying some cash on you as a number of restaurants and shops do not accept cards.Explore Both Buda and PestThe city, along with its name, is split into two distinct halves. Buda is draped across the hills to the west of the Danube while Pest sprawls over the opposite side. Both are easily navigated by foot, tram, or metro.Back in the day, Buda was the traditional home of royalty and is still marked by the castle. Pest, on the other hand, was a commercial hub.   Sample the Local DishesMy one piece of advice is to come hungry to Hungary!Hungarian food might seem intimidating at first but once you try your first bite of goulash (beef, potatoes, and veggies), there’s a good chance you’ll fall in love. I got to sample some of the tastiest treats from a Budapest Christmas Market!Other famous dishes include Fisherman’s soup also known as Halaszle (a spicy soup paprika-based fish soup) and csirke paprikash (chicken simmered in a paprika and sour cream sauce).One of the best ways to taste your way around the city is by joining a food tour!My Recommendation: Make a trip to New York Café! While it’s more for warm drinks and small bites, the interior was absolutely gorgeous!Fun Fact: At the turn of the 20th century, it was the most beloved coffee house in all of Budapest!Visit  the Vintage ShopsHitting up the vintage shops in Budapest might not be on a lot of the guides, but it’s worth checking out the eclectic boutiques all around the city. Just make sure to save some space in your suitcase for your funky finds! Tipping is CustomaryUnlike other places in Europe, it is standard to tip your server at least 10% when at a sit-down eatery. Many restaurants include a 12.5% service fee or “szervidij” which counts as the tip so be sure to check the bill before you leave.At more casual spots, there might be a tip jar or you can round up to the nearest forint-bill denomination when paying the server.  48 Hours in Budapest in Winter Read More!Lots of Places Close on SundayMany restaurants are closed on Sundays so be sure to double-check the hours before you begin the trek to grab a bite. If it’s a fine-dining restaurant, there’s a good chance that it is closed on Mondays as well.Bonus: Take in the HistoryHungary is a country full of history and there are a lot of memorials and art pieces to honor those that lost their lives during the Holocaust and under the Nazi and Soviet Regime. Take some time to reflect on the artwork, the history, and the people.OverallBudapest is becoming more and more popular with European travelers and backpackers alike. The vibrant city is full of beautiful parks, incredible architecture, hip bars, and food that will have you leaving with your pants unbuttoned.Oh, and if you’re there in December—you don’t want to miss out on the Christmas markets!

After checking into the gorgeous Ritz-Carlton, Budapest, we headed out to see the view from Fisherman’s Bastion. We continued exploring throughout the day and ended the night with cocktails and a tour of the iconic ruin bars.The next day we took the trolley around the city, walked through the public plazas and wound up at the beloved, Széchenyi thermal bath. We stopped for a quick hot chocolate at the New York Café which is renowned for being the most beautiful café in the world.Finally, we made our way down to St. Stephen’s Basilica to watch the sunset from the tower. Once the sun was down, we walked through the bustling Christmas Market and enjoyed some delicious holiday treats!Budapest has some of the most beautiful architecture and city-scapes in the world!

https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-visit-the-christmas-markets-in-europe/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit the Christmas Markets in Europe,Hungary,"There’s nothing like visiting the Christmas markets in Europe during the holidays. Throughout Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and beyond, you will find the greatest Christmas markets in the world.Filled with twinkling lights and the heady aroma of holiday spices, these places are truly magical. And there’s no better way to experience the holiday season than on a river cruise.When I found out that Crystal Cruises does a Danube Christmas Markets cruise, I started packing. I have traveled through the Seychelles Islands as well as taken a Brazilian Holiday cruise (my first ever cruise) with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with cruises ever since.Cruising from Vienna, Austria, into Passau, Germany; Krems, Austria; and Bratislava, Slovakia, I saw some of the most breathtaking architecture I’ve ever seen in my life. And the markets! If you like to shop until you drop and explore foodie wonderlands, welcome to heaven.I fell head over heels in love with Austria on my European Christmas market tour. We started off at the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Vienna.With baroque architecture, this lavish former imperial residence would take your breath away at any time of year, and it is in its prime at Christmas.Next up, with chestnuts literally roasting on an open fire, Vienna’s most popular Christmas market, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz, delivers serious classic yuletide cheer at its 150+ stalls.In Austria, we also took a tour of the Salzburg Christmas Markets and the traditional markets of the Austrian Lake District. It was love at first sight with the little village of St. Gilgen. It was straight out of a storybook. With snow-capped mountains and icy lakes, the entire region is picture-perfect.Tagged the “most romantic market” in the region, the Christmas market in Passau, Germany, was my favorite. With its own unique flair, this place was everything I expected of a Christmas market and more.Of course, you can’t talk about Christmas without mentioning the food. So, for you foodies out there, head to the Bratislava Christmas Market. This Slovakia market delivers yummy dishes on an unprecedented scale.Ready to get in the holiday spirit? It’s time to start planning your own trip to visit the Christmas Markets in Europe."
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-spend-48-hours-in-budapest-in-the-winter/,How to Spend 48 Hours in Budapest in the Winter,Hungary,"Known widely for its rich history and breathtaking architecture, Budapest is one of the Danube’s greatest treasures. While it’s long been a favorite among Euro-travelers in the know, the capital of Hungary is finally starting to catch the eye of adventurers from around the planet.Exploring the continent’s greatest Christmas markets, I set off on a winter excursion to see the best of Central Europe. Without a ton of time in each city, I planned ahead to make the most of every minute.Looking for a non-stop adventure? Here’s how to spend 48 hours in Budapest in the winter.Day One in BudapestWasting no time, we went straight over to The Ritz-Carlton, Budapest to drop off our bags after arriving in the afternoon. Our hotel was absolutely gorgeous, of course, and our suite experience included a private driver to take us around the city.This was a huge asset that allowed us to maximize our time. If we had traveled by public transport or taxi, we would have never gotten to see so many places; I highly recommend considering this option if you can.The highlight of the first afternoon was Fisherman’s Bastion. The view from there is truly breathtaking and, like so many places in the city, the architecture is quite incredible.We spent WAY too much time taking photos of this place, but it is so reminiscent of Hogwarts, and I just couldn’t drag myself away.Overlooking the Danube, Gellért Hill is another place to get the perfect view of Budapest. We made it up just in time for sunset and the panoramic was unforgettable.After dark, we headed back to the Ritz-Carlton for dinner at Deák St. Kitchen. It was the perfect introduction to Hungarian cuisine, with the restaurant’s generous servings of fancy home-style food and amazing craft cocktails.To finish off the night we went on a tour of Budapest’s ruin bars. As the name implies, these places are in ruins (think dive bars taken to the next level, without losing the cool factor).You could easily spend two days just checking them all out but, if you’re in a time crunch, I’d head straight to the best ruin bar of the bunch, Szimpla Kert.If you’re not into bars, there’s plenty of other tours in Budapest that will let you explore the city’s fascinating history, castles, and food!Day Two in BudapestWe started the day at Heroes’ Square, locally known as Hősök tere, another one of the city’s lovely public plazas. From the square, the famous Széchenyi Thermal Bath is just a quick walk.Hungary is famous for its thermal baths, and this one is the most beloved of all. Prices start at 18 euros, and you can choose from a range of upgrades to create a soothing spa experience — plus, you can get skip the line passes here.Once we were feeling relaxed from the Széchenyi thermal bath, we took a quick walk over to the Vajdahunyad Castle to gawk at even more world-class architecture.You can opt to do a culinary walking tour to learn more about the rich culinary culture of the city, and have some treats!A must-see in Budapest, the New York Café is renowned for being the most beautiful café in the world, and it did not disappoint. We indulged ourselves with a hot-chocolate break at the café.Another quintessential Budapest experience is a stroll along the Danube. We started off at the Parliament building and explored the stunning riverside path, snapping photos every step of the way.Finally, we made our way down to St. Stephen’s Basilica to watch the sunset from the tower. It was an absolute stunner! I’d highly recommend timing your day so that you can watch the sun fall from the Basilica.After dark, the Christmas market outside of St. Stephen’s Basilica comes to life. Be sure to check out Kürtőskalács (AKA chimney cake). They are a super yummy traditional treat enjoyed during the holidays.There’s also a light show in the evening in front of St. Stephen’s, and it’s well worth sticking around to see.Day Three in BudapestAfter a couple of amazing, whirlwind days exploring Budapest, we needed a morning pampering session before another big day of travel. Luckily for us, staying at one of the world’s greatest hotels, we had a world-class spa right at our fingertips.Following our ultra-chill morning, The Ritz-Carlton, Budapest chauffeured us off to the airport, and we said “see you later!” to this beautiful Hungarian city.Recommended Tours for Budapest!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-stay-in-bali/,Where to Stay in Bali,Indonesia,"With lush green scenery, world-class surfing, a hip nightlife, and some of the best vegan food the planet, Bali is one of those places that I find myself coming back to time and time again.It’s the kind of island where you can choose your own adventure and have a completely different experience every single time. I love traveling Bali as a solo female and it’s ultra-romantic when you go a couple. Bali for budget travelers? It’s easy! When you are deciding where to stay in Bali, it is all about deciding what kind of experience you want to have.Just be careful of the traffic! People tend to think their traffic is the craziest in the world, but when the Balinese say it their traffic is worse—they mean it. During rush hour, it can take a solid hour just get to get 10 km (6.2 mi). Before you book a place, decide what your core interests are…and how long it will take to get to other areas.If you want to be near the beach, jungle, or yoga spaces most days, stay near them!Before you go, you will want a guide to each neighborhood in Bali and figure out what suits you. Here’s my guide on where to stay in Bali!   UbudIt’s all about the jungle vibes here! Close to the Monkey Forest, this is the lush region that you’ve definitely seen featured on Instagram from time to time. The sweeping rice paddies are dotted with shrines and waterfalls (with more than a few yoga centers in the mix).If you are looking for an area where you can get a glimpse of local life, this is one of the best options. In the heart of Ubud, you will also find the largest market in the area that is perfect for finding souvenirs.Read More:Top Things to See and Do in Ubud, Bali  CangguCangguCanggu my fave spots! Everything is super close together and it’s easy to walk around. It’s also a very safe area so it is one of my first recommendations for solo female travelers in Bali. For this very reason, you will also be able to meet other travelers too.There are lots of laid-back beach cafés and bars. If you’re into surfing, the main road in town, Batu Bolong, is the place to be. Keep your eye out for quiet little warungs (roadside cafés) all over and some of the coolest street art!Read More:The Ultimate Canggu Travel GuideSeminyakLooking for a swanky, upscale spot on the sand? You are going to love Seminyak. This is one of the biggest beach communities and you will have everything outside of your doorstep. Luxe resorts, high-end shopping, and sleek bars are the standard here.My fave areas to explore are the quirkier areas of Jalan Petitenget and Jalan Kayu Aya as well as the popular Eat Street. If you’re into surfing be sure to check out Petitenget and Seminyak beaches.    Jimbaran BayIf you are traveling with family, I’d highly recommend checking out Jimbaran Bay.It is a lovely mix of a luxury resort with local communities. The water is calm in the bay and there are plenty of spots to try ultra-fresh seafood or just lounge by the water. For an afternoon on the town, browse the local market. While Jimbaran Bay can get a bit crowded, it isn’t as touristy as some other spots.   UluwatuIf you are in Bali to just unwind, you are going to love Uluwatu. It is one of the quieter spots in the southern part of the island and it’s stunning. You can choose between a well-appointed resort or a quiet villa on the coast.Plan a day to walk up to Uluwatu Temple for a panoramic view. This area is known for its lush green surroundings and sparkling turquoise sea.   Tegalalang Rice TerraceTegalalangOdds are you’ve seen pics of the beautiful Tegalalang rice terraces before. Travelers often pop over to take a few photos and spend a night or two. I’d recommend sticking around for a bit longer though in this underrated area.Wherever you stay, get up early at least one morning for a sunrise hike up Mt Batur! Not RecommendedWhile I love Bali, there are a few spots that are simply not worth it. Out of the way or out of touch with what makes the island incredible, these neighbors are on my “miss” list.KutaKnown for the backpacker crowd, you can find a cheap place to stay here BUT Bali is not an expensive travel destination. There’s no sense in staying in a crazy area to save a couple of dollars. The tourist packs can be overwhelming here compared to the more chill backpacker vibe you will find in Canggu or Seminyak.SanurThis is a family-oriented spot without a lot to do. It has a rather sleepy reputation and it can take quite a bit of time to get to other places. While there are resorts with nice places to relax, the main beaches aren’t very well maintained.AirportUnless you are leaving in the early morning, it’s not worth spending the night in the airport area. There is very little to do nearby and it is not a walkable area. If you find a nice hotel and are happy to just hang out there, it’s fine for the night but it’s not a long-term destination.Ready to pack your bikini and go? Here’s my Ultimate Bali Travel Guide!"

The waterfalls here are incredible, especially Tumpak Sewu, which is considered one of the best in Indonesia.    LombokLombok is another small island off the coast of Bali that deserves a spot on any Indonesia itinerary.

If you don’t feel comfortable driving yourself, you can use the GO-JEK app for an Uber-like service but on the back of a motorbike.Taxis are the most expensive (but still cheap). I recommend using the Blue Bird app for hailing rides. You’ll Need CashCash is king in Bali. Always carry a handful of 10,000 to 100,000 notes (valued from $0.75 to USD 7.50) for daily expenses and haggling. It’s only the more Western, upmarket restaurants and shops that will accept payment with credit card. If you’re shopping at the markets or eating at the local warungs, you’ll need to pay with cash.While there are plenty of ATMs around Bali, always check to see if the bank you’re withdrawing from accepts foreign bank cards.Read More: The Ultimate Bali Travel Guide Explore Beyond UbudBali is more than Seminyak and Ubud.

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-get-from-gili-trawangan-to-lombok/,How to Get from Gili Trawangan to Lombok,Indonesia,"One of the best parts of being in the Gili Islands is the ability to island hop. Getting from Gili Trawangan to Lombok will only take you about 35 minutes though there are a few different boat options, some that take longer but can be fun if you want to live like a local and have the time to spare.Here are my recommendations on how to get from Gili T to Lombok!Public Boats from Gili T to LombokThe first boat is the public one that leaves from the main beach of Gili T. It departs at 7:30 in morning or 4:00 in the afternoon. It’s also the cheapest option and will only cost you less than $1 USD. However, expect a long ride.You’ll find the ticket office right on the shore, and it’s open from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. The touts will likely try to pursue you to let them carry your bags but beware this is not a free service. If it is something that you are interested in, be sure to negotiate the price in Rupiah and not dollars.Shuttle Boats from Gili T to LombokShuttle boats are another option that leaves from Gili T. They operate twice a day at 8:15 AM and 4:30 PM. A ticket will cost you IDR 25,00 (less than $1 USD).If you have a larger group, you can charter a shuttle boat for up to 10 people for IDR 225,000 ($14 USD). Keep in mind that prices do begin to go up after dark.Speed Boat to  Teluk  NaraLocated on the west side of Lombok, there are two fast boat terminals, Teluk Kodek and Teluk Nara. Most travelers head to Teluk Nara, the quieter harbor of the two.From Gili T to Teluk Nara, it will be about a 10-minute speedboat ride, so it’s one of the quicker options if you are in a rush or don’t feel like waiting for the ferry!Public Ferry from Gili T to LombokFerries are difficult because they fill up extremely quickly. If you’re late, you may be unable to find a seat. It will only cost you IDR 10,000 ($0.66 USD) to get to Lombok, so it’s worth the bargain as long as you’re patient.It will take about 45 minutes to complete the journey, and they typically don’t stick to a rigid schedule so it can be a bit tricky trying to catch one.On Gili T, there are small ferry boat provider stands where you can take little day trips. Just be sure to bring cash so you can get from one place to another.Private Speedboat from Gili T to LombokIf all of this sounds like too much, there are ways to charter a private speedboat. If you’re traveling with a larger group (5+ people), this might be a good idea.The Lombok Network allows you to charter a speedboat for five people for $132 USD one way. It also includes airport transfer in case you are going straight from Gili T to the Lombok airport.You can also show up at one of the ports and see if you can negotiate a price with one of the outrigger boats. It can be an extremely scenic ride depending on the day, and it’s a great way to island hop and snorkel.In ConclusionIf you’re island hopping, it’s much easier to get to Lombok from Gili T rather than Bali, especially in the winter (specifically January and February) when the water is extremely choppy. Thankfully, there are so many different ways to get to and from the islands.The best advice is to look at your itinerary and look at how much time you want to spend in each place, then decide which transportation method is best for you! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-south-lombok-in-indonesia/,Exploring South Lombok in Indonesia,Indonesia,"With panoramic views of the bay, there’s a reason South Lombok will leave you speechless. Lombok is a small island off the East coast of Bali, in Indonesia. With blindingly white sand and crystal clear water, this tiny island is known for its dive sites and surfing.Since the airport opened in 2011, the island has become more accessible than ever. Kuta, the main town off the southern coast of Lombok, has blossomed with new hotels, cafes, and restaurants, and has quickly become the perfect spot for your next vacation.Here is my guide to exploring South Lombok in Indonesia!Where to Stay in LombokDuring my visit, I stayed in Kuta. It’s neighbor, Bali, has a beach also named Kuta so don’t get the two mixed up because they are very different.In South Lombok, you’ll find coffee shops, bungalows, endless amounts of Mediterranean food, and plenty of surfing. You’ll also find a few lodging options to choose from.Lamancha Homestay: Lamancha is only a 4-minute walk from the beach and contains ten rooms filled with colorful tiles and tapestries. Each room has a terrace with garden views, and you can enjoy an a la carte or halal breakfast while you enjoy the warm air.Bombora Bungalows: The rooms are in fact bungalows, and the Bombora Bungalows offer many amenities such as free wifi, housekeeping, balconies, and a gorgeous pool that you can spend your days in. The best part is that rooms start at $24 a night.Surfer’s Inn: Surfer’s Inn was built following the local architectural style with a lot of colors. There are 25 rooms, a swimming pool, a bar, and a restaurant. Plus the rooms start at only USD $14 a night, and is also close to the beach.Doyok Homestay: The minute you fly into Lombok International Airport, Doyok Homestay offers direct transportation, making your trip extremely easy. The rooms include a terrace, a seating area, and gorgeous tile or marble flooring.You’ll also be able to enjoy pancakes while looking out at the beach. Doesn’t get much better than that!Pipes Hostel: Pipes Hostel is Kuta Lombok’s first hostel and is extremely popular. There are four different types of rooms including an 8-bed mixed dorm, a 7-bed mixed dorm, and a 12-bed mixed dorm.It is quiet, laid back and is situated near some great surfing spots. There’s also a swimming pool and a skate park on the property.Same Same Bungalows: The Same Same Bungalows will have you feeling like Lombok is your home in no time. There is free breakfast every morning and a garden to spend your days in. They also set up tours and surf lessons around the island for you.How to Get Around LombokWhen in Lombok, you’ll absolutely want to rent a motorbike. It’s a necessity! Luckily there are motorbike rentals all over the island. If you’re staying at Same Same, they offer some. If not, there are also many bike rental spots all over. However, do your research before renting. There have been some scams reported before!Where to Explore in South LombokLet’s be honest, visiting South Lombok is all about visiting the beaches. Here are some of my favorites!Tanjung Aan: This is one of my absolute favorite beaches in Lombok. Located 20 minutes east of Kuta, you’ll find two bays made up of incredibly white sandy beaches. In between, there is a viewpoint of the two coves that offers a 360-degree view of both coves. It’s one of the best spots to watch the sunset.There are also a few warungs nearby that offer delicious food and drink. If you do purchase something, many of them offer lounge chairs and umbrellas that you can use on the beach for free.And if you’re in the mood for a snack, look for people selling mini pineapples. They’re extremely sweet and juicy!Kuta Beach: Kuta Beach has 7.2km of crystal clear coastline. It’s the perfect place for beach activities like snorkeling, surfing, or sunbathing. There is a hill called Mandalika Hill that is the best spot to enjoy the scenery of the beach. In fact, the water is so clear, you can see a variety of underwater life.Mawi Beach: If you’re an experienced surfer, Mawi Beach is the best place to catch some waves while you’re visiting South Lombok. With the coral reefs, sharp rocks, and strong currents, the waves are fast making them a bit harder for beginners. There is no public transportation to the beach so you’ll want to have your motorbike ready to go.Selong Belanak Beach: Selong Belanak can be said as one of the most prestigious beaches on Lombok. It’s extremely clean and well-kept. There are usually many fishing boats out on the water so it is recommended that if you’re going to do any swimming or water sports, stay on the north side of the beach.The waves are small and the water is sparkling clean making it the ideal place to spend a beach day and relax.Lombok is such a fun little island to explore if you are traveling through the region! It is on the calmer side when coming from Bali, which makes it the perfect place for some true relaxation. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/scuba-diving-with-trawangan-dive-in-gili-t/,Scuba Diving with Trawangan Dive Centre in Gili T,Indonesia,"During my trip to Indonesia, I got to scuba dive in Gili Trawangan, a tiny island off the coast of Indonesia. From incredible sea life to crystal clear water and a luxurious resort and dive shop, it was a diver’s paradise.Here is my experience scuba diving with Trawangan in Gili T!Getting ThereThe only way to get to Gili T is to take a speedboat. Many fast boat operations are running directly between Bali and Gili Trawangan. You’ll either leave from Serangan or Padang Bai, depending on the area of Bali you are coming from.Motorized vehicles are not permitted on the island so during your stay you have three choices; you can walk, ride a bike, or take a horse-drawn cart.Staying at  Trawangan Dive CentreTrawangan Dive Centre not only offers diving, but accommodation tucked away in a tropical garden. On-site, you’ll find two swimming pools, a swim-up bar, sun-beds on the beach, beach dining, the dive center, and shop.They ensure you have a warm welcome with a free welcome beverage to start your vacation off right.There are different types of accommodation for all travelers:The Luxury Rooms come with a furnished terrace in a large gated garden, a fresh hot water shower, a mini bar, and a buffet breakfast at the resort restaurant ‘Fat Cats.’22 Standard Rooms provide a comfortable stay for an affordable budget. They’re very similar to the luxury rooms and include the buffet breakfast and the furnished terrace. However, it won’t be in the gardens.The Sea View Family Room is perfect for parties with 4-5 guests. You have a spacious room with a queen sized bed and an additional bedroom with two twin beds. You’ll still get a fully furnished balcony with beachfront views and includes breakfast for up to 4 guests.Lastly, the Economy Rooms are a bit smaller, meant for two people. You’ll still have a terrace and a small gated garden along with the buffet breakfast.Even if you aren’t staying at Trawangan Dive, you can still hang out on the property and enjoy the swim-up bar and restaurant!Diving Around Gili TTrawangan Dive is a PADI (Professional Association of Diving Instructors) 5-Star Resort meaning you will find PADI dive shops and PADI dive professionals to help you on your dives.They offer PADI courses, fun dives, and tech dives. Since I recently topped up my PADI courses with Nitrox certification in French Polynesia and my Advanced Open Water Diving Certification in Mexico, I was here for as much fun diving as I could fit into my schedule.Scuba Diving is one of my favorite solo travel activities, and since I came to Gili T on my own, I went diving twice a day for about five days in a row!While I didn’t do any Technical training, I was impressed with the facilities and professionalism of their instructors. I’d highly recommend Trawangan Dive if you’re looking to take any PADI courses.Fun Dive PricingACTIVITYPRICE PER DIVE (IDR)PRICE PER DIVE (USD)Guided Boat DiveIDR 490,000$33Nitrox Guided Boat DiveIDR 620,000$42Night DiveIDR 600,000$40PADI Course PricingACTIVITYPRICE PER COURSE (IDR)PRICE PER COURSE (USD)PADI Open WaterIDR 5,500,000$370PADI Advanced Open WaterIDR 4,500,000$300PADI Rescue DiverIDR 5,500,000$370Dive Sites in the Gili IslandsTrawangan Dive takes guests to sites throughout the Gili Islands. Most sites range in depth from 10 meters to 40 meters and are mainly coral gardens, coral ridges, and walls. All sites are accessible within 10 to 15 minutes by boat, so you can do multiple dives each day.One of my favorite things about diving with them is that groups are kept small (maximum of 4 divers per guide).Here are some of the sites I dived during my stay on Gili T!Japanese WWII Wreck: The Hayabusa Maru was sunk in 1945 off the coast of Lombok and is home to corals and many species of fish. It’s a fun and unique spot to dive. Highlights include bullets, a captains quarters, and propeller. Max Depth: 45M | Advanced Open Water + NitroxHalik: Halik is an excellent spot for all divers with dives starting at 6m and going down to 40m. There are a lot of different caves that sea life like to hang out in, especially sharks. You’ll also likely see triggerfish, snapper, and rays. Max Depth: 30M | Open WaterTurtle Heaven: Turtle Heaven is exactly what it sounds like. It has a healthy population of hard corals which make for loads of food for turtles and fish. It’s a great spot for divers who are just starting out. Max Depth: 32M | Open WaterDeep Turbo: Deep Turbo is a spot for those who are a bit more advanced in diving.  Massive coral pinnacles peak out of the white sand. Bluespotted rays are often seen floating around looking for clams. Due to the current, the drift diving is said to be incredible. You’ll find many unexpected animals from the deep sea. Max Depth: 32M | Advanced Open WaterGili Meno Wall: If you’re looking to try something new, Gili Meno Wall is an ideal spot for night dives. The current is very unpredictable ranging from nonexistent to the strongest on the island, which means the sea life also varies. You might find scorpionfish, moray eels, lobsters, and crabs. Max Depth: 25M | Open Water | Night DiveSimon’s Reef: Simon’s Reef is another spot for more advanced divers. Reef canyons spread across the site bringing in large schools of fish and animals. Max Depth: 40M | Advanced Open WaterSeahorse Bay: Seahorse Bay is an amazing site for muck diving (diving that gets its name from the sediment that lies on the ocean floor). It’s by far the best spot for night diving. If you keep an eye out, you might even see some octopus, hairy frogfish, and pygmy seahorses. Max Depth: 35M | Advanced Open WaterShark Point: One of the most popular dive sites in the Gili Islands, this is the perfect spot for divers of all levels. You’ll find schools of jackfish, sharks and a tugboat wreck at 30 meters. Heading closer to shore, the site shallows to as low as 5m, where you’ll find tons of sea turtles swimming through rolling coral fields. Max Depth: 40M | Open WaterIt’s easy to see why Gili Trawangan was one of my favorite dive centers to dive with (ever). After diving in over 12 different countries around the world, the Gili Islands stand as one of the best places to scuba dive in the world!Note from Gili T Dive Centre: (Updated Sept 29, 2018) We were very lucky that we sustained minimal damage to the resort as a result of the earthquake and were able to open up for businesses on the 1st of September. While there is some evidence on the island of recent events, the main roads have been cleared, any dangerous buildings removed and the island has had a huge cleanup. We think that this is an amazing time to visit the Gili Islands as the diving is wonderful, the beaches are stunning and crowd-free. Any visitors will also be helping to restore the economy for the north Lombok region as many people lost their homes as a result of the events."

https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-visit-raja-ampat/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Raja Ampat,Indonesia,"Raja Ampat is an archipelago of about 1,500 remote islands located in Indonesia’s West Papua province, and is known for the beautiful beaches, pristine coral reefs, and turquoise waters. It is part of the “Coral Triangle” which is considered the global center of marine biodiversity, and has the richest marine life I’ve ever seen while diving.So, what better place to do my first diving liveaboard trip than Raja Ampat?!Because of how remote the islands and reefs are, and with no airports close by, these islands are best discovered by boat.I spent 12 magical days onboard the Samambaia Liveaboard and completed a whopping 28 dives throughout the 12 day cruise. If you love diving, this is a bucket list scuba diving destination!In between dives, we had the opportunity to explore the beautiful lagoons of Raja Ampat and the protected Misool Marine Reserve which protects 300,000 acres of the world’s richest reefs. We hopped on a speedboat to snorkel some smaller reefs and admire the gorgeous, white sand beaches.All of the islands are stunning, and I would love to have more time to explore them in the future. If you’re visiting anywhere in Southeast Asia, this is a great excursion to add onto your trip.Seeing Raja Ampat by sea is something I will never forget! ﻿"
https://theblondeabroad.com/diving-raja-ampat-with-samambaia-liveaboard/,Diving Raja Ampat with Samambaia Liveaboard,Indonesia,"After years of diving, I finally did my first liveaboard! In partnership with LiveAboard.com, I crossed a huge bucket list diving trip and an Indonesian dream route off my list.In case you’ve never heard of it, a liveaboard “cruise” offers divers the opportunity to stay onboard overnight, unlike a day trip, and allows time to travel to more distant dive sites that may not be otherwise accessible.I spent 11 nights and 12 days at sea on the Samambaia Liveaboard diving Raja Ampat and the Banda Sea. Thanks to the experienced, knowledgeable crew, I had an incredible time indulging my mermaid side.Ready to find your sea legs? Here’s what it’s like diving Raja Ampat with the Samambaia Liveaboard. MV SamambaiaFor the diving excursion of a lifetime, we stayed onboard this beautiful wooden boat, which had six cabins and a master cabin. The vessel can accommodate up to 14 guests at one time.The rooms are made with beautiful woodwork, and have a built-in AC unit. All bathrooms offer a rain shower/hand shower combo which feels amazing after a dive!The main deck of the MV Samambaia is comprised of the master cabin, the wheelhouse, the dining room and lounge area and the dive deck, with a sun deck on the upper deck. The boat also offers complimentary Wi-Fi during certain journeys — your connectivity all comes down to how remote the area is.Exploring the Raja Ampat Islands will have you (blissfully) disconnected.Helpful Tip: Some of the rooms can accommodate a third person if you’re traveling with a child. Diving in Raja Ampat and the Banda SeaThe local dive guides onboard Samambaia made the experience truly exceptional. They’re experienced divers who are knowledgeable about every dive site, currents and the local marine life, so their pre-dive briefs were super helpful.The crew was very safety-conscious. They always ensured that procedures were followed to keep us safe on and off the boat. On top of that, the crew is an all-around fun group who make the trip one for the books.The liveaboard offered diving equipment for rent, so if you haven’t purchased your own gear, or don’t have enough room in your luggage, Samambaia has great rental options. As a bonus, they offered Nitrox for free to all of the Nitrox-certified divers.I have been diving in some of the most stunning destinations around the world, and I would love to do a full Raja Ampat liveaboard (North and South) in the future, but my time in the Banda Sea was in a class of its own. A few of my favorite dives were Manuk Island or “Bird Island”, where there are hundreds of sea snakes, and in Ambon, where you’ll find world-class muck diving. Food + DrinkAll of the meals, non-alcoholic drinks and beer are complimentary onboard. So, you never have to worry about going hungry during the trip. Every morning, we were able to order our choices for breakfast so they were ready after the morning dive, and we enjoyed a set two-course lunch and a set three-course dinner each day. The meals were varied, and the crew happily catered to dietary needs.On top of the complimentary offerings, there was also wine available for purchase or one could BYOB with a corkage fee. There are no spirits (hard alcohol) available for purchase onboard, so you’re able to bring your own without a corkage fee. Activities + ExcursionsIn between dives, we had the opportunity to explore the beautiful lagoons of Raja Ampat via speedboat and/or kayak. On excursion days, we hopped on a speedboat to snorkel some smaller reefs and admire gorgeous, white sand beaches.The Banda Islands have a long and fascinating history of spice production, and one of our trips on land gave us the opportunity to explore one of the charming little island towns on Banda Neira island.Every route has different activities and excursions, so there is always something new to experience! Other Samambaia Liveaboard DestinationsThe MV Samambaia is one of the courses with the best diving. Depending on the season, the boat takes different routes around Indonesia to get the most ideal diving and weather conditions.You can choose between routes through Raja Ampat, Komodo Islands, Alor and the Banda Sea. They’re all good options, so the best pick just depends on when you want to go. My Personal ExperienceThis was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I’d love to turn into a regular part of my diving calendar! Given the option, I’d do the complete Raja Ampat cruise with both the north and south options.All of the islands are stunning, and I would love to have more time to explore them. Interested in booking your own Indonesian liveaboard adventure?

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-ayana-resort-and-spa-in-bali/,Staying at the AYANA Resort and Spa BALI,Indonesia,"When I try to picture a tropical paradise, Bali is one of the first places that comes to my mind. With lush forests, sweeping rice fields, picture perfect beaches, and amazing diving, this stunning Indonesian islands is easily one of my favorite escapes.Bali really is one of those places that has something for everyone. From surf hostels with non-stop parties to gorgeous luxury retreats, Bali has got you covered. On my latest Balinese adventure, I treated myself to a five-star experience.Here’s what it was like staying at the AYANA Resort and Spa BALI!Getting to AYANA ResortThe AYANA Resort and Spa BALI has a prime cliff-top location over Jimbaran Bay, just six miles from the airport. While it feels a million miles from anywhere, it’s actually a really central spot.And Bali is an easy place to get around. You can bike, walk, or catch a ride. You’ll find taxis all over the island, along with bemo buses, which are basically public minibuses. AYANA also offers a resort shuttle so transport is totally worry-free from there.The HotelUnder the AYANA name, you’ve actually got a few different options. There’s AYANA Resort and Spa BALI and The Villas at AYANA. I first visited the resort back in 2011, and this was the first time I’d been back to check it out.In the past six years, it’s developed into a massive resort. While I normally prefer smaller, boutique accommodation, AYANA is tasteful and really beautiful.In fact, AYANA has the most extensive on-site resort facilities anywhere Bali. With a 19 restaurants, 12 swimming pools, and 290 chic rooms, this is the ideal spot to come if you want a stress-free place that will give you everything at your fingertips (and who doesn’t need a vacation like that every so often?).If you’re in the mood for a more exclusive and intimate experience, I’d recommend The Villas at Ayana. There are 78 massive villas with private pools and 24-hour butler service.And, when I say this place is luxe, I mean seriously luxe. Over the last 60 years, fewer than 175 resorts in the world have received a 5-star rating from Forbes Travel Guide and this impressive place has made the list.The RoomsAt AYANA, you’ve got the option between club rooms (515 sq ft) and suites (1054 sq ft), both offering either an ocean or garden view.All of the rooms feature four-poster canopy beds, marble bathrooms, and balconies while the suites feature a separate living area, two full bathrooms, oversized balconies, and a deep stand-alone soaking bathtub. I stayed in an ocean view suite at AYANA and the view of the Indian Ocean was incredible.A massive space full of little luxury touches, it felt more like a home than a hotel room.The FoodWith 19 restaurants, you won’t go hungry at AYANA. Specializing in steak and ultra fresh seafood, DAVA is good for dinner and the Rock Bar is definitely a must-see too.It has a striking sunset view plus tasty tapas and Mediterranean food. In addition, they’ve also got Mexican, Italian, Japanese, and pretty much any other international and Balinese cuisine you might be in the mood for.Their nearby sister property, RIMBA Jimbaran BALI by AYANA, is really cool as well. They’ve got a lovely Sunday brunch and a Rooftop Bar & Restaurant with Mexican food and cocktails.ActivitiesYou could have a dream vacation without ever leaving the AYANA Resort. That said, the surrounding area of Uluwatu is worth exploring. If you’re a surfer, this place is heaven.Ever since the 70s, Uluwatu has been popular with travelers looking for epic waves. If you’re a pro, check out Padang Padang Left. Newbies and intermediates should stick with Padang Padang Right.The other big thing in the area is Uluwatu Temple or the Pura Luhur Uluwatu as the locals call it. It’s got a picture-perfect location on top of a dramatic cliff.It’s also packed with monkeys- and watch out for them! They are famous for stealing tourists’ stuff and, often, these smart guys demand you give them fruit if you want to get your stuff back.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> More InformationHotel: AYANA Resort & Spa BaliLocation: Jimbaran Bay, BaliAccommodation: Resort, LuxuryPrice Range: $$$Thanks to AYANA Resort and Spa BALI for hosting me during my stay.

If you end up going to Indonesia in the winter though, you can still have a great dive.The rainy season runs from December to February and is the prime time to see manta rays. The underwater visibility from November to January is exceptionally good too so don’t write off diving just because you are there during the colder months.Be sure to find a dive spot that matches your experience level.Some areas have strong currents and aren’t safe for newbies.

They’ve both got a really knowledgeable and helpful staff.Most dive companies offer day tours of the local hot spots.You’ll have a choice between three dive sites or two dives with a Komodo dragon viewing at Rinca. I went on a private charter so we dived in locations you most likely wouldn’t see on one of the day tours. On the big day, I dove Pink Beach, Manta Point, and Batu Bolong.Pink Beach was actually very green and murky the day we went but the coral was still incredible. I missed the mantas at Manta Point but it was still a super interesting dive site to explore. My favorite spot was definitely Batu Bolong.With countless fish and stunning coral, Batu Bolong was the most epic diving I’ve ever seen.Top Dive SitesSabolonBatu BolongLangkoi RockCastle RockSiaba Kecil (drift dive)Karang Makassar / Manta PointLiveaboards in KomodoIf you’d rather spend more than a day or two diving, you can find some of the best diving liveaboard experiences in Komodo.

Far from the wild nights of Bali, this quiet group of islands is home to white-sand beaches, lush hiking parks, and world-class snorkeling and diving.With so much to do in Komodo National Park, it’s well worth the trip from Bali!The center of the park is a world away from the hustle and bustle of Bali, but you can get there in just ninety minutes from Denpasar.Many companies offer day tours out of Labuan Bajo, so you can easily explore the hills of Padar, chill with the dragons on Komodo Island, relax on Pink Beach, and snorkel at Manta Point. I went with Ora Dive—they offer custom tours and packaged day trips so you can choose what you’d like to see the most!Check out my day trip to Komodo Island, Padar and Pink Beach!Book Your Day TripThere are great tour companies that offer day trips to Padar, Komodo Island, Pink Beach, and Manta Point. The trip starts early (around 5:30 a.m.!) from Labuan Bajo, so you’ll definitely want to start your day near the tour meeting point.Plan to fly into Labuan Bajo the day before your day trip.There are seven flights per day, so it’s easy to find one that’ll work with your schedule. Labuan Bajo is one of the biggest city in Flores, which means you’ll have no problem finding things to do or places to stay there. However, I’d definitely recommend Le Pirate Flores—it’s super cute and in a great location.There are lots of places around Labuan Bajo where you can get a glimpse into the culture of the local Manggarai people. They are known for their ultra impressive weaving, so check out the textiles if you’re looking for a unique souvenir.Read More: The Ultimate Flores Island Travel Guide1st Stop: PadarGrab your hiking shoes! The view from the peaks of Padar Island is the most beautiful sight in Indonesia. Climb your way to the top for a panorama view of the incredible natural beauty of Komodo National Park. Don’t forget lots of sunscreen and a hat — it’s a hot and sunny adventure to the top.The hike is a bit of a challenge but it’s worth it. 2nd Stop: Komodo IslandAn official UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Man and the Biosphere Program Reserve, Komodo Island is a remarkable place. Home to fewer than 2,000 people and an impressive 2,500 Komodo dragons, this is the place to reconnect with nature.While there are no guaranteed sightings, there are usually some Komodo dragons hanging out by the buildings near the entrance, so arrive ready for a quick selfie with a local lizard. 3rd Stop: Pink BeachThe world-famous Pink Beach is a must-see for any visitor to Komodo National Park. With soft, pink sand, crystal clear waves, and amazing diving spots, Pink Beach is a place you’ve got to visit. You will most likely have enough time here to eat lunch, snorkel and hike up the nearby hill for a great view looking over the beach.While still stunning, this hot spot is not as pink as it once was because people like to take the sand. Please don’t take the sand! Not only will your sand get thrown away when you go through airport security, you’ll be leaving the beach less pink for future visitors. 4th Stop: Manta PointThe best diving and snorkeling in Indonesia are in areas like Manta Point, that offer a truly magical experience.We opted to organize a private tour that included diving instead of snorkeling, but the standard tours will include snorkeling, which I highly recommend! While you might not see mantas every time, you will get to see a gorgeous array of coral and sea life. More InformationTour: Komodo National Park Day TripCompany: Ora DiveCost: 8 people for Rp 12,000,000.00 (about $1,200 USD)Useful Notes: Our private tour was organized through Ora Dive and it was a great experience, but rather expensive since we chose a private charter with diving.There are countless companies offering group tours for approx. Rp 650,000.00 or $50 USD per person that are a great option for sightseeing and/or exploring solo. Once arriving in Labuan Bajo, you can find countless countless shops lined up on Jl. Soekarno Hatta road, near the Le Pirate Resort, offering the same day tour for a fraction of the cost."

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-kelimutu-volcanic-lakes-in-indonesia/,Visiting Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes in Indonesia,Indonesia,"Ready for one of the most magical experiences in Indonesia? I experienced the Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes and have to recommend you do the same! While I’m all about spending another day lazing around beautiful Bali, it’s time to get to the island of Flores to take in the great outdoors.Here’s everything you need to know about visiting the Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes! Getting ThereThe Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes are located on the island of Flores near the small town of Moni. You’ve got a few different options for getting there. If you are starting in Bali, you can fly into Ende or Maumere.Maumere is the largest town in Flores and a great place for a stopover. If you spend the night in Maumere, it’ll take you about four hours to reach Moni. From Moni, the Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes are about forty-five minutes away.Flying into Ende is another good option. From the airport, it is forty minutes to Ende city and then three hours to the nearest village. From the village, people usually walk about two and a half hours to get to the lakes. The entire island of Flores is gorgeous, so it’s one of those situations where the journey is just as good as the destination.Whichever way you get to Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes, it’s worth it.Read More: The Ultimate Flores Island Travel GuideBest Time to GoIndonesia’s dry season runs from May to September, and you’ll generally find the best weather in July and August. If you can go during the summer, I’d recommend it, but do keep in mind that it’s the peak season, so you’ll want to make reservations for everything. I visited the Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes in September, and it was an amazing experience!Whenever you go, you’ll want to plan on getting up early to watch the sunrise.Hiking KelimutuOn the day you are hiking Kelimutu, be sure that you are staying nearby. You can stay in Moni, which is your closest pick, but it’s got a limited number of (bare bones) guesthouses. Maumere has the widest variety of options, but it’ll take you about four hours to get to Kelimutu. Ende has some good mid-range picks and will have you about three hours from the lakes.Keep in mind, we are talking about a seriously early adventure.You’ll want to arrive by 4:30 a.m. to get to the peak in time for sunrise. I know that’s a crazy early day, but it’s well worth it. It’ll take you less than thirty minutes to hike up to the top, and it’s an easy walk.As you are walking up, be sure to follow the signs.The path winds around a bit and you’ll want to make sure you make it ALL the way up to the top. Also, grab breakfast before you go! There are lots of people selling little snacks and drinks but it’s good to have a hearty meal to start your day.Interesting FactsThe Kelimutu Volcanic Lakes have a fascinating backstory. There are three different lakes together where locals believe their ancestors’ spirits live on.  They believe that the lakes change color as the spirits’ moods change.The westernmost lake is called the Lake of Old People (Tiwu Ata Mbupu). If you live a good life, your spirit will go to this lake after you die. This lake is usually blue.The other two lakes are right next to each other. The Lake of Young Men and Maidens (Tiwu Nuwa Muri Koo Fai) is most often an emerald color. The Enchanted Lake (Tiwu Ata Polo) is famously blood red and it’s where bad spirits go.While there’s no hard evidence of what actually causes the color changes, scientists believe that it has to do with the volcano gas activity that causes a chemical reaction with the lakes’ natural minerals—but that story isn’t nearly as fun!Do you have any tips for visiting Kelimutu? Let me know down below!"

If you’re looking for beaches and fresh seafood, head to Seminyak, Canggu or Uluwatu!But Indonesia is more than just Bali. I have explored more of Indonesia—everywhere from Komodo to Kelimutu to Raja Ampat.Lombok and the Gili Islands lie just off the coast of Bali and are accessible by daily speedboats. They’re more rustic and “off-the-grid” than neighboring Bali, and more untouched, in my opinion.Flores is a beautiful island in eastern Indonesia and one that I would highly recommend, especially if you’re trying to visit the Komodo Islands. During my days in Labuan Bajo, I stayed at Le Pirate Resort, ventured to Padar Island and Pink Beach, Melo Village, Cunca Waterfall, and spotted Komodo dragons!A major highlight for me was scuba diving in Komodo National Park!The next day I hopped over to Ende to explore and experience the Wologai cultural village and do a sunrise hike to the Kelimutu volcanic craters—it was an unbelievable experience.I’ve also adventured through Raja Ampat on a diving Liveaboard trip. I spent 12 magical days onboard and completed a whopping 28 dives throughout the 12-day cruise. It was a bucket list scuba diving trip!In between dives, we had the opportunity to explore the beautiful lagoons of Raja Ampat and the protected Misool Marine Reserve which protects 300,000 acres of the world’s richest reefs. We hopped on a speedboat to snorkel some smaller reefs and admire the gorgeous, white sand beaches.There are so many adventures to be in had in Indonesia; the opportunities are endless!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-hotel-tugu-bali-canggu/,Staying at Hotel Tugu Bali,Indonesia,"Traveling around this globalized world, sometimes I crave the days of old-fashioned adventure. I long for a time when crossing the globe meant leaving behind all that’s familiar and embarking on a journey of unimaginable shocks and surprises.I found some of the magic of vintage escapism at Hotel Tugu Bali!Transporting me back to the most romantic times of Bali, this hotel is dizzying-ly beautiful and a far cry from the cookie-cutter properties you’ll find everywhere else.The HotelPart of a small, privately owned and designed collection of luxury art hotels and restaurants, Hotel Tugu Bali was built with love. The owner’s mind-blowing collection of Indonesian art and antiques is housed exclusively in his gorgeous hotels.For me, there’s nothing more beautiful than Balinese architecture and design. Being able to get hands-on and stay among so many pieces of stunning art was such a treat for me. It brought to life the romance of days gone by in Bali.RoomsEvery room in Tugu Bali is unique, from the massive Puri Le Mayeur Villa set atop a pond to the Walter Spies Pavilion, which calls back to Java’s art deco era in the early twentieth century.Each decorated with unique artwork, the Dedari, and Rejang suites feature oversized beds, sunken baths, private pools, and in-room spas. My favorite part, each room is nestled in private gardens and offers spectacular views of rice paddy fields and panoramic sunsets!Whichever option you go for, you can look forward to a complimentary welcome massage and daily fresh tropical fruits and flowers.Dining ExperiencesThe hotel offers amazing restaurant and dining experiences. Every time you go to eat you can enjoy a new atmosphere and cuisine. And this is no cheesy theme restaurant.

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-go-bali/,The Best Time to Travel to Bali,Indonesia,"A lot of people have some strong opinions when it comes to the best time to go to Bali. Most people will tell you that you should always plan your trip to avoid the wet season. I’m not one of those people though! I think that Bali can be enjoyed 365 days a year. Whether you go in the wet season or the dry season, Bali is one of the most amazing, tropical destinations on Earth.Here’s the best time to go to Bali, based on season!Year-Round Weather in BaliLocated barely 500 miles south of the equator, Bali has a distinctly tropical climate. Regardless of the month, you visit or where you stay on the island, you are likely to find yourself sitting in weather between 80 and 85 degrees and humidity. While it can get a bit cooler, you will rarely need anything more than a light jacket.While we usually talk about seasons in terms on summer, winter, fall, and spring, the Balinese look at things differently. They only have two times of year: the wet season and the dry season. Both have their pros and cons when it comes to traveling in Bali. Bali in the Winter & SpringMonths: Late December – AprilThe wet season is, of course, wet! The regular rain is what puts people off from traveling to Bali during the late winter and spring, but it doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. It is warm year-round, so you can enjoy hours in the sun and long afternoons at the beaches.The wet season is honestly my favorite time to go to Bali!The rain often moves through with incredible speed. One quick downpour and the clouds can go away for the day. And the rain isn’t all that bad! If you have been in other parts of Asia that experience monsoons—think India and its intense soaks—it is comparatively mild.Tranquility is the number one reason to come to Bali during the rainy season. You can forget about noisy restaurants and overcrowded beaches. You will have plenty of room to stretch your legs and explore. The beaches are quieter. The streets are less congested. Peace is yours for the taking!One of the biggest events of the winter is Nyepi, the Balinese equivalent to New Year’s Eve. Though it’s a festive celebration, it is also a time of introspection. A day of silence is celebrated and filled with fasting and meditation. You will never see the island so calm. The dates of Nyepi vary each year. You can check out the 2017 celebration on March 28.The Bali Spirit Festival, held yearly in March and April, is another reason to visit Bali in the spring. Unlike anything you have ever seen before, the Bali Spirit Festival is a global celebration of world music and well-being.Winter Highlight: Nyepi CelebrationSpring Highlight: Bali Spirit Festival Bali in the Summer & FallMonths: May – Early DecemberThe dry season is the busiest and most popular time to go to Bali. In particular, May through September is the most popular time of year to visit. It is warm, and the humidity level is low all summer. While you will see some crowds, the weather will be nice and there’s plenty to do.The annual Bali Arts Festival is held in June and July, and it’s a must-see for any art lover. The parade is a true sight to behold, and art performances pack the calendar of the Denpasar Arts Center.Another one of the most popular festivals of summer is the Bali Kite Festival. The iconic yearly event celebrates the traditional art of Balinese kite making. And these are no ordinary nylon kites! Ranging from profound to silly, the kites are a representation of the people of Bali. The dates vary every year, and the calendar for 2017 will be out soon.Last but not least, is the most important festival of the year in Bali: Galungan! The entire island comes together every year for ten days to celebrate all the Balinese gods descending to earth. The 2016 celebration will run from September 7 to 17.Summer Highlight: Bali Arts FestivalFall Highlight: Galungan Festival"

Though often busy with tourists, Bali is still surprisingly affordable if you know where to look. Depending on your accommodation style, I would estimate $50 USD a day is a good estimation of a budget to travel very comfortably around Bali.Here are my tips for traveling Bali on a budget! Accommodation There are tons of great hostel options in Bali if you prefer the social scene! My go-to are private villas on Airbnb, and I’ve even found some for as low as 350,000 IDR ($25 USD) a night. Look for jungle vibes, pretty pools, and breathtaking cliff-side views; there’s no shortage of these on the island.Canggu/Seminyak AreaGrandmas Plus Hotel Seminyak: Just a 2-minute walk from Seminyak Beach, this budget hotel offers modern, single rooms starting at $23 USD per night.Black Pearl Hostel: Located in Canggu and within a short walk to Echo Beach, this hostel has a beautiful pool and offers a restaurant, free WiFi, an outdoor swimming pool, plus garden and pool view terraces. Beds start at $14 USD per night.Kos One Hostel: This is a very trendy and design-centric hostel — it has a beautiful pool and a stunning buffet breakfast.La Boheme Canggu: This property also has one of the top-rated locations in Canggu!

Renting a motorbike is the “way” of Bali and very cheap. You can hire one for 30,000-50,000 IDR ($3-$5 USD) a day! If you don’t feel comfortable driving yourself, you can use the GO-JEK app for an Uber-type service but on the back of a motorbike.Read More: 10 Tips for Your First Trip to BaliMealsEven if the hotels were insanely expensive in Bali, the cuisine alone would make it worth the visit.

Warungs are local restaurants with cheap prices featuring food from all over Indonesia.As a plus, food found at warungs is generally really fresh!But even restaurants owned by westerners can be quite inexpensive—look for brunch cafés and vegan delis all over the island.

https://theblondeabroad.com/top-romantic-getaways-in-bali-for-couples/,Top Romantic Getaways in Bali for Couples,Indonesia,"If you and your loved one are looking for a romantic vacation spot this year, you HAVE to plan a trip to Bali. Bali is the most popular island in the Indonesia archipelago- located about 100 miles south of the Equator.The weather in Bali is hot and humid all year long, so you and your partner can throw on the bathing suits and head to the beach whether you visit Bali in June or December. Of course, some months tend to have more rain, but in our experience, that is mostly during the afternoon.Bali itself is magical, romantic, and inspiring.

https://theblondeabroad.com/which-four-seasons-bali-resort-is-better/,Which Four Seasons Bali Resort is Better,Indonesia,"There are two Four Season Resorts in Bali—Jimbaran Bay and Sayan. I’ve been fortunate enough to stay with both, and experience the true luxury they offer, so here’s the scoop on picking the best resort for your vacation in Bali.I’ve broken down the categories that I always look for in resorts, and I believe both of these properties offer the ultimate Four Seasons and Bali experience.Here’s what I think about the Four Seasons Bali resorts!Overall ResortJimbaran BayThe luxurious Four Seasons at Jimbaran Bay is a beachgoer’s delight. Winner of countless awards including Travel + Leisure’s 500 Best Hotels in the World 2014, this world-class hotel features an infinity pool, a holistic spa, and three renowned restaurants with occasional themed dinners.Seafood BBQ anyone?I was lucky enough to stay in one of the new Premier Villas at Four Seasons Bali Jimbaran- these beautiful villas were fully renovated but maintained the authenticity of the Balinese architecture. I’m in love!You can dine out or enjoy the privacy of round-the-clock in-villa dining. Take to the waves with water sports: paddle boarding, surfing, Hobie Cat sailing, windsurfing, and kayaking.Recommended for: Families or friends looking to have fun!SayanThe Four Seasons at Sayan is a secret sanctuary far away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. This resort is perfect for couples who are looking to relax and restore their energies under peaceful canopies.Pamper yourself with world-class massage, yoga, and meditation at this intimate resort. The 18-acre retreat also houses two exceptional restaurants—Indonesian Ayung Terrace and the casual Riverside Café. You’ll also find the Jati Bar, which specializes in high tea and cocktails.Recommended for: Romantic couples who want a break away from it all!Location, Location, LocationJimbaran Bay:The Four Seasons Jimbaran is located in the north part of the Bukit Peninsula and is about a 15-minute drive from the airport. There’s no easier way to recover from jet lag than jumping into the pool within an hour of landing!Sayan:Unlike its Four Seasons sister the Jimbaran, the Sayan is nestled deep in the heart of Bali’s jungles. The property lies on the beautiful Ayung River just four miles from Ubud.RoomsJimbaran Bay:You can rent from a number of villas or residence villas that feature two to four bedrooms. All rooms feature authentic Indonesian furniture, dining table and sitting area, and an air conditioned bedroom—some even come with an infinity edge or plunge pool.Like I mentioned, the Premier Villas (my room pictured above) were stunning, and were completely renovated for the first time since 1993. A must stay!Spring for the ocean view if you simply can’t live without overlooking the water!Sayan:The hotel features 18 family and one-bedroom suites and 42 private villas to accommodate any traveler. Each room is furnished in rich teak and traditional Balinese décor and offers free Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs, and room service. You can even get a villa with its own kitchen.Be sure your room comes with a private plunge pool!ActivitiesJimbaran Bay:At the Four Seasons Jimbaran, you can enjoy a world-class spa experience like no other. Balinese traditional massage, energy healing facials, scrubs, massages, salon treatments, and body wraps will cleanse your spirit and transport you to tropical bliss.Book an afternoon at the deliciously fun Cooking Academy. This single-building school features a state-of-the-art kitchen where you can learn how to make traditional Indonesian cuisine from all over—Java, Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, and Sumatra.Classes are available daily for both beginners and more experienced chefs and offer an optional tour of the fish market. There’s even a kids’ Indonesian dessert class once a week.Off-campus, head to one of the many Bali beaches for year-round surfing, or party through the night just 30 minutes away in Seminyak.Sayan:On-site there is a pool, a hot tub, a spa, and a fitness center. You can also join the on-site cooking classes or easily rent a bike or car from the concierge for a variety of off-site activities. The Ubud area is home to many rice paddies where you can meander, enjoy tea, and learn about the daily life of a rice paddy farmer.Four Seasons Sayan also has a brand-new Dharma Shanti Yoga Bale that sits in their Sacred River Spa, and I was lucky enough to get to experience!Catch a ride to the ancient carvings at the Goa Gajah cave, which is less than six miles away. Hike out to the Mount Batur, an active volcano, or go on an exciting river rafting adventure. For a more leisurely day, drive into Ubud town and window-shop at the art galleries and charming boutiques.Thank you to the Four Seasons properties for hosting me during my stay. As always, all opinions expressed here are entirely my own."

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-resorts-in-bali-for-couples/,The Best Resorts in Bali for Couples,Indonesia,"For such a small island, Bali is one of the most incredible places we have ever had the pleasure of visiting. Everything from the beaches, to the food, to the people, and especially the resorts are nothing short of world class.If you think choosing the right region to spend your time in Bali is tough, we expect finding the right resort might be even more challenging.We have visited just about the entire island of Bali and have put together a list of 4 resorts which we believe are the best resorts in Bali for couples. So instead of scouring TripAdvisor and cross referencing your results against reviews, look no further!Here is our list of the best resorts in Bali for Couples!Four Seasons JimbaranSummarizing the experience of our stay with the Four Seasons at Jimbaran in less than 1000 words of praise and adoration is going to be quite a challenge. The property has been perfectly constructed to provide a panoramic view of Jimbaran Bay regardless of where you find yourself on the property.The magic of Bali and Jimbaran itself are both reflected through each and every aspect of the resort as well as the staff who are some of the most hospitable and kind people you’ll ever meet.We honestly had multiple conversations about how overjoyed we would be if we could move into our villa and never leave the property. Our villa sat just about 100 meters from the ocean, so our view was obviously to die for.Top that off with a private pool, outdoor shower, and every amenity one could wish for.If you need more swimming room than your villa’s private pool offers, you can make your way to one of two beautiful infinity pools the resort boasts.For a quiet, romantic, experience choose the “quiet pool” where you’ll find one of the most breathtaking views overlooking all of Jimbaran, and for a beach/restaurant experience where kids are welcome, head to the Sundara pool that also happens to be the longest pool in all of Bali.Even if you’re not a guest of the hotel, you’re welcome to rent a day bed here and enjoy some incredible cocktails. Sundara has their own signature drinks that are the perfect combination of top alcohol and the best fruits Bali has to offer.The beach in front of the hotel is perfectly suited for surfing if that is something you or your significant other is interested in! Tropicsurf is a wonderful option for couples as well because they offer stand up paddle, surfing, and more, during your stay.Regardless of where you choose to swim you’ll likely work up an appetite. Four Seasons Jimbaran offers a number of dining selections but our preference is the aforementioned, Sundara, which has the best Asian-inspired cuisine, and the most unique dining experience we had during our stay in Bali.If all of that wasn’t enough, we capped our stay with a 2.5 hour heart chakra balancing spa treatment from Heaven. This was an absolutely euphoric experience that is all too perfect for couples!Five stars does a disservice to the Four Seasons Jimbaran who place themselves well beyond most five star resorts!Four Seasons Sayan, UbudWalking into the Four Seasons (FS) Sayan is an experience in and of itself. A bridge separates the real world from a gorgeous lotus pond and a resort that is simply magical. The entire property was constructed so that each piece of the resort is enveloped by the jungle of Sayan (just outside of Ubud).The inspiration for the property comes from local traditional Ubud culture and history and is richly visible through the architecture, staff, food, and vibe of the resort.Read More: Where to Stay in BaliThe aforementioned lotus pond made for the most romantic dinner on our lives! The FS Sayan staff set up a private table surrounded by rose pedals, flowers, and glowing candles to create an absolutely unforgettable dining experience. This is an imperative for couples visiting FS at Sayan.For those of you wishing to embrace another rich aspect of Balinese culture, head to the open air yoga studio which is made of bamboo and situated in the middle of beautiful rice fields that approach the Ayung River that flows behind the property.If you travel up the river just a bit you’ll come to the pool which has to be one of the most beautiful and unique swimming pools we have ever seen. Rather than trying to describe it, just check it out for yourself!We didn’t get a chance to have a spa treatment in Sayan but we did tour the spa facility. Wow! Just wow. The spa is essentially an island in the middle of a lotus pond. The aura of the spa is so peaceful and serene. Definitely plan a couples’ massage when you visit!Similar to our Jimbaran villa, we had an outdoor shower, a private pool with a huge deck/backyard, and a couch, minibar, etc. You can literally walk around naked outside and no one at the resort can see you. It was truly so private and romantic and so in tune with nature.Again, 5 stars does a disservice to the team at FS. When you plan your trip to Bali, make sure to include both FS Jimbaran and FS Sayan on your itinerary.KamandaluKamandalu truly embraces the nature aspect of Ubud with sprawling rice paddy fields and a stream running through the property. Two pools are offered and fit different tastes.The larger of the two is at the middle of the property and even has a bar, lounge chairs in ankle deep water, and much more. The lower pool is a beautiful infinity pool that is secluded enough to feel as if you’re in the middle of the Ubud jungle.If you’re considering a wedding in Ubud, the Kamandalu ought to be one of your first choices. The presumed venue is a gorgeous amphitheater that has a similar view of the jungle to the aforementioned infinity pool. The essence of love can be felt simply from the venue itself.There seems to be a theme here… our favorite resorts in Bali all have incredible villas. Seriously though, our villa at Kamandalu was wonderful!The backyard had a daybed that faced the jungle of Ubud and the bed…. oh dear lord, the bed…. honestly we aren’t sure what to call the bed. It was far too large to be a king…maybe a XXL King? We laid on opposite sides of the bed and laughed as we could hardly reach each other. Seriously perfect for couples that like to sprawl out while they sleep.The bathroom has an in-floor bathtub, his and hers sinks, and the shower is outdoor which was especially nice on the night we stayed as we were able to see a beautiful sky full of stars.Kamandalu is an experience, and a wonderful one. The property, staff, and overall experience were one we hope to enjoy again in the near future. There is no doubt about it that Kamandalu earns 5 stars in our book.Intercontinental Resort Bali, JimbaranFor planning purposes you can likely see a trend that ought to be followed. Ubud and Jimbaran are musts on your trip to Bali. The Intercontinental Resort Bali sits just in the middle of Jimbaran Bay, about equidistant between the two sets of local seafood restaurants found on the beach.After having spent a month researching and visiting what we believed would be the best resorts for couples in Bali, we can confidently say that the Intercontinental is the best resort we found for couples with children.With multiple restaurants, a number of bars (including a swim-up bar at the main pool), and a no children high tea room, there are plenty of escapes for couples without children. However, for couples with children, the family aspect of the water park (for lack of a better term), playground, and a surf school that’s located nearby are absolutely perfect.Adults and children alike will love the number of hammocks that are scattered around the property, each hanging between two palm trees; defining relaxation and paradise.The most important thing to highlight in this piece was that during our stay with Intercontinental we stayed in the Club Intercontinental.Club Intercontinental has many amenities not accessible to other guests including larger suite style rooms, a private pool, a complimentary cocktail reception at one of a number of locations around the property, complimentary breakfast, and a 24 hour butler service.In conclusion…Realistically, you’re going to have an amazing trip regardless of where you spend your time in Bali. Balinese culture is easily the most humble, friendly, and hospitable culture we have encountered.However, if you would really like to take your trip to the next level, any of these four resorts will be sure to elevate your time in Bali to surpass any and all expectations you might have.If you need more details about any of the properties or have specific questions, feel free to connect with us in the comment section below.We will do our best to respond to each of you!Special thanks to Four Seasons Jimbaran, Four Seasons Sayan, Kamandalu, and Intercontinental Resort Bali for hosting us as their guests. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely our own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/6-reasons-to-plan-a-romantic-getaway-to-the-gili-islands/,6 Reasons to Plan a Romantic Getaway to the Gili Islands,Indonesia,"Imagine your picture perfect romantic getaway.  Did you think about a tropical beach on an island with beautiful white sand and crystal clear turquoise blue water? Yeah, us too!  If you’re looking for a tropical romantic getaway on an island you’ve honestly probably never heard of, then you definitely need to start planning your trip to the Gili Islands.The Gili Islands are an archipelago of 3 small islands just off the East coast of Bali, Indonesia. Conveniently, the Gili Islands each offer a different vibe and experience which means that this destination works for just about any couple out there.If you’re like us, and the honeymoon vacation is your idea of a romantic getaway, then both Gili Meno and Gili Air offer a romantic, relaxed, honeymoon vibe. Gili Meno is actually commonly referred to as the honeymoon island and Gili Air offers tons of beautiful beaches and is inhabited by a number of locals who will make you feel right at home.Perhaps the honeymoon style getaway isn’t particularly your style? That’s ok!Gili Trawangan is the most popular of the Gili Islands and is known as a party destination. It also has a number of awesome swings and hammocks hanging over the ocean that will be sure to relax you after a long day of fun.Regardless which island you choose- or perhaps you’ll choose 2- or all 3 of them– there are a load of reasons that the Gili Islands ought to be your next romantic getaway!Here is why we think you should plan a romantic getaway to the Gili Islands!– Natural Beauty –We think these pictures can pretty much speak for themselves.  The Gili Islands are one of the most beautiful places we have ever been.  White sand beaches meet crystal clear water that is about as warm as a bath.The center of the islands are covered densely by beautiful trees and other greenery that makes its way all the way up to the beach- providing a very private feel.– No Cars –There is literally zero chance that a car will keep you awake at night, and you will have zero concern about renting a car here because there are no cars on the islands.The “faster” form of transportation is a horse drawn carriage that will take you around the island for about $7.– Snorkeling –Gili Meno and Gili Air share a reef between them that offers some incredible snorkeling!  We chose to snorkel just off Gili Meno because we found out that it is essentially sea turtle Mecca.We were not at all disappointed as we ended up swimming with two beautiful sea turtles and a ton of gorgeous fish!– People –To catch you all up a bit, we are currently spending 2 months in Bali, Indonesia.  Over the last 2 weeks we have had the pleasure of meeting some of the most incredible people we have ever met.The people of Bali are beyond happy, humble, friendly, and hospitable.  The same goes for the Gili Islands and most parts of Indonesia.  The locals you’ll meet on the Gili Islands make you feel like family.We only stayed on each island for one night but just after 24 hours we had our hotel staff and some of our new local friends asking us not to leave!– Exclusive –Other than a few hundred locals and a few hundred tourists, the Gilis are very exclusive.  Ask your friends…odds are that most haven’t even heard of them.It’s not hard to find a private beach and really feel like you and your significant other have escaped to paradise!– Budget Friendly –Yes!  For a 4-star hotel you’re probably looking at spending about $80-90 a night.  On top of that, food, drinks, snorkeling, scuba diving, and other activities are all super cheap as well!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/solo-female-travelers-guide-bali/,The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Bali,Indonesia,"Although Bali, Indonesia can sometimes have a reputation for being inundated with wild partygoers who run wild, there are plenty of areas where solo female travelers can kick back and enjoy some rest and relaxation.Whether you love to relax by a picturesque beach, enjoy meeting locals and learning the culture, surfing, yoga, or simply wish to laze around at a five-star resort, the island of Bali has you covered.There are many areas in this popular holiday destination where you can avoid the crowds and simply enjoy vacationing in a diverse and laid-back part of the world.Here’s my guide to Bali as a solo female traveler!Where to Stay in BaliBali is home to the most beautiful villas and resorts, available to the budget traveler and the luxury seeker—so there are a lot of accommodation options!Canggu/Seminyak AreaGrandmas Plus Hotel Seminyak: Just a 2-minute walk from Seminyak Beach, this budget hotel offers modern, single rooms starting at $23 USD per night.Black Pearl Hostel: Located in Canggu and within a short walk to Echo Beach, this hostel has a beautiful pool and offers a restaurant, free WiFi, an outdoor swimming pool, plus garden and pool view terraces. Beds start at $14 USD per night.Kos One Hostel: This is a very trendy and design-centric hostel — it has a beautiful pool and a stunning buffet breakfast.La Boheme Canggu: This property also has one of the top-rated locations in Canggu! Beds start at $11 USD per night.Ubud AreaRun House B&B: A simple B&B with air-conditioned rooms and free WiFi, and close to the Ubud Palace and Monkey Forest. Double rooms start at $13 USD per night!WW Backpackers: A high-rated hostel in Ubud, very central to all the sites.Suka’s House B&B: Suka’s House Bed & Breakfast features an outdoor pool and private rooms starting at $25 USD. Daily breakfast is served in the private terrace overlooking the garden.If you have a bigger budget for this trip, my advice is to take advantage of the low price point of Bali and rent a private villa for yourself. Many resorts and villa rental companies offer villas with private pools, exquisite ocean or jungle views, spacious decks, minibars, and comfy couches.These villas give you complete privacy—you can walk around naked without a care in the world… you’ll feel tucked away into nature.Find more of my recommendations in the Ultimate Bali Travel Guide!Top Things to Do in BaliChill Out at a Beach ClubA great way to relax in Bali is by spending time at one of the many luxurious beach clubs spread around the region. Popular clubs like Mrs. Sippy’s and Potato Head Beach Club are located in Seminyak and give you fun swim-up bars, infinity pools, a variety of day beds, and lots of DJs and entertainment.Another top Seminyak beach club is La Plancha, the first in the area to introduce beanbags on the beach. La Plancha has quirky decor, a funky “Spanish meets surfer” style, and fantastic Mediterranean-inspired cuisine for those wanting something to nibble on.On my most recent trip, I visited La Laguna in Canggu, and was blown away by the beautiful beach, amazing sunset, and lively nightlife.Nurture the Mind and BodyThere are many ways to take care of your physical, spiritual, and mental health while in Bali. If you’d like to learn how to cook Balinese fare there are a variety of tours you can participate in where you’ll learn about the local way of cooking and dining.Visit Pura Taman Saraswati TempleBuilt to honor Dewi Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and the arts, this beautiful temple is alive with lotus blossoms and water flows.Monkey Forest in UbudSmack-dab in the jungle, Ubud has its fair share of monkeys. But be careful! They are super aggressive. Don’t make contact or interact with the monkeys unless you have bananas. I found the most friendly monkeys at the entrance to the forest where they probably get the most food. For the best photos, walk a bit farther into the forest—you’ll get to a stunningly beautiful temple area.Read More: Top Things to See and Do in Ubud, BaliYoga at Four Seasons SayanPractice YogaAlso highly recommended in Ubud is The Yoga Barn, a place to stretch the body, clear the mind, and take in stunning scenery. The facility provides a large number of yoga classes (many of which are free) in styles such as Iyengar, Hatha, Vinyasa Flow, Pranayama, Power, and Yin.Lounge Poolside (& Beachside!)There’s no shortage of beautiful coastline and villa pools to be lounged around in Bali. It’s the perfect place to relax, chill, and soak up some of that wonderful Indonesia sunshine!Read More: The Ultimate Canggu Travel GuideGetting Around BaliMy recommendation is to avoid the traffic of Bali by renting a scooter—a fast way to zip through the streets and countryside. Renting a motorbike is the “way” of Bali and very cheap. If you don’t feel comfortable driving yourself, you can use the GO-JEK app for an Uber-type service but on the back of a motorbike.Taxis are the most expensive, and Uber is somewhat banned by the a monopoly on taxi service. You can still use Uber, but you need to be very discreet about it and can’t use them to get to and from populated areas. Otherwise, use the Blue Bird app for cab rentals.Read More about Getting Around Bali in the Ultimate Bali Travel Guide!Where to Eat & Drink in BaliIf you’re interested in flying to Bali to sample the fantastic food, you’ll be pleased to know that it is home to an astounding number of amazing restaurants and cafes.Café OrganicCafé Organic is very popular with the breakfast crowd and offers amazing food, great coffee, friendly staff, and beautiful decor. I would say it’s my favorite breakfast spot in Bali!SundaraFood lovers can head to one of the region’s more recent hotspots, Sundara.Named after the Sanskrit word for “beautiful,” Sundara is situated in the luxurious Four Seasons at Jimbaran Bay, which is very handy if you’re planning to stay at this five-star resort. Patrons can listen to the sound of the ocean lapping on the nearby beach as they dine, as well as take in the spectacular view of Jimbaran Bay. The restaurant has a beach-club vibe and serves up a variety of international dishes, with a special focus on fresh seafood.Ayana ResortFor incredible seafood and a sunset that you’ll never forget, make reservations at Kisik at the Ayana Resort for a sunset dinner. Arrive early for a pre-dinner drink at the cliff-faced Rock Bar. There are often live music artists and DJs that perform here making a fun atmosphere for meeting fellow travelers.Ginger MoonFor quality meals, make sure you visit the popular Seminyak venue, Ginger Moon. This modern restaurant is spread over two levels and produces dishes that are perfect for sharing between patrons.PetitengetThose looking to dine on French-inspired cuisine can visit another Seminyak establishment, Petitenget. With a French bistro vibe, the restaurant is popular with locals and tourists alike for long lunches, and stylish dinners.Cafe BaliOne of my favorite spots in Seminyak for a lazy brunch on a budget is Cafe Bali. Shabby chic decor and delicious breakfast make the perfect setting for a fresh start to the day.Read More: Where to Find the Best Vegan Food in Bali "
https://theblondeabroad.com/monkey-forest-ubud-markets-an-organic-farm/,"Top Things to See and Do in Ubud, Bali",Indonesia,"Updated 3/1/2016Whether you are looking for a traditional Balinese experience or a relaxing getaway, Ubud is a dream destination for most people traveling in Bali.Here’s a list of the top things to see and do in Ubud!Where to Stay in UbudVillas are a very common accommodation in Bali, and if you’re planning on staying in Ubud I’d recommend finding a place near Monkey Forest Road. It’s very central and you will be able to walk everywhere you want to go!Most private villas have beautiful pools, gardens, and offer a little slice of paradise!Here are some of my favorite places:The Kayon Resort: The perfect place to check-in to if you’re looking for a luxurious Bali experience! Set amidst a garden featuring a pool and chapel, the Kayon Resort in Ubud features luxurious air-conditioned rooms that boast a beautiful terrace, marble bathrooms, and views over the historical Petanu River and jungle.Sapodilla Ubud: Sapodilla Ubud is conveniently located within a 10-minute walk of Agung Rai Museum of Art and Wayang Kulit. This hotel features a restaurant, an outdoor pool and concierge services!Hostels: If you’re traveling on a budget, there are lots of budget and hostel options in Ubud.Get a Little Bit of LuxuryIf you’re looking for something more luxurious, or a resort property, I recommend the Four Seasons at Sayan. Just minutes from Ubud, this ‘Garden of Eden’ property sits right on the Ayung River.The resort is truly a secret sanctuary far away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It is perfect for couples who are looking to relax and restore their energies under peaceful canopies. Pamper yourself with world-class massage, yoga, and meditation at this intimate resort! Walk Through the Monkey ForestStart your day off at the Ubud Monkey Forest. There’s a small admission fee to walk through the forest and as soon as you get to the entrance you are greeted by TONS of monkeys. There are monkeys everywhere of all different sizes.After my incident of getting attacked while climbing the Tiger Cave Temple in Krabi, Thailand, I was a bit hesitant to get friendly with the furry little guys this time.Some of the bigger monkeys were wrestling and fighting right as we walked in and we crept cautiously by. You can feed them little bananas and they will jump all over you (even your head). But, be careful. There’s still a risk that you could get bitten or scratched.Helpful  Tip: Don’t “trick” a monkey into thinking you have a banana, in order to get a picture with one. If they realize you don’t have food, they will likely bite you! If you do get bitten, there are MANY clinics around that offer the rabies shot, so hurry on to one of those. Practice YogaAlso highly recommended in Ubud is The Yoga Barn, a place to stretch the body, clear the mind, and take in stunning scenery. The facility provides a large number of yoga classes (many of which are free) in styles such as Iyengar, Hatha, Vinyasa Flow, Pranayama, Power, and Yin.Explore the Rice Fields in UbudTake an afternoon to lose yourself around Ubud and wander through the small pathways around town. You never know what you’ll discover!At Four Seasons Sayan, you can actually experience Bali’s beauty and tradition firsthand by spending a day in the life of a local farmer. You start your journey wandering through rice fields and jungle paths along the banks of the Ayung River.Then, enjoy a picnic breakfast in a rice field pavilion, help local farmers plant rice, and end the day with a traditional bathing ritual and a soothing Balinese massage. Such an awesome experience! Cozy Up at a CafeThe breakfast game in Bali is real strong. So try a few different cafes while you’re in Ubud.Relax with fresh juice or a light meal at the shabby chic Art Kafe. The location is conveniently located near the Ubud Market and Monkey Forest, so stop in to recharge the batteries while you’re out exploring.Read More: The Best Coworking Spaces in BaliVisit Pura Tama SaraswatiThis beautiful temple located in the center of Ubud and honors Saraswati, the Goddess of knowledge, literature, and art. Pura Taman Saraswati is surrounded by a tranquil water garden filled with countless lotus flowers (and most recently, a Starbucks…).Shop at the Ubud MarketsBrowse the trinkets and Balinese products at the the Ubud markets. The items at the Ubud Market are more expensive than other destinations in Southeast Asia, but still cheap.There’s always room to haggle! I’ve found that many vendors love to start at 150,000 IDR on most clothing items, which means you can probably get down to 50,000 IDR.Farm to ForkThere are countless restaurants in Ubud that are sure to impress. But, two of my favorite spots are Sari Organik and The Elephant. Sari Organik is a little difficult to find, but most locals know what you’re talking about if you ask for Sari Organik.You’ll find a small wooden sign and then walk past rice fields and beautiful bungalows until you reach Sari Organik.Sari Organik sources all of their food locally at an organic farm across the road. You can even go to the farm and select whatever fruits, veggies, and spices you want and they will prepare them at the restaurant.Attend the Bali Spiritual FestivalA popular festival in Ubud is the annual Bali Spirit Festival, held in late March or early April. The event has been running for a number of years now and brings together musicians, dancers, and yogis from across the globe to celebrate the merging of Eastern and Western cultures.Visitors from over 50 countries come to the festival to take in such events as concerts, workshops, demonstrations, art installations, talks, and more. "

Because it’s almost impossible to be guaranteed a span of good weather, you’ll want to think about activities, crowds, and your budget.This is my guide to the best times to travel to Ireland!March to MayAlthough March is the beginning of spring, the weather in Ireland is still a bit chilly which deters tourists from visiting—until St. Patrick’s Day that is!Celebrating St. Patrick’s Day in Dublin is a bucket list experience that I highly recommend that everyone encounters at least once in their life. Expect crowded parties in every city, complete with live music, dancing, and drinking. And don’t forget to pack your green clothes!Come April and May, temperatures begin to warm up, with the average high in the mid to high 50s. Spring flowers reach their peak so this is a wonderful time to see the flowers lining the roads along the coast. These are some of the best months to experience Ireland’s rolling green hills and national parks.   June to AugustCome June, schools are out, the weather has warmed up, and crowds begin to arrive in the major cities, especially Dublin.The locals celebrate Bloomsday, a cultural festival celebrating Ulysses, a novel by James Joyce. You’ll find performances and readings throughout the city. Hotel prices do begin to rise but if you book far enough in advance, you should be able to lock down a deal.July and August are the busiest months of the year for Ireland.Temperatures are at their highest and in theory, these months are supposed to be the driest (but let’s face it, there’s always a chance of rain for the Emerald Isle). I went on a two-week road trip through Ireland during the summer and we were greeted with lovely weather—but we might’ve just gotten lucky. 😉In July, experience the Galway International Arts Festival where you can enjoy live music, theater, and art. In August, the Dingle Regatta (a water festival of boat races) is held.  September to NovemberThe fall is another beautiful time to visit Ireland, so long as you don’t mind bundling up a bit.The summer crowds have left and the days are still long, with the sun not setting until the late evening. If you’re a foodie, this is one of the best times to visit as there are a number of food festivals including the Galway International Oyster and Seafood Festival.The golden hues of the trees reach their peak in October and the mountains become covered in red shades. However, October and November are some of the wettest months so bring an umbrella with you if you feel like exploring.Some attractions and hotels close down in October and November as winter approaches but don’t let this deter you. There are still many festivals including Cork’s International Jazz Festival and the Dingle Food Festival. You will never find yourself bored in the fall!  Mizen Head, IrelandDecember to FebruaryThe holiday season in Ireland is truly magical. Christmas festivities begin at the beginning of December, with decorative lights, plays, and Christmas markets. If you don’t mind the cold, this is one of the best times to visit Dublin as the holiday cheer is in full swing.Outside of the city, the picturesque landscapes are covered in frost, making for picture-perfect opportunities. It’s fairly windy on the coast but many hotels stay open and welcome guests with hearty food and roaring fires.January and February remain empty and chilly so expect to spend plenty of time in a pub while the dreary and rainy weather continues on. Just don’t forget to stop by the Tradfest Music Festival held in the Temple District of Dublin. Although Ireland’s weather may not always be ideal, with a few layers and an umbrella, you can enjoy everything that the Emerald Isle has to offer year-round.Have you been to Ireland before? If so, where did you go and what time of year did you visit? I’d love to hear in the comments below! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/southern-ireland-road-trip-itinerary-via-the-wild-atlantic-way/,Southern Ireland Road Trip Itinerary Via the Wild Atlantic Way,Ireland,"One of the most beautiful places in Europe (just look at these pics from my last trip!), Ireland is an essential destination. Renowned for its unforgettable hospitality and jaw-dropping landscape, the Emerald Island has it all.During my two-week road trip around Ireland, I discovered why everyone has been raving about the Wild Atlantic Way—but it was the Southern Peninsulas that absolutely took my breath away! If you only have time to see one small part of Ireland, let it be this.Ready for the road trip of a lifetime? Here is my guide to road tripping the Southern Peninsulas of Ireland via the Wild Atlantic Way.  Tips for Driving the Wild Atlantic WayIrish roads are a bit scary. They are ultra-narrow and endlessly winding. There are times you will have to stop and pull off to the side of the road to let someone else go through.While you will want to come prepared, driving in Ireland is completely doable and SO worth it. I would recommend planning your days so that you have ample time to get from place to place. It is also best to drive during the day. Navigating during daylight is a lot less challenging.If you’re renting a car, try to book it as early as possible as *most* people prefer to drive an Automatic and those sometimes have limited availability. My go-to resource is Rentalcars.com as they provide competitive pricing for multiple rental car providers!Helpful Tip:Keep your eye out for small local restaurants as you drive. Some of the best food is served far from the capital! Here are a few of my fave Irish dishes to try while you are there.Highlights to Include in Your Itinerary for Southern IrelandThe Burren + Cliffs of MoherVisit or stay at Dromoland CastleHave a pint at Durty Nelly’sVisit Adare and Adare ManorDrive the Dingle PeninsulaVisit Killarney National ParkDrive the Ring of KerryVisit Skellig MichaelHike Lady Bantry’s Lookout in GlengarriffTake the ferry to Garnish IslandHave lunch at Manning’s EmporiumVisit Bantry HouseDinner at Blair’s CoveMizen Head to soak in the viewsRound of golf at Old HeadVisit the cute harbor town of KinsaleKiss the Blarney Stone at Blarney CastleVisit the Jameson Distillery in MidletonHere’s a breakdown of all of my favorite stops along the way! Exploring GalwayGalway is a perfect starting point for your adventure. I suggest flying into Dublin and you can get to Galway in about two and a half hours. You could also fly into Ireland West International Airport at Knock or Shannon International Airport.Wander the cobblestoned streets and listen to traditional music while trying out some of the incredible local craft beers. Claddagh is a local village where the famous Claddagh ring comes from and it’s an ideal spot to find a souvenir.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Ireland   Cliffs of MoherThe Cliffs of Moher and The BurrenAfter you’ve seen the essentials of Galway, it’s time to move on to the Cliffs of Moher. This is one of the most beloved sites in Ireland, and the drive over there is gorgeous.Start your trip out of Galway early and plan time to stop at The Burren. The unique karst landscape in this region of County Clare is prime for photo ops. It looks like the surface of the moon! Plan a stop to spend some time hiking through the Burren National Park.After getting a taste of the Irish countryside, you are ready for the crown jewel.You have probably seen pics of the Cliffs of Moher but none of them do it justice. The dramatic cliffs over the ocean are truly awesome in person.  Durty Nelly's Dromoland Castle A Castle and a BeerFor the perfect end to the day, get over to Dromoland Castle. It’s about an hour drive from the Cliffs of Moher. I’d recommend booking a room for the night or at least stopping by to explore.Not far from Dromoland Castle, you’ll find Durty Nelly’s. This 17th century thatched roof pub is the quintessential public house and it’s the best place for a pint after a long day of exploring. I mean, who can resist having a beer at one of Ireland’s first landmark pubs? Cheers!Helpful Tip:Keep your itinerary loose! Rural Ireland is all about living slowly and enjoying the moment. Give yourself ample time for the sometimes crazy roads and often unmissable pit stops.   Adare VillageThe adorable village of Adare is just over 30 minutes from Dromoland Castle and it’s a must. Adare Manor is the gem of a town, and you’ll want plenty of time to explore it.While it’s not really worth staying there, I would recommend going for one of their activities and sticking around for a meal. Play a round of golf or go for the falconry. Decide on your schedule then book lunch at one of the Adare Manor restaurants.   Dingle PeninsulaGet back in the car in the late morning or early afternoon so you’ve plenty of hours of daylight to get started on the drive around the Dingle Peninsula. Called “the most beautiful place on Earth” by National Geographic Traveller, the area is known for its beaches, craggy cliffs, and spirits.The Dingle Peninsula loop trip is only about 30 miles long but you can easily spend a couple of days exploring it. Drive the Dingle Peninsula in a clockwise direction so it’s easier to navigate the narrow roads that are regularly dotted with tourist buses. Start in Castlemaine then slowly make your way down.Inch Beach is one of the first stops. Explore the sandy beach then stay for a surf lesson. The Conor Pass is one of the highest passes in Ireland and it’ll give you a stunning view. It is windy and narrow though, so take it slow!The little town of Dingle is a colorful little place that you’re going to love.Linger over a meal and a pint, then try the famous Murphy’s ice cream. Made right in Dingle, this creamy treat is famous all over the island (yum!). I’d recommend staying in Dingle then starting your day early on the iconic path in Dingle Peninsula is the Slea Head Drive.   Killarney National ParkVisit Killarney National ParkAfter you’ve slowly made your way back across the Dingle Peninsula, head over to Killarney National Park. It was the first national park in Ireland, and it’s a great place for a long hike if you get a sunny day.   Drive the Ring of KerryThe Ring of Kerry is just over 100 miles long. You can drive it in under four hours but you will want to add plenty of times for stops. I’d recommend starting in Killarney and renting a bike. The Ring of Kerry is one of the best cycling spots in the world. Take your time cycling the Ring of Kerry and just appreciating the scenery.The Kerry Cliffs offer sweeping views of the Skellig Islands and Puffin Island. From there, you can take a boat out to the UNESCO World Heritage site of Skellig Michael.The trips are highly weather-dependent (this area gets lashed by the sea!) and generally just available during summer. You can schedule out your full options for travel on the Wild Atlantic Way site.   Hiking in Glengarriff Nature ReserveGo Hiking in GlengariffJust south of the Ring of Kerry, you’ll find Lady Bantry’s Lookout—one of the most scenic hikes, ever! Part of Glengarriff Nature Reserve, this is one of Ireland’s best hiking paths. It’s an easy hike and I’d recommend starting your day early here.There are a ton of other hiking trails here, too! Garnish IslandOnce you’ve gotten in your morning workout, take the ferry to Garnish Island. The ferry leaves from Glengarriff Pier every 30 minutes and doesn’t need to be pre-booked, so you can take your time enjoying the charm of the surrounding area.The gardens here are spectacular!Once you get over to the island, have lunch at the Manning’s Emporium, a cute little deli with tasty Irish staples, then go for a wander. Bantry HouseOriginally built in the early 18th century, the house and gardens have been open to the public since the 1940s and have since become a popular destination to visit while driving the Wild Atlantic Way.Why? Oh, just for the views for days and the stunning gardens, of course! Pop in here for a cup of tea and admire all the gorgeous greenery.Dinner at Blair’s CoveYou’ll need to book this well in advance, but believe me—it’s worth it! They have world-class grub at Blair’s Cove and I would 100% not miss this place for dinner!   Mizen HeadMizen HeadIn County Cork, the Arched Bridge at Mizen Head is famous as Ireland’s most Southwestern Point. Start at the Mizen Head Visitor Centre then start a beautiful hike.To be perfectly honest, I actually preferred this area to the ultra-popular Cliffs of Moher. The view was better in my opinion and it was less crowded, so it made for an all-around better experience. Get a Game in at Old HeadBook in a round of golf at Old Head for the afternoon. Not a golf fan? No worries—the views from this clifftop are seriously out of this world and make it for one memorable day.   KinsaleAfter a long day putting on the green, head over to the cute harbor town of Kinsale. You could definitely stay here for the evening—embrace alllllll of its charm, or just pop by for a quick visit.   Kiss the Blarney StoneYou can’t visit Ireland without kissing the Blarney Stone! Legend has it that giving the rock a smooch will give you the Irish gift of gab. The gardens at Blarney Castle are stunning as well so plan plenty of time to explore.Love a glass of whiskey? You can opt to stop at the Jameson Distillery in Midleton. Home of Ireland’s most famous whiskey, you can learn about the past and present of this iconic drink (and try a few top-notch cocktails!).Once you’ve finished the Southern Peninsula of Ireland, it’s easiest to fly out of Cork.If you have extra time, you might consider flying out of Dublin too. The city is another three hours of driving from Cork and typically has the most frequent and inexpensive flights. OverallWant to experience more of Ireland’s sensational scenery? The Wild Atlantic Way continues north and encompasses the Northern Headlands, the Surf Coast, and the Bay Coast.The vast majority of flights arrive into Dublin and it’s the perfect starting point.

A city rich in history, culture, and storytelling, Dublin has something for everyone.I’ll never forget my first time in Dublin.

If you are looking for friendly people, historical sites, and a cold pint or two, look no further than Ireland.Every Irish adventure starts in Dublin, and here are ten musts for when you visit Dublin!Temple BarBeyond iconic, Temple Bar is so famous that they actually named the entire neighborhood after it!

I told you guys about the top ten local foods to try in Ireland and I’d highly recommend chowing your way around the island. While much of Irish food is about the homemade hearty dishes that you’ll find in the countryside, Dublin is dishing up a few treats.For a classic greasy meal, get to Leo Burdocks Fish n’ Chips. Made famous for supplying the troops during the 1916 battle for independence, Leo Burdocks has been attracting celebs and politicians from all over the world ever since (check out their wall of fame!).With its claim to fame as “Dublin’s oldest chipper,” I’d recommend checking out the Leo Burdock in Christchurch.The tiny little takeaway spot can only hold a handful of people so grab your grub and take the short walk down to the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral where you can have a quick picnic before exploring the church.Pro tip: Ask for  ‘crispy bits’ in your chips for a mouthwatering dream come true. 10 Local Foods to Try in IrelandIrish food probably isn’t what you expect (corned beef and cabbage is actually an Irish-American dish)!

Read More   Spend an Afternoon in the Trinity College LibraryTrinity College is in the heart of Dublin and it’s one of the cultural centers of Ireland. If you are lucky enough to have a bit of sunshine during your visit, bring a good book and just lie in the lush gardens of the campus.And don’t forget the camera! An architectural masterpiece, Trinity College has regular events, a Zoological Museum, theatre, science gallery, and the famous Book of Kells. This book contains four Gospels of the New Testament that are more than a millennium old.While people often just snap pics of the Book of Kells and run out, I’d recommend checking out everything that Trinity College has to offer.  Christ Church CathedralChrist Church CathedralDublin’s oldest building, Christ Church Cathedral was founded in 1030 and it is home to the largest crypt in the UK and Ireland. The guided tour is perfect for learning the dynamic past and there are regular events where you can experience first hand a brief moment in the Cathedral’s history.If you are lucky enough to be in Dublin on a Sunday, you will hear the bells from Christ Church Cathedral echoing as you wander along the riverside.Best of all, you can actually go into the church and ring the bells yourself! You can sign up for the Friday practice session and then the real deal happens on Sunday.  Visiting the Guinness Storehouse Drink Up!Visit  the Guinness StorehouseYou can’t visit Dublin without having a Guinness! Even if you can’t stand the black stuff, give it another try in Dublin. The freshly brewed Irish variety tastes different from what you’ll have anywhere else in the world.I visited the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin and learned to pour the perfect pint. I’d highly recommend opting for the Connoisseur Tour!Explore the Dublin CastleIf the walls of the 800+-year-old Dublin Castle could talk! Spanning over 11 acres in the middle of Dublin city center, the castle is home to the Chapel Royal, the Chester Beatty Library, the Garda Museum, and the Revenue Museum.Plan ample time for the Chester Beatty Library, which is home to world-class European and Chinese cultural artifacts, and easily one of the best small museums in Europe.  Ha’penny BridgeWalk Across the Ha’penny BridgeThe first pedestrian path to bring people across the famous River Liffey, Ha’penny Bridge is one of the most famous sites of Dublin.It first opened back in 1816 when Ireland was charging half a penny (ha’penny!) to cross. Follow the journey that millions of travelers have taken over the centuries and get a prime view of the river that runs through the heart of the city.Check Out  the Buskers on Grafton StreetIreland’s premier shopping street and a path down to the gorgeous St Stephen’s Green Park, Grafton Street is a must.

Home to the president of Ireland and a diverse array of local wildlife, I’d recommend renting a bike to see all of the lush gardens and paths.You can grab lunch from the cafe in the park or pack your own, then just sit and take in the view.   “Trad Sessions” at  the Hairy LemonTraditional Irish music, often just called trad, is a very big deal in Ireland. Local musicians have the crowds up dancing seven days a week at these quaint sessions. At many spots, anybody can actually just walk in and start playing with the band, which means that no two sessions are ever alike.The Hairy Lemon Pub is the best place to take it all in.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-two-week-ireland-road-trip-itinerary/,The Ultimate Two-Week Ireland Road Trip Itinerary,Ireland,"I visited Dublin ages ago and had been dying to go back ever since. While Dublin is a great time, I knew I had barely scratched the surface. The Emerald Isle has so much to offer and it truly takes a full round-trip to take in the beauty…and what better way to do that than by taking a road trip through Ireland?The best way to see Ireland is to rent a car and circle the island. I did a similar road trip in Iceland and it’s held a special place in my heart ever since. Visiting the villages and sites far from the tourist path connects you with a country in a way you can’t experience during a quick city break.Looking to find the gold at the end of the rainbow? I’ve planned the ultimate excursion for a two-week road trip around Ireland!Do keep in mind that you are covering an entire country in two weeks so it can be a bit fast-paced. If there are days where you feel like just hanging out in the pub or soaking in that rare bit of sun in the emerald countryside, go for it!The best itinerary is a flexible itinerary.If there’s anything you’re dying to see or do, book early to make sure you have a reservation. For the rest, go with the flow.Here is everything you need to know to plan your ultimate two-week Ireland road trip itinerary.Get PreppedBefore you set off on your road trip through Ireland though, come prepared.Driving in Ireland isn’t for the faint of heart! Unless you are coming from the UK, Australia, South Africa, or elsewhere that drives manuals on the left side, this will be a new experience. On top of that, the roads are SO narrow. When you rent a car, opt for the very smallest vehicle option you can find.At most rental places you can find an automatic car, but just in case—be prepared and book ahead of time!Some roads in Ireland are so tiny that you will find yourself driving off the road. This is especially true on the southside (anywhere south of Dublin/Galway). I learned that American Express won’t even offer their normal rental car coverage because of the crazy conditions. That definitely says something!While that may sound a bit scary, go for it! It is something you will want to be prepared for, but it’s totally manageable and worth it.   Temple Bar, DublinDay 1Arrive in DublinThe majority of flights go into Dublin and it’s a good starting point. I’d recommend booking your round-trip tickets to and from here because it’ll allow you to do a full circle. And there is so much to see in Dublin! You will definitely want to visit twice.Dublin is a completely walkable city and it is easy to cover a lot of ground in a short time.Trinity College will start you in the heart of the city. You can walk the campus there and see the renowned Book of Kells. After Trinity, stroll down the iconic Grafton Street until you reach St Stephen’s Green—Europe’s largest park.If the sun is on your side, continue down to another Georgian era park: Marrion Square. This is a dream destination for a stroll and it’ll bring you onto the National Museum of Ireland and the National Gallery.While Dublin is known as an expensive city, all of this is free! The only thing you’d have to pay for? If you want to get up close and personal to the Book of Kells!  Visiting the Guinness Storehouse Drink Up!Day 2Explore DublinYou’ll want a second day in Dublin and I’d recommend staying in the city center so you don’t lose any time to commuting.Start your day with an Irish breakfast then go snap some pics of the twelfth century Christchurch Cathedral.Walk over to Dublin Castle, which is admittedly a bit of a tourist trap but has a beautiful exterior. Right behind Dublin Castle, you will find the Chester Beatty Library, which has free admission and a fascinating collection of European and Chinese cultural artifacts.It’s widely considered to be one of the best small museums in Europe and has impressive claims to fame like displaying the largest collection of Chinese jade books and the top illuminated Qu’ran collection on the planet. Nearby, you will find Ireland’s largest church, St Patrick’s Cathedral, and its gorgeous garden.The Guinness Storehouse is open until 7 pm and it is the best way to getting your evening going. You can learn to pour the perfect pint and get a panoramic view of Dublin. Opt for the Connoisseur Tour for the best experience.Go thirsty!Another good place to get a view of the city is from the Poolbeg Lighthouse. It is on the outskirts of the city, so plan ahead to get there around sunset for an unforgettable panoramic.In the evening, do a self-guided pub crawl around town. Start from the top of George Street then make your way south to see where the locals go for a night out on the town.Bonus:If you find extra time or want to stick around for another day, there is so much more to see. Kilmainham Gaol is an essential historical site and Marsh’s Library is another good place for any history buff. If you would prefer to opt out of the pub crawl or stay another night, I’d suggest booking tickets for the Abbey Theatre.Day 3Dublin to Kilkenny with stops at Castletown House and GlendaloughStart your day taking the 30 minutes or so drive out to the beautiful Georgian estate of Castletown House. Get a glimpse into Ireland’s rich past then continue onto Powerscourt Estate (about a 45-minute drive). This beautiful estate is another prime photo op and it is the site of Ireland’s largest waterfall.End your day of exploring the countryside at the Glendalough Monastic site. Just another 30 minutes from Powerscourt, you will find these fascinating ruins. Plan ample time for them! This is a great place to hike and it’s open 24/7.After you have explored the outskirts of Dublin, move onto the quaint town of Kilkenny. You’ll find a range of beautiful accommodation picks and it is the site of Ireland’s most visited castle. Dedicate a good hour for a self-guided tour there.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Ireland  KilkennyDay 4Kilkenny to Waterford with stops at Kells Prior, Rock of Cahsel, and Hook LighthouseSpend the morning wandering the enchanting streets of Kilkenny. This medieval town is renowned for its local handicrafts and it’s full of hidden gems.About 20 minutes outside of town, Kells Prior will get you off the tourist path and into a twelfth-century Augustinian monastery. It’s free and open from dusk until dawn. On a clear day, you will want to take a long walk through the ruins.Just ten minutes from the Kells Prior is the Rock of Cashel. One of the most fascinating medieval religious sites and most visited places in Ireland, this religious site will transport you to another time.From the Rock of Cashel it is about two hours of driving time to the Hook Lighthouse. The world’s oldest working lighthouse will give you a stunning view of the east coast of Ireland. It’s just open until 6 pm though so plan accordingly. There is a 30-minute guided tour that provides access up the 115 steps for beautiful views.From the Hook Lighthouse, you are nearby Waterford, which is famous for its rich and well-preserved Viking history as well as the locally hand-crafted crystal. After a long day of exploring, you can sneak in an evening here!  Day 5Waterford to Killarney with stops at Cork, Blarney Castle, and Sheep’s Head PeninsulaWaterford to Cork is a just under two hours so start your day early. And come hungry! The English Market is a must-see and it is full of delicious Irish food. The Farmgate Café is the crown jewel and it’ll fill you up for a day of exploring. 10 Local Foods to Try in IrelandIrish food probably isn’t what you expect (corned beef and cabbage is actually an Irish-American dish)! Check out my 10 local foods to try in Ireland before you go. Read MoreYou could easily spend a couple of days exploring Cork. It’s the second biggest city in Ireland, after Dublin, and it has a lot of offer. If you have time, I’d highly recommend sticking around but, if you are on a time crunch, keep moving. The true magic of Ireland lies in the countryside!Ireland’s most popular tourist attraction, Blarney Castle, is 20 minutes from Cork.Yes, kissing the Blarney Stone is cliché and touristy but do it! If you are already in Cork, it is well worth the detour. There is a famous poem about how kissing the stone will give you that famous Irish gift of gab—which you will experience all over the island in spades!What would a road trip through Ireland be without visiting the Blarney Castle? 😉For one of the best views in Ireland, continue on the two-hour drive from Blarney to Sheep’s Head Peninsula Hike. This two km (just under one mile) walk will take you to the Sheep’s Head Lighthouse where you’ll find a jaw-dropping view of the cliffs over the sea.From the lighthouse, it is a two-hour drive to the town of Killarney. This is the starting point for the Ring of Kerry and an ideal place to lay your head for the night.I detoured to Mizen Head, between Killarney and Cork, and it was one of the highlights of my trip!Helpful Tip: In Ireland, “beach weather” tends to mean cold and ultra windy. Even in summer, you’ll find morning around 50 degrees F with intense winds and periodic rain. Dress in layers and bring a waterproof jacket for days out… Heads up, umbrellas are quickly eaten up and spit out by the seaside winds!   Day 6Ring of KerryThe Ring of Kerry is one of Ireland’s greatest attractions. Touring the Iveragh Peninsula, 179 km (110 miles) circular path winds through the rugged coastal landscape and through the rural seaside villages.While the Ring of Kerry gets all of the attention you’ve got to add on the arguably even more beautiful Ring of Skellig. This 32 km (20 miles) detour is full of unmissable photo ops.It’s best to start early on the Ring of Kerry and go clockwise.The buses will be going this direction and you don’t want to be facing off against them on narrow roads! There are so many gorgeous sites like Skellig Rocks, Valentia Island, Cahergal Stone Fort, Portmagee, Kells, and Cahersiveen. Spend time for an extra stop like Killorglin to try the famous West Coast seafood.It is such a scenic route and one of the best things about going solo is that you can linger anywhere that catches your eye.Go your own pace taking the ring all the way back to Killarney then spend the night there again.Day 7Killarney with a Boat + Biking JourneyFrom Killarney, you can start your day by setting to the sea. Take in the beauty of the Wild Atlantic Way. A boat departs from Ross Castle at 11 am for a 1.5hr cruise of Inisfallen, Brickeen Bridge, Meeting of the Waters, Old Weir Bridge, Long Range, and Upper Lake.Before you go, rent a bike! There are a few options around Killarney where you can grab a bike and they will allow it on the boat for a hybrid day of exploration. The boat will take you over to Lord Brandon’s Cottage by around 12:30 pm. There’s a café and bathrooms over there so you can refresh before you take off.Start your biking journey with the 5 km (3 mi) climb to Gap of Dunloe then slightly longer path down to Kate Kearney’s Cottage where you can take another café break. From there, cycle down the minor roads toward Killarney and back to St. Mary’s Cathedral. You will get back into Killarney around 3:30 pm.It’s a 23 km (14 mi) cycle trip in total so you’ll want to come prepared with food and sunscreen.Once you are back into town, take the short trip out to Aghadoe. The hilltop has sweeping views of Killarney and onto the islands and lakes beyond.Spend the evening at Miltown Malbay. This beautiful little village is one of the premier places in Ireland to take in the local culture of traditional music.Once you are ready to call it a day, I’d recommend one more night in Killarney or nearby.  Cliffs of MoherDay 8Killarney to Galway with stops at White Strand Beach and the Cliffs of MoherStart your morning early for the two-hour drive to White Strand Beach. It is a stunning swimming beach with perfect kayak conditions. Just up the beach, you will find the surfing beach of Doughmore Bay or you can continue on up to Lough Donnell, where you can fish from 1 March to 30 September.Another renowned spot, the Spanish Point, is a gorgeous beach for wandering around and exploring the cove and craggy cliffs.20 minutes up the road from the beach is the quaint town of Ennistymon. Wander the postcard-perfect main street and explore the brightly colored shops and pubs. If you can arrive here by lunchtime, it’s a good spot for a long break.Ireland’s most famous landmark, the Cliffs of Moher, is 20 minutes outside of Ennistymon. You will need ample time for this place.From here you can walk north on the Doolin Trail for a 7 km (4.3 mi) journey or 5.5 km (3.4 mi) southbound down Hags Head. Either way will give you epic views!Arriving at the Cliffs of Moher in the early afternoon will give you ample time to wander around then take in the mesmerizing sunset over the cliffs.You will find a few bed and breakfast around the Cliffs of Moher or you can continue onto Galway, which is about an hour and a half up the coast.Day 9GalwayYou will want at least the better part of a day to explore Galway if not more. It is a very walkable city and it’s easy to simply see where the day takes you.Start off with a walking tour of the Spanish Arch, Galway Cathedral, Hall of Red Earl, Lynch’s Castle, Eyre Square, and Salthill Promenade. If you’re lucky enough to arrive during the weekend, be sure to shop the Galway Market.If you run into some sunshine while you are in Galway, make the most of your time there with a quick trip out of town.Connemara is 15 minutes away and has a lovely hidden beach and shimmering black lakes. Oughterard is 30 minute from Galway and nestled on Ireland’s largest lake, Lough Corrib.While you are exploring the Irish countryside, you will find incredible castles all over the island. They no longer house royalty but are celeb hotspots and are perfect for a night you want to treat yourself!Ashford Castle, an hour north of Galway, is an example of one such place. If you are in the mood for a five-star hotel and seven-course meal, look no further. They also do a cool falconry experience and hawk walk to boot!  Doo Lough ValleyDay 10Doo Lough ValleyIf you spend the night at Ashford Castle, you will want to start the day early and make the most of your time on the ground by exploring the paths and tools in the early morning.However you start your day, Doo Lough Valley is a must.Spanning the R335 between Delphi and Louisburgh in County Mayo, this is a historically rich and stunning spot. Learn about the Doolough Tragedy of 1849 at the Doo Lough Famine Memorial and explore the layers of this dynamic region. It only takes about an hour to drive but plan more time to really take it all in and have a few stops.Once you are ready to stretch your legs, go to Croagh Patrick. This 764 m (2500 ft) tall mountain is the site of St. Patrick’s pilgrimage and his 40-day fast. It takes between three to four hours to climb. While you don’t need equipment, it is a tough hike so bring proper shoes and come ready.When you are ready to take a load off, you’ll find some lovely countryside hotels along with bed and breakfasts. You could also continue onward to Westport, which is about 15 mins up the road.Day 11Westport to Derry with stops at Donegal Castle, Slieve League, and GweedoreStart your day driving up the northwest coastline of Ireland. From Westport to the 15th century Donegal Castle, it is about 2.5 hr. There are a few eye-catching sites along the way, so don’t rush it!The Fairy Bank Walk is a just a mile long from River Eske to Donegal Bay and there are fairy doors hidden throughout!Past Donegal city, you will find the Slieve League. Some of the highest seaside cliffs in Ireland, this place is truly breathtaking. While the Cliffs of Moher tend to steal the show, Slieve League’s cliffs reach are actually three times higher (woah!).Another 40 minutes from Slieve League, you will find one of Ireland’s most beautiful beaches: Maghera Strand. Park in the lot outside of the farm just before the dunes. Walk westward to a rocky promontory full of caves (it may be washed out at high tide so plan accordingly).An hour and a half north of Slieve League is Gweedore, the largest Gaelic-speaking community in Ireland. A world away from Dublin, this is a fascinating place to take in the other side of Irish culture.Continue up the Wild Atlantic Way to the Dunfunaghy Scenic Drive and onto Horn Head with its striking quartzite cliffs.Plan time for Malin Head, AKA Banba’s Crown, Ireland’s northernmost extreme point. Be sure to take a detour over to Pólifreann or Hells Hole too for an unforgettable vista.At the end of the day, it’s an hour drive onto Derry, which is a good place to spend the night so you can start bright and early.  Giant's CausewayDay 12Derry to Belfast with stops at Bushmills, Giant’s Causeway, and Dark HedgesDerry is home to the only surviving city walls in Ireland and you will want at least an hour to walk along them and take in the history.Continue on one hour outside of Derry to Bushmills for a tour of the local whiskey distillery. Try a few samples and learn about the history, then hit the road for Northern Ireland’s greatest site, just ten minutes down the road.The UNESCO World Heritage site of Giant’s Causeway is an essential stop! Take the clifftop path along Shepherd’s Steps to the Amphitheatre Viewpoint at Port Roestan, with a pass by the Organ to Chimney Stacks Headland.From there continue down the Causeway Coast. Explore the beautiful village and Iron Islands of Ballintoy. Cross the long rope bridge then wander the 18th-century beech trees of the Dark Hedges made famous by Game of Thrones.There are quaint little inns all over the North Coast or you can continue down to Belfast to end your night.Day 13Belfast to County MeathStart your day in Belfast with brunch at the late nineteenth century St. George’s Market, the oldest continually operating market around.From there, move to Belfast’s most beloved attraction: the Titanic. The infamous ship was built here and there are truly unique relics that you won’t find elsewhere.In the afternoon, move onto County Meath for an hour and a half drive to the Irish Balloon Flights. You will definitely need to book ahead of time but it’s worth it. Sail through the sky for a view of Ireland like you’ve never had before.Day 14Back to DublinBack to Dublin to say good-bye to your Irish dream! Like all of the cities of Ireland, you could really spend a solid three days exploring to really scratch the surface. If you can sneak in a few hours in Dublin, you’ll find no shortage of things to do.Read More: 10 Things You Must Do in Dublin Have you been to Ireland or are you planning a trip there soon?

It’s even greener than they tell you, the cliffsides are something out of a movie, and the meadows go farther than the eye can see.There’s nothing more awe-inspiring than seeing the Cliffs of Moher in person. Along with the beautiful scenery, the locals are some of the friendliest people I have ever met and go out of their way to make you feel welcome.Did you know the country is split in two? Not physically, but there’s the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland! Both places are EXTREMELY beautiful, but our road trip was in the southern part—in the Republic of Ireland.The hardest part about visiting Ireland is deciding what to do. Between the Guinness Brewery, Giant’s Causeway, the Ring of Kerry, Blarney Castle, the Cliffs of Moher, Dingle Peninsula, and Temple Bar, you will never be bored. And to think, these are just a few things to do!I wasn’t too familiar with local Irish dishes before heading there, either…but my oh my, do they do hearty comfort food right. And alllllll the cheese!Regardless of what sights you decide to see or when you decide to visit, my number one recommendation is to prepare for unpredictable weather with layers! I got lucky when I visited and was met with plenty of sunshine but the country is known for its rainfall. Read my guide about the best time to travel to Ireland to help you decide when the best time to visit is for you!There’s a reason that Ireland is nicknamed the Emerald Isle after all. In fact, they measure their sunshine by the number of hours they get per year (which is typically between 1,100 and 1,500)! Heading there soon?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-ireland/,10 Local Foods to Try in Ireland,Ireland,"When most people think of Irish food, they think of corned beef and cabbage (which is really an Irish-American dish, not a traditional dish found in Ireland, who knew!) or Irish soda bread…and no, I’m not considering beer as a food group for this! But there’s so much more to Irish food than just those things.While potatoes are a plenty, there are quite a few other hearty dishes that you might not be familiar with! Whether you’re heading to Ireland for the first time or wanting to explore Irish cuisine—here are 10 local foods to try in Ireland! And don’t worry, I’m serving up a little guide to ordering beer too! 😉 BoxtyBoxty is a uniquely Irish potato pancake. Talk about two of my favorite things, am I right?Typically fried on a griddle pan and served with a traditional Irish breakfast, boxty is a cheap meal, usually eaten on meager salaries. In fact, its name originates from “arán bocht tí” which is Irish for poor house bread. ColcannonAhh yes, another dish made up of potatoes! Can you tell it’s one of Ireland’s favorite ingredients?Colcannon is a dish that combines mashed potato and kale or cabbage. It’s then seasoned with a little bit of butter, milk, and salt and pepper.It typically acts as a side for boiled ham or you’ll find bacon mixed in with it. It’s such a popular dish that it’s even the topic of a 19th-century folk song! BarmbrackBarmbrack is a sweet Irish bread made with sultanas (a white seedless grape) and raisins and is quite popular during Halloween.During the holiday, items such as coins and rings were added to the dough—and whoever received the prize was considered to be fortunate and have good luck for the coming year.Sounds kind of similar to kings cake, doesn’t it?Today, supermarkets still sell the bread with a toy ring inside to keep tradition going! Barmbrack is also known as ‘tea brack,’ as it goes so well with a warm cup of something sweet. CoddleCoddle is most well-known in Dublin and is essentially a dish of leftovers.I promise it’s tastier than it sounds!Items from other meals like sausage, potatoes, onion, and bacon are combined and steamed and enjoyed by many. It’s the epitome of comfort food in a pot. And who doesn’t love comfort food? Bacon and CabbageThough this is the quintessential dish of St. Patrick’s Day, it can also be enjoyed throughout the year!This dish is exactly what you think it’d be: bacon and cabbage! However, it’s not the American bacon you might be used to. Irish bacon, made from the back of the pig rather than the belly, is cooked along with cabbage and is served with mustard and boiled potatoes. Black and White PuddingIt isn’t the sweet dessert you're thinking of...In Ireland, black and white pudding is definitely a savory dish. Black pudding is a sausage made from blood, meat, fat, oatmeal, and bread or potato fillers. White pudding is the exact same—minus the blood.Okay, so I know a meal made of blood might not sound too appetizing, but it’s definitely worth trying with your Irish breakfast, especially if you’re wanting to sample the local cuisine!    Irish Soda BreadIrish families have been passing down Irish soda bread recipes for generations. Rather than using yeast, soda bread is leavened with baking soda (hence the name!). Other ingredients include flour, buttermilk, and salt, making it one of the easiest Irish recipes to make.It’s best enjoyed when slathered with some Irish butter and accompanied by a cup of tea! Cockles & MusselsWhen in Europe, you have to enjoy some seafood and you can do just that with some cockles and mussels!Cockles and mussels are small saltwater clams usually steamed and served with fries…I mean chips! Irish BreakfastThough big breakfasts are very well-known in England, Ireland has its own full breakfast set up!It generally consists of bacon, sausage, eggs, fried tomatoes, mushrooms, hashbrowns, black and white pudding, and baked beans. And it wouldn’t be complete without some toast and tea.You can count on it soaking up that Guinness hangover! Irish StewI saved the best for last!Irish stew is Ireland’s most well-known dish and it’s both simple and cheap to make. Using ingredients such as potatoes, carrots, onions, and lamb, the stew dates back centuries.If visiting during Ireland’s chilly winter months, eating a bowl of Irish stew will quickly warm you up and make you feel right at home!   Guinness Storehouse in Dublin Drink Up!Bonus TipIt’s no secret that the Irish love their Guinness! And if you go up to the bar and just ask for a pint, you’re going to get served a Guinness. So if you want something else, you’re going to have to specify.If you want to fit in like one of the locals, you can refer to Guinness as “the black stuff.” 😉 OverallIreland is home to some of the best comfort food in the world (alongside some of the best beer) and though it might sound like it’s a little out of your own comfort zone, if you give one of these dishes a shot, you’re going to quickly fall in love with the country’s cuisines.What kind of Irish foods have you sampled?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-ireland/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Ireland,Ireland,"While I had been to Dublin many moons ago, I recently took a road trip around Ireland, and let me tell you, it’s as green as they all say! Talk about craggy coastlines and lush meadows as far as the eye can see! Oh, and my jaw definitely dropped when I got to see Mizen Head and the Cliffs of Moher!I certainly got lucky with all the warm weather I experienced there…though I know that’s not very common! Ireland actually measures their sunshine by the number of hours they get per year—which is typically between 1,100 and 1,500.Before you head to the land of Guinness and gorgeous views of greenery, here are my 10 tips!   Cliffs of MoherUnderstand Lay of the LandsDid you know that Ireland is split in two? I don’t mean physically with one land mass here and the other across the ocean, but rather the divide of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland!The Republic of Ireland is an independent nation that takes up most of the land while Northern Ireland (comprised of six counties) is still a part of the United Kingdom. Now ya know!While I’d highly suggest visiting the big cities (Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Limerick, etc.), the beaches and rugged cliffs are a must-see near the sea! CurrencyThe national currency of Ireland is the euro but if visiting Northern Ireland, you’ll find that they use the pounds sterling.It’s very easy to find an ATM in the big cities..but once you reach the countryside, you’ll find very few. It’s always safe to have some coins on you but you’ll want to spend them before you leave—as you can’t really exchange them anywhere else.My suggestion? Drinks on you! Buy a round of beers at the local pub for you and your mates, that’s the best way to use up the leftover coins.    Wear LayersIreland is known for its unpredictable weather, especially its rainfall.There is a reason it’s nicknamed the Emerald Isle after all! Luckily, you’ll likely experience a mist rather than a torrential downpour. At least, I hope that’s the case!Regardless of when you visit, you’ll want to layer up so you can adapt to the quickly changing weather. I highly recommend a raincoat and waterproof shoes.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Ireland English is the Main LanguageDon’t stress out about learning another language on your flight over. Almost everyone speaks English, though sometimes it might sound quite a bit different because of heavy accents.   Know How to Get AroundIf you’ve never driven in the UK, you’re in for a treat. Unlike the US, the Irish drive on the left side of the road which can take some getting used to. And, to top it off, speed limit signs and distances are measured in kilometers per hour rather than miles per hour.

Order one of these dishes with a beer in a local pub!   Visiting the Guinness Storehouse Drink Up!Ordering a BeerThe Irish love stouts (a dark beer) and when ordering one in a pub, you might hear them refer to it as “the black stuff.” This name especially applies to Guinness. And if you just ask for a pint, you’re going to get served Guinness so if you want something else, you’re going to have to specify. TippingTipping in Ireland is not a given the way that it is in the States. A 10% tip is appropriate in sit-down restaurants, but it’s not necessary to tip bartenders or taxi drivers unless you feel the service has gone above and beyond your expectations. Flag Down Your BusDublin city buses won’t stop...even at a designated stop, unless you flag them down like a taxi!Make sure you stick your arm out when you see your bus approaching so that the driver is aware that you want to hop on.Take Your TimeIreland is a very laid-back country and should be enjoyed in the same manner. Buses tend to be late and if you’re meeting up with a local, don’t count on them showing up on time. Ireland will teach you to slow down and enjoy things that you might have overlooked.Read More: The Ultimate Ireland Travel Guide OverallIreland is home to quaint towns, the friendliest people you will ever meet, breathtaking scenery, and endless amounts of beer and once you experience it, leaving is going to seem nearly impossible.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-guinness-storehouse-dublin/,Visiting the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin,Ireland,"Nearly 6 years ago, I had the opportunity to visit one of the most iconic beer landmarks in the entire world. I was on my first ever trip abroad between my sophomore and junior year of college and had just finished studying abroad in Spain.I planned on backpacking through Europe to visit some of the major tourist destinations. Perhaps it was the fact that I was 19 and could legally drink a cold one, but Dublin was at the top of my list!Instead of boring you to tears with a play-by-play of, albeit, one of the coolest brewery experiences in all my travels, I figured pictures from the experience at the Guinness Storehouse and fun facts about the beer would be much more entertaining.Fun Facts about Guinness:Arthur Guinness, aged 34, signed a 9,000-year lease on a disused brewery at St. James’s Gate, Dublin for an annual rent of £45 on 31st December, 1759. Source  St. James’s Gate Brewery is the biggest stout export brewery in the world. Source  The Guinness Storehouse has only been open to the public since the year 2000. Source  Guinness stout is actually ruby red in color, not black. Source  The harp, which serves as the Guinness emblem, is based on a famous 14th century Irish harp known as the “O’Neill” or “Brian Boru” harp, which is now preserved in the Library of Trinity College Dublin. Source  The Guinness Brewery purchases about two-thirds of the malting barley grown in Ireland every year. Source  Through much of the 20th century, doctors thought Guinness had medicinal properties. “Guinness is good for you” was launched in 1929 as the official Guinness tagline and was the foundation of the brand for another 40 years. Source  The Guinness Book of Records came from Sir Hugh Beaver, the Managing Director of Guinness in the 1950s. This ‘fact’ book was first published to settle nightly debates in pubs in Britain and Ireland. Source  The Guinness Gravity Bar offers a 360-degree view of the city and is the highest bar in Dublin. Source  Pouring a “perfect pint” of Guinness is an art form. The glass is held at a 45 degree angle, the tap handle is pulled toward the pourer to the full horizontal position and the glass is filled to three quarters. The crucial element, at this point, is letting the glass rest for exactly 119.5 seconds. Then, to create the legendary head on a Guinness, the pourer pushes the handle away slightly and serves without spilling a drop. Source  10 million glasses of Guinness are enjoyed every day around the world! And nearly 40% of those beers are consumed… in Africa! Who knew?!

This place of mass genocide has since been revamped into a garden and the important places are highlighted.The Wagah Border is the border of India and Pakistan. Travelers can come to watch the evening performance of both the armies which will definitely give you goosebumps! The Indian border guards then appear in khaki uniforms and plumage-like hats, while the Pakistan soldiers dress in black. After the patriotic scream-offs, both guards march towards the border gate, stomping heavily and kicking high. The daily ceremony is normally held around 4:30 pm in winters and 5:30 pm in summers throughout the year. You will need to show your passport at the entrance since it is on the border.How to Get There: To get to the Golden Temple, you’ll fly into Amritsar Airport or take a train into Amritsar station.Days Required: ~4 days   Nongriat, MeghalayaNongriat, MeghalayaKnown For: Mountains, hiking, botanical architectureNongriat is about 12 km from Cherrapunjee, and has one of the most beautiful living root bridges that’s about 250 years old! The locals molded the roots of the Ficus elastica tree to form a bridge so they could easily reach the villages.The one in Nongriat has natural pools to swim and relax in after a downward trek of 3000+ steps. Another trek of 2 hours will lead you to Rainbow Falls—which as you might have guessed by the name almost always has an incredible rainbow!Days Required: ~3 daysGetting AroundBusesBuses are extremely popular in India. Both Goibibo and Redbus are the best sites to use for booking buses. These sites have options ranging from public state transportation to private buses. Prices range from $10-$20 USD, depending on where you’d like to go.TrainsTrains are another common mode of transportation. You can find information on IRCTC, the government website for the railway system. Parita suggests booking 3AC/2AC or 1AC if you’re traveling by train. Sleeper class is always a great option for shorter rides, as tickets start as low as $3 USD.CarsOla and Uber work best for internal travel throughout the cities. If you find yourself on a road trip, you can rent a car with a driver through Savaari Rentals or MakeMyTrip. If you’d like to drive yourself, ZoomCar is a great car rental option.MetrosCurrently, 10 Indian cities have functional metro-rail networks. These cities are Kolkata, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Kochi, and Lucknow.  Best  Time to VisitIndia is suitable for year-round exploration. However, I would suggest sticking to Leh and Spiti during the monsoon months (June through September), and all the other places from October to March. OverallHave you been to India before?

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-iceland-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Iceland on a Budget,Iceland,"Iceland is one of the best destinations in the world for all types of travelers, but it’s also expensive. While you’ll need more in your daily budget to pay for daily living expenses, it’s possible to explore the island on a shoestring.Here are my top tips for visiting Iceland on a budget!    Visit Iceland as a LayoverYou can get a free stopover in Iceland with Iceland Air. It’s a natural air route between North America and Europe, giving you the chance to explore one of the world’s top travel destinations for a few days.With so much to see within close distance of Rejkavik, you don’t need that long to see Iceland’s major highlights. You can explore the famous Ring Road and the Blue Lagoon in 24 hours!If you’re traveling on a budget, look out for cheap airfares on Icelandair—they often have super affordable flights from the U.S to Iceland.Read More: How to Make the Most of an Iceland Stopover Travel to Iceland in a GroupOne of the easiest ways to cut costs on travel to Iceland is by planning a group trip. You can split costs for an apartment, car rental, and food, making it a more affordable destination than if you had to explore Iceland as a solo traveler.If you are planning a trip to Iceland alone, don’t let the prices scare you off.  Iceland is an incredible country to explore as a solo traveler; you just need to have a bigger budget for daily expenses.Read More: The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Iceland Buy Duty-Free AlcoholOne of your biggest expenses in Iceland will be alcohol. With high taxes on the spirits, beers, and wines, you’ll end up paying a lot more for a drink than you would back home.The best way to get around this is to buy your alcohol in the duty-free shops on arrival at Keflavík International Airport. Otherwise, you can have a self-imposed “dry” vacation to cut back on costs.Make Your Own FoodDuring my first trip to Iceland, I stayed in an Airbnb and on my second trip we hired a campervan. Both times, I prepared two meals a day.For breakfast, I usually ate skyr yogurt (it’s a local Icelandic brand that is delicious and inexpensive) with some granola, then depending on my itinerary for the day, I’d either make a packed lunch or cook myself dinner.By only eating out once a day at cafes and restaurants, you’ll have more room in your budget to splurge on activities!Read More: Eating Rotten Shark in Iceland Stay at Bed & BreakfastsYou’ll save a lot of money by staying in Bed & Breakfasts rather than at hotels. Look for guest houses that include breakfast, so it’s another meal that you don’t have to worry about.    Visiting the Blue LagoonIf you’re planning to do the Ring Road, consider going to the Myvatn Nature Baths rather than the Blue Lagoon.If your heart is set on the Blue Lagoon, I recommend getting the cheapest “Comfort Level” package. It includes your base admission, and you can use all the mud you want at the lagoon.To get your money’s worth, I would go first thing in the morning and stay until it closes.Read More: Visiting the Blue Lagoon in Iceland  Seljalandsfoss WaterfallDrink the Tap WaterIceland has some of the cleanest water in the world. You can pretty much drink straight from any stream or tap you come across in the country.So, when you’re packing for your trip to Iceland, make sure you bring along a reusable water bottle.

Alternatively, it can be cheaper to join a tour if you’re not going to do the full Ring Road and rather base yourself in Reykjavik.Before booking a tour or renting a car, add up the costs and see which one is the most cost-effective for your itinerary.Read More: The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road Itinerary     Visit Iceland in the Low SeasonWhile Iceland has become a popular destination to visit year-round, some seasons are still cheaper than others. If you’re looking to cut costs as much as possible, plan your trip to the Icelandic nation in the winter (November to March).You won’t be able to drive the full Ring Road in the dead of winter as most of the roads will be snowed in. But you can still explore Reykjavik, and you’ll have a better chance of seeing the Northern Lights.If you’d rather avoid the snow, visit Iceland during its two shoulder seasons. From September to October, and April to May room rates drop, and you’ll find fewer crowds at the top attractions.Both times I’ve gone in October, and I’ve had really good experiences!Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Iceland OverallA trip to Iceland doesn’t have to break the bank.

Home to incredible landscapes, a low crime rate and an endless list of adventurous things to do, Iceland is perfect for seasoned, first-time, and solo travelers.Whether it’s diving in the Silfra Fissure, climbing glaciers or road tripping around the Ring Road in Iceland, there’s always something new and exciting to discover! But, before you book your tickets and pack your bags, there are a few important things you need to know.Here are my 10 tips for your first trip to Iceland!   Use Your Card Instead of CashIcelanders tend to pay for everything using credit or debit cards so you don’t need to worry about carrying cash on you.  I would recommend a travel credit card with zero foreign transaction fees as well as a debit card so you can withdraw money from ATMs and pay for any cash purchases that arise.HELPFUL TIP: If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card.My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!   Goðafoss WaterfallYou Don’t Need to TipYou don’t need to tip in Iceland. It’s not expected by staff at hotels, restaurants or taxi drivers. Instead, you’ll find that most of your bills will already include a gratuity or service charge.    Explore Iceland at NightIf you’re visiting Iceland in the summer months, you’ll have longer days to explore the country. In June, the sun sets as late as midnight and rises again around 3 am!While this might mess with your internal clock at first, it means that you can easily avoid the crowds of other tourists by going to top attractions in the evening. Plus, you’ll also be able to pack more into your itinerary!The only downside is that you won’t be able to see the Northern Lights during summer months. If this is something you’re dying to see, plan your trip between October and March!Read More: The Ultimate Iceland Travel Guide   Jökulsárlón Glacier LagoonHow to Get Around IcelandCampervanIf you’re planning to explore the whole island, I highly recommend hiring a campervan in Iceland! You’ll save money on accommodation, and it’s the best way to explore the country’s famous Ring Road!Rent a CarIn the warmer seasons, you can rent a normal car in Iceland and still plan a road trip around the country. Keep in mind that although there are a lot of car rental companies in Reykjavik, the cars book out quickly, especially the cheaper options.Helpful Tip: Most cars in Iceland have manual transmission so, if you need an automatic, be sure to book well in advance! There are limited quantities.ToursIf you’d rather have someone else handle all the logistics for your trip to Iceland, book a spot on an organized tour. My favorite tour company for day trips is Arctic Adventures. You can base yourself in Reykjavik and join a variety of small group day tours.Explore Iceland’s many glaciers and lava caves, chase the Northern Lights or dive the Silfra Fissure!Read More: Tips for Driving Iceland’s Ring Road    Pack for All Kinds of WeatherIt doesn’t matter if you’re visiting Iceland in the spring, summer, autumn or winter, the island’s weather is always unpredictable.

The Blue LagoonVisit the Blue Lagoon First or LastThe Blue Lagoon in Iceland is a geothermal spa and is one of the country’s top destinations. It’s beautiful blue waters, and mineral-rich clay attract thousands of people each year.If you want to go, I suggest leaving it for the end of your trip.

But, the downside is that most of the roads are closed, making it hard to get around.In my opinion, October is the best month to visit Iceland. I experienced all four seasons in one day and I was lucky enough to see the Northern Lights!Helpful Tip: Do not base your entire trip on seeing the Aurora.

https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-iceland/,Exploring Iceland,Iceland,"Iceland is one of those out-of-this-world destinations where adventure is found around every corner. I’ve seen all stretches of this country from both above and below.Iceland is a country that is becoming an increasingly popular destination for people who are looking for different and diverse experiences. Whether you want to see glaciers, volcanoes, or the Northern Lights, there is certainly no shortage of attractions and interesting experiences that you can enjoy.I created a few videos while exploring Iceland to document a few of my craziest moments!Golden Circle Road TripDriving Iceland’s Golden Circle is an amazing experience, and can be explored in as little as a few hours- (although I would recommend going for as long as possible). The circular route covers about 300 kilometers and loops from Reykjavík into central Iceland and back.The route takes you through some of the most amazing sights in central Iceland, with scenery ranging from natural sites to historic buildings, and gives visitors the chance to experience the diversity of Iceland in a relatively short trip.Read Next: The Ultimate Guide to Driving Iceland’s Golden CircleScuba Diving in IcelandThe Silfra Fissure is one of the most incredible dive destinations on earth, so it was an absolute MUST when I went to Iceland. Silfra is the only place in the world where you can dive between continental plates. The water is also nearly freezing (2°C – 4°C year round) as it comes from the Langjökull glacier.I usually dive in more tropical destinations so it was such a cool experience to dive somewhere a bit chillier!Read Next: Diving the Silfra Fissure in IcelandEating Rotten SharkKæstur hákarl aka “Rotten Shark” is a traditional Icelandic delicacy that dates back to the time of the vikings. Since vegetation is sparse in Iceland, locals have had to get “creative” with where and how they find food.Greenland Sharks are actually toxic so they need to be processed before eating. It was definitely the worst food I’ve ever tried, but the smell was even more intense than the taste… watch more above!Read Next: Eating Rotten Shark in Iceland "
https://theblondeabroad.com/eating-rotten-shark-in-iceland/,Eating Rotten Shark in Iceland,Iceland,"OK, I know what you’re thinking, but I highly recommend trying out new foods when you travel. The cuisine is so closely tied to culture, and some of my best memories have been made while breaking bread around the world.From fried bugs to rotten fish, there are so many crazy and incredible foods to try. While some of them are truly awful, some are tastier than you might think.On my most recent trip driving Iceland’s Ring Road, we stopped into the town of Blönduós to try the “national dish of Iceland,” Kæstur hákarl, also known as a fermented or rotten shark.Hungry? Here’s what you should know about eating rotten shark at Ektafiskur in Iceland.The BasicsRotten Shark, or kæstur hákarl as it is known in the Icelandic language, is a traditional delicacy in Iceland that dates back to the time of the Vikings. While it might not be at the top of your must-eat list, it has always made practical sense in the kitchens of Iceland.One of my fave spots, Iceland has a lot of stunning natural wonders. It does not, however, have much in terms of vegetation. Since farmland is sparse and conditions are harsh, the people of Iceland have always had to be creative when it comes to food.This is where the rotten shark enters the picture.While it may seem like a strange thing to eat, it makes perfect sense in the fish-heavy diet of Iceland. Although Iceland has some amazing seafood right off its shores, the shark isn’t exactly sushi ready. In fact, Greenland Sharks are actually toxic.This means that they need to be processed before eating. Typically, the shark is cured with a traditional fermentation process and then dried for four to five months until ready. This process leaves it with a UNIQUE taste and smell…Note: Greenland sharks are not a threatened species, and Iceland produces very small quantities of it. Just because it’s not a “normal” food doesn’t make it wrong. It’s sustainable, and it’s what they have access to in the far north.What Rotten Shark Tastes LikeCeleb chef Anthony Bourdain described Iceland’s rotten fish as “the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing” he has ever eaten. And I have to agree!It wasn’t the flavor that was even the worst part though. The smell was more intense than anything else. It reminded me of a mix of hair bleach, rotten fish, and blue cheese.Rotten Shark at Ektafiskur in BlönduósWe went on the Ektafiskur Experience tour, and it was unlike anything else I’ve ever experienced. Eating your way into the infamous “The Rotten Shark Club of Hauganes” is one of the highlights of the tour, but it’s not the only thing that they do at Ektafiskur.This place is most famous for keeping the traditional salted cod industry alive. While nearly every little town in Iceland used to make this savory treat, the Blönduós facility is one of the few places still keeping the industry afloat.The host of the Ektafiskur Experience tour, Elvar Reykjalin, brings the whole experience to life (watch my video!). He will give you insight into Nordic life and tell you more than you ever thought you wanted to know about the fishing and seafood industry.Once you’ve seen it all, stick around for the delicious fish soup, and take in the spectacular view from the shores of Blönduós.Helpful Tip: Like many things in Iceland, the restaurant at Ektafiskur, Baccalá Bar, is closed during the winter. If you arrive after September 1, you’ll need to have a group booking to visit.Other Things to Do in Blönduós, IcelandThe small town of Blönduós in northern Iceland is a popular spot, and it is where I first encountered rotten shark. The quaint town is home to the country’s only handcraft museum and other cool attractions, such as the Sea Ice Exhibition Center, the Icelandic Textile Center, and a sports center.There’s also a spot to rent horses to explore the gorgeous surrounding countryside of Blönduós. I recommend taking an afternoon to go horseback riding down the scenic trails. The horses and guides alike are friendly, so it’s approachable for complete beginners.All photos in this post were edited with #TBAPresets.

Very cold. Temperatures are in the twenties to thirties (fahrenheit) in the winter; even the warmest summer afternoons rarely reach sixty degrees.July and August are the best time to visit because you’ll have ample sunshine and fairly good weather. Consider September and October too because the prices are lower, and you’ll have a better shot of seeing the Northern Lights.Read More: The Best Time to Go to Iceland Get PreppedCamper Van: We picked up our 5-person camper van from Happy Campers. If you’re planning to travel the Ring Road in a camper van, keep in mind that size matters! When we are talking about comfort and gas consumption (gas is expensive!), the size of your camper van is important, so you will want to give some real consideration to which camper you choose.Read More: How to Survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a Camper VanDay OneReykjavik to Hellishólar // Without Stops: 1 hour 30 minutes (111 km) via Route 1After picking up our campervan in Reykjavik, we stopped at a grocery store to stock up on food for the trip, then hit the road!Stop at Hveragerði (30-minute drive): Located less than thirty miles to the east of Reykjavík, Hveragerði is the first place to brake for. Thanks to its amazing geothermal pool, this little town is one of Iceland’s most popular tourist destinations.There’s hiking, geothermal pools, and horseback riding.Stay at Hellishólar Campground (1-hour drive): This campground is first class. It has full toilets, hot showers, and even Jacuzzis. If you’re in the mood for a more luxe night, you can stay in one of the cottages and, during the summer, check out the restaurant!Hellishólar is just a 30-minute drive to Seljalandsfoss, so you can get an early start in the morning!Seljalandsfoss WaterfallSkógafoss WaterfallSeljavallalaug Swimming PoolDay TwoHellishólar to Vik // Without Stops: 1 hour 30 minutes (91 km) via Route 1Stop at Seljalandsfoss Waterfall (30-minute drive): This waterfall originates from the volcano glacier Eyjafjallajökull and falls 200 feet. You can walk into a cave behind the waterfall to take pics of this impressive waterfall. There’s another smaller waterfall about 650 feet off to the left, so spend your time exploring.Swim at Seljavallalaug (20-minute drive): Take a detour off of Ring Road toward Seljadalur, the oldest swimming pool in Iceland. Turn off of the main road onto Road 242 (marked Raufarfell). It is located right after Þorvaldseyri, so keep your eyes peeled when you see that sign.Stop at Skógafoss (10-minute drive): Walk to the top of Skogafoss waterfall for incredible views of one of Iceland’s most famous waterfalls.Trek to Solheimasandur Plane Crash (allow a few hours to visit): The Solheimasandur plane crash is the remains of a disaster from the 1970s, and it has some amazing photo ops. It’s an extra two to three hours off of the main road and requires an 8km/5 mile walk round trip. Because it is no longer accessible by car and conditions were cold, windy and rainy, we decided to skip it.Sunset at Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach (30-minute drive from Skógafoss): About half a mile off the main road in the remote seafront village of Vík, you’ll find the striking basalt columns lining the Reynisfjara black sand beach.Stay in Skógar at Skógafoss: The campsite in Vík is only open 1 May – 31 October (and is usually crowded), so depending on what time of year you are visiting and what time of day you finish at the black sand beach, it might be worth driving back to Skógafoss. It’s a pretty basic campsite for 1,000 króna ($10 USD) per person overnight. There are toilets and showers you can use for 300 króna ($2.80 USD) for five minutes. The biggest benefit of camping here was being able to wake up just before sunrise and be the first people at the waterfall!FjaðrárgljúfurSvartifoss WaterfallJökulsárlón Glacier LagoonDay ThreeSkógar to Jökulsárlón // Without Stops: 2 hours 50 minutes (226 km) via Route 1Stock up: We stopped back in Vík to get supplies and restock everything. There’s a grocery store called Kjarval, a liquor store and a couple of wool shops.Helpful Tip: When you’re in Iceland, never wait to stock up. Amenities can be few and far between, so you never want to be down to your last liter of gas or morsel of food. Keep a steady supply of the essentials. Also, Iceland has some of the BEST water in the world, so refill your bottles at every campsite!Stop at Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon (50-minute drive from Vík): This absolutely stunning site is only a couple minutes off the main road. Follow Road 206, and turn before the village of Kirkjubæjarklaustur. Plan plenty of time to take pics!Hike to Svartifoss (1-hour drive): This black waterfall is located in Vatnajökull National Park. There is a year-round visitor center in Skaftafell, and it has information on how to make your way to the waterfall. There’s also a nice cafeteria. Allow a couple hours to visit because it requires a hike to get to the waterfall.You’ll also find Þjófafoss (Thieves’ Fall), Hundafoss (Dogs’ Fall), and Magnúsarfoss (the Falls of Magnús).Explore Breidamerkurjokull Glacier: You will see this glacier just outside the Svartifoss visitor center! With an otherworldly beauty, this “glacial tongue” extends into the glacier lagoon Jökulsárlón from the southern part of Vatnajöku National Park. In the Winter, you can explore incredible ice caves here with guided tours.Sunset at Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon (45-minute drive from Svartifoss): Jökulsárlón is located on the southeastern coast just beyond Vatnajöku National Park, and the sunsets here are mesmerizing. Keep in mind, though, that they can be as late as midnight during the summer.Stay at Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon: You can do wild (free) camping here and wake up with an epic view. Camping is only allowed in camper vans and there are no toilets. Waking up at sunrise to a view of the glacier lagoon was one of the biggest highlights of the Ring Road for me!Iceberg BeachIceland’s Eastern CoastDay FourJökulsárlónt to Egilsstadir // Without Stops: 4 hours 30 minutes (335 km) via Route 1Stop at Iceberg Beach: After you pack up to leave Jökulsárlón Iceberg Lagoon, be sure to cross Route 1 to explore the iceberg beach.Stop at Höfn (1-hour drive): A few minutes off the Ring Road, the quaint little fishing village of Höfn has been the set of some famous Hollywood movies. It has some interesting museums and of course, ultra fresh seafood.Drive the Coast: The Ring Road runs right along the eastern coast of Iceland and offers some of the most impressive views of the journey. You’ll find stunning mountains all around, including the Vesturnhorn Mountain right off the road.This drive is VERY windy so be cautious when opening your car doors and peeing outdoors 😉Stop at Egilsstadir (3 hours 30 minutes drive from Höfn): Route 1 becomes very steep and isn’t paved, so I suggest taking the 92/96 coastal drive instead. Be sure to check road conditions to determine the best road to take.Optional: Hengifoss Waterfall (allow a few hours to hike): We didn’t make it to the Hengifoss waterfall, but if you want to, you can take the 931 southwest from Egilsstadir on about an hour drive. The hike to the waterfall from the road is about two hours, so plan accordingly.Stop at Seyðisfjörður Village: East of Egilsstaði, this village is a twenty-five-minute drive down road 93. The little town is full of colorful wooden houses and has a thriving arts scene.Dinner at Salt Café & Bistro: Get to Egilsstadir for this tasty spot with good variety. There aren’t really any other restaurants in town, but Netto is an excellent place to shop and do some stocking up.Stay at Egilsstaðastofa Campground: This campground is located in the center of town and has hot showers and laundry facilities for 1,500 króna ($14 USD) per person per night. It’s a good spot to refresh!Helpful Tip: Eastern Iceland is home to many sheep and reindeer, so pay attention to the road!Godafoss WaterfallGodafoss WaterfallNamafjall Geothermal FieldMyvatn Nature BathsDay FiveEgilsstadir to Akureyri // Without Stops: 4 hours 30 minutes (330 km) via Route 1This is a long day that you could break up into two more relaxed days if you wanted to spend more time in Myvatn.Stop at Dettifoss (2-hour drive): After two hours of driving, we got to Vatnajökull National Park in Northeast Iceland to visit Dettifoss, which is the most powerful waterfall in Europe. It’s a forty-mile round-trip detour from Route 1, but it was worth it!Stop at Namafjall (1-hour drive): We made a quick stop at the Namafjall geothermal field, located east of Lake Myvatn, to check out the mud pools and steams.Explore Myvatn (10-minute drive): There is a lot to see in the area, from lava fields to nature baths. Plan ample time to explore the lava fields of Dimmuborgir, the Grjótagjá Cave from Game of Thrones, and the Hverir and Hverarond geothermal sites as well as the Myvatn Nature Baths.The Myvatn Nature Baths are cheaper and less crowded, but just as beautiful as the famous Blue Lagoon in the south!Sunset at Goðafoss (40-minute drive): Goðafoss is also one of Iceland’s most famous waterfalls, and it has a neat history. According to local legend, when Iceland became a Christian country, all the statues of the Norse gods were thrown into this waterfall, hence the translated name of “Waterfall of the Gods.”We arrived before sunset and stayed well into the evening as the Northern Lights showed up and gave us an incredible show!Stay in Akureyri (45-minute drive) OR Stay in Myvatn (40-minute drive): About forty-five minutes from Goðafoss, there’s a quiet little camp in Akureyri that is open until October 15 each year. If you show up late (like we did) and there’s no attendant, simply read the instructions or give the camp a call with any questions. You’ll also find lots of guesthouses and hostels around Akureyri.Helpful Tip: The northern lights are visible anywhere on the Ring Road, but I had the best luck along the north side of the country. Be on the lookout!Read More: The Beginner’s Guide to Photographing the Northern LightsTown of AkureyriIcelandic Horses!DalvíkDay SixAkureyri to Blönduós // Without Stops: 2-3 Hours (141-218 km) via Route 1 or the CoastExplore Akureyri: This was our day to relax, so we lingered in town to explore. It’s a lovely little town with museums, galleries, and exhibitions. The available volcano flights and whale-watching tours out of Akureyri can also make for perfect day trips.We went for breakfast at Cafe Berlin and tried the quiche with avocado. It’s a tasty spot and you’ll want to be sure to grab something you can put jam on—you’ll find delicious local spreads there!I had to make a stop at the doctor in town. If you happen to be in need of medical attention, stop at Akureyri Primary Health Care Centre at Hafnarstræti 99, third to sixth floor; Phone: +354 460 4600.Helpful Tip: Iceland is a captivating country, but it’s not known for smelling great. The natural phenomena that make the country remarkable are often rich with sulfur, which smells like rotten eggs. And, while we had a blast in Akureyri, be forewarned that the place smells like cows.There are a few routes to get to Blönduós from Akureyri—along Route 1, or the coastal highway past Siglufjörður.Coastal Route: You’ll need to leave Akureyri earlier in the day to make the most of this route.Try Rotten Shark at Ektafiskur (20 minute drive): Kæstur hákarl aka “Rotten Shark” is a traditional Icelandic delicacy that dates back to the time of the vikings. Since vegetation is sparse in Iceland, locals have had to get “creative” with where and how they find food. Ektafiskur is owned by a hilarious Icelandic guy and makes the entire experience super fun!Visit Bruggsmidjan Brewery (5-minute drive): It’s thirty minutes north of Akureyri in Dalvik, and it’s a detour you can’t miss. Take the time for a beer bath if you can.Stop at Siglufjörður (1-hour drive): It was too late for us to stop in this super cute fishing town, but it’s a place to consider for your trip. You could spend a day in this haven for winter sports skiing, slaloming, skating, or snowmobiling.Stay in Blönduós (2-hour & 30-minute drive): We decided to make the long haul drive after dark so we could get an early start the next morning. It’s a long drive to Arnarstapi, so I suggest breaking up the drive by staying in Blönduós. The campground here has showers and toilets; you can also upgrade to the Gladheimar Cottages.Kirkjufellsfoss WaterfallArnarstapiDay SevenBlönduós to Arnarstapi // Without Stops: 3 hours 20 minutes (285 km) via Route 1 and 54Stock Up: Get your gas and food in the morning before you start the drive to Arnarstapi. There are no toilets, gas, or shops here, so you’ll want to be 100 percent prepared on arrival.Road Trip Games: We chose to take the coastal drive west from Blönduós, which was a fairly dull route. It’s mostly gravel roads across a flat and bare terrain. Bring your best road trip games or podcasts to keep it lively.Seal Watching: The two-and-a-half-hour trip to Grundarfjörður is a scenic coastal route, and you’ll want to look for seals as you go along.Sunset at Kirkjufellsfoss: In the north, you’ll see the mountain peak Kirkjufell, and just off the main road, there’s another famous waterfall, Kirkjufellsfoss.Stay in Arnarstapi: We parked here for a free night of wild camping. There’s also a guesthouse nearby along with a restaurant that is open during the summer.Detour to the WestfjordsIf you want to expand your trip, spend a few days exploring this remote area. There’s rough hiking near the Dynjandi waterfall and you can bundle up for a long walk along the red beach of Rauðasandur.ArnarstapiArnarstapi Sea ArchDay EightArnarstapi to Reykjavik //  Without Stops: 2 hours 30 minutes (226 km) via Route 54 and 1We spent the morning exploring Arnarstapi, and it has some dream photo ops. The Gatklettur Arch Rock and statue of Bárður Snæfellsás make this little town one of a kind. The photo of me walking on the sea arch is a different arch from Gatklettur Arch Rock. Start your walk at the main visitor’s center and you’ll eventually stumble upon it.Once you’re ready to hit the road, you’ll return to Route 1 to finish the Ring Road to ReykjavikOptional — Snæfellsnes Peninsula: If you have the time to explore, this peninsula is home to the Snæfellsjökull volcano, a powerful symbol of Iceland, as well as some extraordinary lava fields and waterfalls. You’ll want to take your time wandering through this area.DETOUR — Chasing Waterfalls (2-hour drive): Iceland has an insane amount of waterfalls, and each one is more beautiful than the last. Hraunfossar, a series of waterfalls, and Barnafoss, a legendary spot in Icelandic folk tales, are must-sees.Optional — Stay in the Bjarteyjarsandur Campsite: After a chill day of wandering the peninsula, you can spend the night beside the Bjarteyjarsandur Farm, which is the ultimate place to have the real Icelandic sheep-farming experience.Return to Reykjavik (2-hour & 30-minute drive from Arnarstapi): We made the full drive back to Reykjavik and camped at the Reykjavik Campsite. It’s a really nice campsite two miles from the center of the city. It’s 2,200 króna per person ($20 USD or less if you stay longer). It is indeed pricey for a campsite, but you can use the Wi-Fi, a kitchen, a shower, and the laundry facilities.Helpful Tip: Unfortunately, in the safest country I’ve ever been in, I had my camera stolen from the bathroom at the Reykjavik Campsite while I was showering. This is a great campsite but do not leave your camper unlocked or belongings unattended. This incident is also NOT a reflection of Iceland and I take responsibility for being an easy target by leaving my items outside of my shower stall. Always be responsible!Scuba Diving in the Silfra FissureKerið CraterGarður LighthouseDay NineThe Golden Circle // Without Stops: 3 hours 30 minutes (240 km)The Golden Circle: This is a smaller day-trip you can take out of Reykjavik but you could spend a good week checking out this fascinating part of Iceland too. I’ve done two trips to Iceland, and I’m still in awe.Go diving, take in the geysers, stop at the Kerið Crater Lake, and see the Icelandic horses throughout Thingvellir National Park. Also known as Þingvellir, or Thingvellir, this park sits in a rift valley and is the former home to Iceland’s parliament.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Driving Iceland’s Golden CircleVisit Garður Lighthouse (1-hour drive from Reykjavik): The Folk Museum in Garður & Lighthouses is a gorgeous site and is a good spot to find insight into the local culture and lore.Stay in Garður at the Gardskagi Campsite: The site offers toilets and sinks (but no shower) for 1,000 króna per person ($9 USD). The sunsets and sunrises are incredible here. We also got lucky and saw an incredible display of the Northern Lights! Garður LighthouseBlue LagoonDay TenGardur to The Blue Lagoon // Without Stops: 1 hour 15 minutes (57 km)Tea at Garður Lighthouse: Head inside the lighthouse in the morning and request a cup of tea and a seat at the top of the light in the lighthouse!Blue Lagoon: Fifteen minutes from the international airport and forty-five minutes from central Reykjavík, the Blue Lagoon is one of Iceland’s greatest treasures and the BEST place to finish your epic Ring Road road trip in Iceland. If you’re flying out this day, you can return your camper and spend the rest of the day at the spa before taking a shuttle to the airport.I always leave the Blue Lagoon for my very last day in Iceland and spend the ENTIRE day there relaxing and reflecting on my incredible adventures. I highly recommend enjoying lunch in the spa restaurant and soaking up the healing benefits of the geothermal pools.Read More: Visiting the Blue Lagoon in IcelandIf I learned anything during my trip to Iceland, it’s to keep it flexible.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-driving-icelands-ring-road/,Tips for Driving Iceland’s Ring Road,Iceland,"Easily one of the most beautiful countries in the world and among the most underrated European destinations, Iceland is one of my favorite places.The ultimate getaway for adventurers and nature lovers alike, Iceland is best experienced by road trip. I experienced Iceland’s famous Ring Road in a camper van, and it was unlike anything else I’ve ever done.Highway 1, a.k.a. Ring Road, is the main route around the country, and there are so many stunning sights and worthwhile detours there. Are you ready to hit the road?Here are my tips for driving Iceland’s Ring Road. Best Time to Drive the Ring RoadAs its name implies, Iceland is a colder country. Temperatures are in the twenties to thirties in the winter, while even the hottest afternoons of July rarely reach sixty degrees.July and August are great months to visit because you’ll have more sunshine and the best weather of the year. September and October are also good because the prices are lower, and you’ll have a better shot of seeing the Northern Lights.Personally, my Ring Road adventure was in early October and I thought it was an awesome time to go. We did have a few rainy days, but had amazing light for photography, saw the Northern Lights, and it wasn’t too, too cold!Read More: The Best Time to Go to Iceland Weather and Road ConditionsWhen you’re driving in Iceland, the weather guides your day. It’s important to check the weather conditions every morning and keep a flexible schedule. You can be driving on a sunny day one minute and then be stuck in a whiteout blizzard the next.While a week will give you flexibility to see and do the essentials in the summer, you’ll want to plan for closer to two weeks in the winter. That’ll give you enough time to get snowed in a few times and still get around to everything.Beware of wind! It’s so strong that it can damage car doors (been there!), so always use caution. Drive it YourselfYou can drive the Ring Road yourself or go on a guided tour. Public transportation isn’t practical in Iceland, so you’ll need to make sure you make solid plans.Consider driving yourself because it maximizes your options and gives you the most flexibility. You can stop wherever you want for as long as you want when you’re solo. Privacy is also a huge bonus, and you can camp out anywhere.Read More: How to Survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a Camper Van Get a Physical MapRather than relying exclusively on your phone, it’s best to have a physical map with you. We used our map a lot; it’s the most reliable method, and it gives you a good sense of where you are in the country. Rent a Good Camper VanI rented my van from Happy Campers, and I highly recommend the company. Happy Campers staff was AWESOME with helping to plan the itinerary and will give you essential insider knowledge about getting around Iceland.I shared a van with one other person and opted for a five-person camper van because we had a lot of luggage and photography gear, and it had plenty of space for everything.Read More: How to Survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a Camper Van Stay ConnectedWhen you arrive in Iceland, you’ll want to get a local SIM card or pick up a Skyroam hotspot before your trip. I used my Skyroam hotspot during my entire Icelandic adventure, and it worked perfectly.For a limited time, get an unlimited Skyroam subscription for $99/month!You can connect up to five devices on Skyroam, which makes it a cheap and easy option for sharing a connection.Read More: Why You Need to Travel with a Wi-Fi Hotspot CampgroundsIt’s best to make plans for your campsite since many sites are not maintained year-round. Typically, you can still camp there 365 days a year, but you might not have facilities like toilets available.When they are open, most campsites are very well equipped. They have showers, laundry rooms, and sometimes even perks like Wi-Fi and Jacuzzis.When you rent your camper van, you will get a campsite map. It is priceless. Hang on to it.We found that it was easier in most cases just to call ahead and inquire if a campground was open or had spots available, rather than spending time looking online! Don’t Stick to a Hard ItineraryAbove all else, keep it flexible. The best part of Iceland for me was the laid-back pace. There are so many peaceful places that are a million miles from anything. It’s a dream destination for simply sitting back and taking in the incredible natural beauty.You will want an open schedule so that you can see the Northern Lights; their visibility is far from a sure thing. You’ll need to watch the Northern Lights forecast for each area and adjust accordingly if you want to catch the magical moment.However, some days require lots of driving, so I’d recommend getting an early start each morning—you’ll catch the best light and beat the crowds!Read More: The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road Itinerary "
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-beginners-guide-to-photographing-the-northern-lights/,The Beginner’s Guide to Photographing the Northern Lights,Iceland," On my most recent trip to Iceland, I saw the Northern Lights for the first time and it was INCREDIBLE! As amazing as the lights look in photos, nothing will prepare you for seeing such an overwhelmingly beautiful sight in person.The Northern Lights are definitely a phenomenon you’re going to want to catch on camera. To take a great pic, I highly recommend bringing a good camera with you (I never go anywhere with my Fujifilm X-T2) and learning a few tricks before you get there.While I’m not a professional, I do love learning new photography skills and have picked up a lot of useful tricks along the way. My shots have really improved over the years, and I’d love to share a few tips with you guys.Ready to get started? Here’s a beginner’s guide to photographing the Northern Lights! Where and When Can I See Northern Lights?I traveled to Iceland (twice!) in order to see the phenomenon in person. Despite Iceland’s popularity as an aurora destination, it’s actually not the best place to witness them. You are more likely to see the lights in the northern areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada and Alaska.The best place to view the Northern Lights firsthand is a far-northern latitude within 65 degrees to 72 degrees, which is considered the “Northern Lights Zone”. The best time of year to travel to see the lights is in the winter months, November to March, due to low light pollution and clear atmospheric conditions! The Perfect WeatherWeather is a key component in photography, and the right conditions are essential for seeing the northern lights. If you’re going with a guide, he or she will be able to recommend the best times. If you’re going solo, you’ll have to know how to read the forecast.The most important thing is finding a night with the perfect level of cloud coverage.You’ll want a relatively clear night, devoid of clouds (clouds can block the lights if they’re really dense).The Icelandic Met Office website will show you the aurora forecast with a map of the cloud coverage, and it’s one of the best planning resources. It’s important to be away from any light pollution, so plan on getting out of the city.Generally speaking, your best chances of seeing the northern lights are during the autumn and winter months, so you’ll want to bundle up and pack a lot of patience– the lights are illusive.Reading the Northern Lights ForecastWhile ultra-useful, the aurora forecast isn’t the easiest thing to read. It’ll show a map of Iceland in whites and shades of green. The dark green areas are too cloudy while the white areas are too clear.The light green areas are ideal. Additionally, you’ll see a box on the top right of the page that shows a number from zero to nine. Anything over six means you’re more likely to see the northern lights.Spend some time experimenting with different times and locations until you figure out your best shot at seeing the phenomenon.The EquipmentCamera: Using a quality camera will make it infinitely easier to get the perfect shot. I’ve been using a Fujifilm X-T2 for a while now and I love it. While I was photographing the Northern Lights, the wind actually blew my tripod over and shattered my lens, but my ultra tough X-T2 took the fall like a champ.Its sturdy build is a huge perk for me while I’m traveling.Lenses: My personal favorite lenses to use for night photography are:FUJINON XF18-55mmF2.8-4.0 R LM OIS Zoom LensFUJINON XF10-24mmF4 R OIS Wide Angle Zoom LensAnything similar for your personal camera will work great!Extras: A shutter release cable is a great addition for shooting the lights, though a self-timer will also do the trick. It prevents the camera from shaking when you press down on the button, so you end up with a clear, in-focus photo. A bottle of wine or flask of whiskey are also recommended while waiting out in the cold 😉Check out My Travel Photography Gear for a full rundown of my equipment!Shooting the Northern LightsBundled up and ready to capture an amazing pic of the northern lights? Here’s what you’ll want to do:Helpful Tip: Every camera has different settings, so you’ll need to read up in advance on how to access the manual settings for your specific camera.Set up your tripod.Use your widest lens to capture the perfect view. Wide angle lenses work great — just be sure you have close to an f/2.8 max aperture.Turn your camera to full manual.Adjust your aperture to f/2.8. But make sure it is no higher than f/5.6.Set your ISO between 800-3200. You’ll have to adjust based on your camera and conditions.Set the focus. Infinity focus if you’re only shooting the sky, otherwise, you’ll want to focus on your subject.Set your camera to a 2 or 10-second timer or use a shutter release cable— you don’t want the camera shaking! The timer is also essential if you’re self-shooting and want to be in the shot.Leave the lens open for 10 or more seconds per shot. You’ll have to play around with the length of exposure depending on how strong the aurora is. Anything over 15 seconds will result in star movement.It’s easy to get caught up in trying to capture the moment but you really don’t want to miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see the northern lights with your own eyes. Practice shooting the night stars in advance to familiarize yourself with night photography.Then, when you finally see the lights, you can be relaxed and let your camera do the work while you enjoy the fantastic sight in front of you.Read More: The Beginner’s Guide to Photographing in Manual Mode Things to RememberSeeing the Northern Lights is not guaranteed– that’s the magic of nature! Don’t be disappointed if they don’t shine for you. I didn’t see them on my first trip to Iceland, but on my second trip, they outdid themselves!At times, the aurora can be hardly visible to the naked eye.Your camera will always capture a more vivid display of lights than you will see in person. If you catch a slight tinge of color in the sky, try setting up your camera. You might be surprised with what you capture!READ NEXT: The Best Photography Equipment for Travel Blogging Read MoreThe Best Photography Equipment for Travel BloggingMy Travel Photography Gear (Perfect for Female Travelers!)iPhone Photography Tips for Travel20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit IcelandHow to Survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a Camper VanDiving the Silfra Fissure in IcelandThe Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Iceland "
https://theblondeabroad.com/diving-the-silfra-fissure-in-iceland/,Diving the Silfra Fissure in Iceland,Iceland,"With seventy percent of the planet underwater, you’ve got to dive in to truly see what the world has to offer. Since getting scuba certified, I’ve been obsessed with traveling to the best dive sites around the world.The Silfra Fissure in Iceland is one of the most incredible dive sites you will ever see!I was so impressed with snorkeling the Silfra Fissure on my first trip to Iceland back in 2014 that I knew I had to get a bit deeper, especially after finishing my Advanced PADI certification in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico earlier this year.Here’s my experience diving the Silfra Fissure!The FissureThe Silfra Fissure is the space between the North American and Eurasian continental plates. This is actually the only place in the world where you can swim between two continental plates.It is incredible geographically, and its water is crystal clear. In fact, it’s some of the clearest water anywhere. The underwater visibility in the Silfra Fissure is well over 100 meters.That’s almost 330 feet!The water is so clear here because it’s filtered through underground lava for up to 100 years before it fills up the fissure. This stuff is seriously better than bottled water. What to ExpectSilfra Fissure isn’t for solo divers. You’ll need to book through one of the many companies that do diving excursions, and a guide will take you out. I did my dive with Arctic Adventures and loved it. These guys specialize in ecotourism and environmentally friendly trips all over Iceland.They have very knowledgeable and fun guides.The diving trips to Silfra Fissure last about 4-5 hours, including the pickup time. You can also meet the guides on location for a two-hour dive.When you book a Silfra Fissure dive with Arctic Adventures, and most companies for that matter, a certified PADI diveguide or divemaster will guide you around the Silfra Fissure and show you the most beautiful spots.The company provides all of the essential diving gear, including a special dry suit that is made for icy cold glacial water.You’ll stay relatively dry and mostly comfortable. Diving the Silfra FissureBefore you go to Silfra Fissure, it’s essential to be certified in diving. If you recently got certified, or just aren’t feeling confident in the water yet, this can be a tough dive. Your first time in a dry suit is a little intimidating too.Right after my trip in October 2016, new requirements to be able to dive in the National Park were set in places, and now divers must also be either dry suit certified or have proof of 10 logged dry suit dives (show their logbook or copy of their logged dives).These suits make everything feel different. The buoyancy when you are swimming in a dry suit in the Silfra Fissure is different from what you experience in the ocean in a wet suit.I’ll be honest that it’s a bit disorienting to dive in a dry suit. Even advanced divers might find it difficult to find their buoyancy.The good news is that this isn’t a deep dive, so a safety stop is not required. If you find yourself floating to the top, fear not! You can enjoy the view at any depth.The water in the Silfra Fissure is intensely cold.It’s nearly freezing (2 degrees Celsius / 35 degrees Fahrenheit to 4 degrees Celsius / 39 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the time of year). While the dry suits help, it’s honestly pretty uncomfortable.Don’t let that stop you though! Diving here is an awesome and exhilarating experience.Other Helpful TipsYou may get wet. My dry suit had a small leak in the foot, but I didn’t even notice I was wet until I took the dry suit off after my dive.When you are packing for the Silfra Fissure, forget about swimwear and cotton. Bring all things fleece and wool. Warm woolen socks are a must-have here. It’s also good to have a change of clothes just in case you do end up getting wet. Hand warmers aren’t a bad idea either!My hands got REALLY cold while under water. Before diving, the guides informed us that it’s best to keep your hands on your head out of the water or to not swim around with them. The movement pushes the warm water out of your neoprene gloves. If you’re planning on snapping photos, mentally prepare yourself!I took along my GoPro HERO7 Black and the 3-Way Mount on this dive for photos. However, if you plan on taking photos with your phone while diving, use protection. My LifeProof iPhone case was a serious lifesaver in Iceland between the snow, dirt and water we encountered in our adventures.More InformationTour: Deep Into the BlueCompany: Arctic AdventuresCost: Starting at 39,990 ISK (approx. $370 USD)"

This Scandinavian country is absolutely stunning and perfect for nature lovers and adventurers alike.On my first trip in 2014, I explored Reykjavik, drove the Golden Circle, and went glacier hiking and snorkeling the Silfra Fissure! My most recent trip last year took me all the way around the island, as I traveled the Ring Road in a camper van with Happy Campers.We explored the town of Vík and the southern coast, Mývatn and the northeast, the capital of the North, Akureyri– and then we followed the west coast down to Reykjavík. This time I chose to dive the Silfra Fissure along the Golden Circle!With a population of about 300,000 people, Iceland has the atmosphere of a small town everywhere you go. I could rave all day about Iceland—it’s natural wonders are truly something to behold—from massive glaciers and bubbling lava to picturesque fjords and waterfalls.Iceland is one of the safer destinations I have traveled solo, and that is why I highly recommend it to solo female travelers, and especially travelers taking their first solo trip!With friendly locals, stunning scenery and a lively tourism scene, you should experience Iceland at least once in your lifetime."
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-around-reykjavik-iceland/,Where to Find the Best Food Around Iceland,Iceland,"Our International Food Expert, Kate of We Travel We Eat, shares her favorite spots around Southern Iceland!Iceland’s appeal isn’t just in its glaciers and geysers. Sure, driving the captivating countryside is a huge part of the draw, but the food will exceed expectations just as quickly. The term fresh seafood takes on a whole new meaning in this small country, completely surrounded by isolated, Arctic waters.  Hardly a thing has to be done to make the high quality of its fish shine through. The easiest way to understand the landscape of the Icelandic countryside, and to figure out where you’ll eat along the way is to break it down into sections. The Ring Road wraps around the entirety of the country. Regionally, you can break it down to the North, the South, the Westfjords, the East, and then the Golden Circle right outside the charming city of Reykjavik. Within each of these areas, there are key places of interest to visit, making it easy to map out an itinerary.  Below focuses on the South, the famous Golden Circle, and Reykjavik!Kaffi HornidThe small fishing town of Hofn is known to some as the langoustine capital of the world. After a day of driving past bright blue icebergs and glaciers pouring out of mountains, you’ll need some food to somehow match the excitement of what you’ve just seen. Kaffi Hornid is no frills, but the food is on point.  Get the grilled lobster platter, served with garlic butter, salad and potatoes.  The lobster was some of the best I have ever had.Sudur VikLocated up on a hill in the very small but charming town of Vik, you’ll find the cozy Sudur Vik. Plates are simple, with Icelandic staples like pan-fried arctic char or fillet of lamb, both coupled with grilled rosemary potatoes and fresh salads.   Sveitagrill MiuSveitagrill Miu is a food truck. It is bright red, it’s on the side of a dirt road, and it has one picnic table in front of it to eat at if the weather happens to miraculously allow. It is also in Skogar, right around the corner from the EPIC Skogafoss Waterfall, and where you’ll want to eat while there.FridheimerFound within the depths of the expansive and gorgeous Golden Circle lies a glowing greenhouse that for me, was love at first site. Fridheimer is a glowing display of tomatoes and basil, and quickly gives off the sense of a place with a palpable passion for its trade. The entire family lives and works on the property, and will walk you through the history and the development of the small menu once seated. Get the bottomless tomato soup, grab some fresh bread, and marvel at the beautiful space.FiskmarkadurrinMy entry into the food scene in Reykjavik was a good one at the fish-centric two-story restaurant Fiskmarkadurrin. Opened for ten years now, the otherwise known Fish Market has become one of the staples of the growing food scene. The lights are hung low, the space is open, and the dishes are creative.  Coocoo’s NestRight off the water in the port area of Reykjavik, Coocoo’s Nest offers a cozy and creative reprieve when it’s time for lunch. Suspect as it may sound start with the beet bellini and follow it up with the blue cheese eggs Florentine; you will not be sorry.  Bergsson MathusSome of the best textured and most flavorful rye bread I’ve come across in a long time is born right here at Bergsson. Surround it with your choice of eggs, meats, cheeses and whatever fresh ingredients are on tap that day.  Seagreifinn“Sea Baron” is a very small, fisherman’s hole kind of place. Completely simple and equally authentic, gallons and gallons of piping hot lobster soup are churned out here every day. Grab your seat at one of the shared tables and enjoy.Matur og DrykkurMatur og Drykkur is a 10 out of 10. There are three tasting menus all with either five or eight courses; Icelandic (meat), seafood and vegetarian. Go with a hungry friend and get at least two of the eight-course options.  They are most famous for their whole cod’s head cooked in chicken dulce, but everything was memorable.  Efstidalur FarmEfstidalur Farm is home to a boutique hotel, cows, and some very good ice cream. An easy place to swing by on your way from the stops of the Golden Circle to Reykjavik, the ice cream here is made from the cows in the barn you look straight at as you order (don’t think about it). Go with the cinnamon, or the vanilla bean, and get it in the homemade waffle cone.  They’ll also ask you if you want the cone filled with their soft serve– say yes.Check out more of Kate’s foodie adventures here! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-survive-icelands-ring-road-in-a-camper-van/,How to Survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a Camper Van,Iceland,"Updated: January 2020Ready to get back to nature? There is no place better to enjoy the great outdoors than in Iceland. This Scandinavian country is absolutely stunning and perfect for nature lovers and adventurers alike.Iceland’s Ring Road, a.k.a. Route 1, circles the entire island and will show you the best of Iceland. Spanning 800 miles, this route is one of Europe’s top spots for road trips, and most people choose to explore via camper van.So, here’s how to survive Iceland’s Ring Road in a camper van! Your ItineraryThere’s no “right” way to drive the Ring Road. Do it at your own pace, and stop whenever for however long you choose!My advice is to map out your stops ahead of time (consider driving times, lighting for photos, and breaks for meals). Also, plan a rest day halfway through your trip. It made a huge difference. We recharged our batteries (literally) and took a break from schedules and driving.Know that you’ll have unplanned stops. A lot of them!There will always be fun surprises along the way, so avoid rushing through anywhere. We also cut out some of the bigger highlights of the trip (like the beach plane wreckage) because road conditions vary during different times of the year. If you have your heart set on seeing a particular area, be sure you can get there during the time you are visiting.Read More:The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road Itinerary Pick Out Your Camper VanSize matters! When we are talking about comfort and gas consumption, the size of your camper van is important, so you will want to give some real consideration to which camper you choose.On one hand, gas is expensive. Really expensive.If you do the math and translate the krona and liters into dollars and gallons, you’ll find fuel prices to be around 200 ISK per liter which is about $7.50 per gallon. While that’s obviously much higher than most of us are used to paying for transportation, it’s still a pretty good deal if you consider that you’ll have zero accommodation costs.We decided to go for the five-person van from Happy Campers because we were carrying a lot of photography gear in addition to our luggage. It was really spacious, and we never felt cramped at all, so we were really happy with our choice. Pack LightThe smaller your camper is, the less you will want to pack. Obviously, warm gear is essential, and you’ll want to have a good camera. Beyond that, less is more. If you can’t see yourself using it daily, you probably don’t need.Admittedly, I didn’t take my own advice. I brought it all but we had a big camper so it worked out. If you are going for a smaller camper, stick with the essentials so you aren’t crowding yourself out.Photographers, you will want to consider the amount of photography or video gear you plan to bring into the size of your camper van. If you’re debating on what to bring, at the very least, make sure you bring a tripod to capture the Northern Lights!Read More: What to Pack for a Week in Iceland Stay OrganizedIt is important to keep things packed and stored securely while you are driving. You don’t want luggage flying if you have to hit the brakes. Keep things packed away, and designate one small bag for essentials that you will always want to have handy. Prep Easy Meal PlansEven the most spacious camper won’t give you a ton of room for food prep, so keep it simple. Think grilled cheese sandwiches, eggs, pasta, and Food Doctor cups.Helpful  TipIceland has some of the cleanest water on earth. You can refill your water bottles at campsites so you’ll really just need to keep a few on hand.Pick Your CampsitesThe availability of campsites will depend on the time of year. Traveling in October, we found it to be hit or miss. The good news is that you can still camp at sites 365 days a year; you just won’t have access to facilities like toilets during the offseason.The best way to plan your stay is with a local map.You can get a campsite map from your camper van company, and you’ll definitely want to keep it handy. The majority of Icelandic campsites are well equipped. Nearly every campsite on the Ring Road has showers and toilets while a few have laundry units too. We even found one that had Wi-Fi and Jacuzzis! Buy Your Alcohol at Duty-FreeAlcohol is crazy expensive in Iceland. You can expect to pay $8 for a pint of beer if you go out. While I’d recommend checking out at least one Icelandic pub, your best bet is to have a well-stocked liquor cabinet.Plan to buy alcohol at the airport. You won’t pay tax at the duty-free store, so it’s far and away the best place to stock up. If you miss the duty-free, keep your eye for Vinbudin stores for the best deals on liquor!Read More: Tips for Traveling Iceland on a Budget Keep it CleanBaby wipes are essential, and you will want to bring your own towel. Most campers come with a brush but do a quick look inside to see what you have got and what you need so you can stock up on day one.Helpful  TipPack dryer sheets to tuck away and keep the van smelling fresh. We tracked a lot of water into the van each day from the rain, so they helped keep the van from smelling damp. SleepingIt gets COLD at night! You will want to have lots of blankets and a sleeping bag. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs or buy them at a pharmacy in Iceland.When you are ready to call it a day, park the van on level ground so you’ve got a flat surface to sleep on. We had a big enough van that we didn’t need to fold up the bed each day but you may need to convert your bed each evening and morning, so plan on needing extra time.Helpful  TipRoll your sleeping bag up with your blankets for easy unfolding later.Getting GasYour van may require diesel, so be SURE to confirm with your rental company. Unlike in the US, the diesel pumps in Iceland are black and regular gas pumps are green. Your rental company may give you a discount card on your keys. It is nice to have, but we found that the card only worked at two out of five gas stations we went to.Helpful  TipWhen you fill up, go inside to have an attendant turn on your pump, and then pay after filling up. International cards won’t always work outside, so it’s easier to just pay inside.Bring an InverterCharging cameras and gear means that you’ll need extra plugs. We rented an additional single outlet inverter from Happy Campers, which was very handy to have. This two-USB-post + two-outlet inverter worked perfectly for us. If you are bringing a lot of electronics, plan to bring two of them.Helpful  TipDon’t charge everything at once. We blew all three of the cigarette lighters in our car from charging too much. Fortunately, you can get replacement fuses at gas stations so it’s an easy fix.Stay ConnectedEven if you want to get away from it all, it’s still important to have Internet access for navigating. Get a Skyroam Wi-Fi hotspot or a local SIM card so you can find your way around and post your favorite shots of Iceland. I used a Skyroam hotspot on my whole trip and it worked perfectly.For a limited time, get an unlimited Skyroam subscription for $99/month!If you’re traveling in a group, Skyroam can connect up to 5 devices, so it’s a great investment to split it among your fellow adventurers.Read More: Why You Need to Travel with a Wi-Fi Hotspot NavigationIt’s important to get a physical map for your drive to cross-reference with your phone map. Sometimes it’s easier to look at the bigger picture on a map rather than just trusting your phone for turn-by-turn navigation.We actually used our physical map more than our phones because it was nice to see where we were headed. Download PlaylistsYou will be in your van for a LONG time, so create a ton of playlists before you go. It’s good to have different music for different moods, so download a bit of everything.Helpful  TipIf you’re using Spotify, be sure to download your favorite playlists to use in offline mode so you don’t need to use data to listen along! Take CautionRoad signs in Iceland are in Icelandic, so come prepared. It won’t take long to familiarize yourself with all of the common street signs, and it is worth every minute spent.It’s also incredibly important to be confident driving a manual transmission. You won’t find any automatic campers in Iceland, so be ready. You definitely don’t want to have to learn to drive a stick shift after you arrive. If you need to, practice at home before you go. It’s a really useful skill for international travel since automatic cars are few and far between.CAUTION: When you are on the road, expect sheep and serious WIND. While driving in Iceland is incredibly fun, it is not like your daily urban commute. Get Travel InsuranceThis is a personal decision but insurance is something that I recommend. Your camper is likely to see some damage. With the wind and gravel, it’s hard to keep a vehicle pristine.We had the wind blow our car door open and bend the frame. It was over 3,000 euros in damage and my World Nomads travel insurance policy covered it. World Nomads covers personal loss, theft, damages, and medical as well, so when I also had to see a doctor in Iceland, I was reimbursed for that visit!Read More: Ten Reasons to Get Travel Insurance for your Next Trip The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road ItineraryReady for the adventure of a lifetime?

https://theblondeabroad.com/flying-icelands-new-low-cost-airline-wow-air/,Flying Iceland’s New Low-Cost Airline: WOW air,Iceland,"***ALERT: As of March 2019, Wow Air is no longer operating flights.***(source)Flying as much as I do, I’ve been on my share of airlines and flights. I always like to know which airline has top-notch food, good entertainment, and comfy seats. Of course, we’re all looking for the best deals when it comes to airfare, so I jump at the chance to check out new airlines and see how they stack up.Check out my experience flying Iceland’s new low-cost airline, WOW air! Where WOW air FliesI recently flew from Los Angeles to Reykjavik, and on most airlines, it’s usually a really pricy flight with at least one layover. Typically, that means at least $800 and a minimum of twelve hours of travel. In fact, a lot of airlines have at least five-hour layovers that can make your journey more than twenty-four hours long. That’s a seriously long time to spend in transit.So, I was excited to see that WOW air has a direct flight from Los Angeles to Reykjavik.They’ve also got thirty-one destinations around Europe and North America– stateside, they operate out of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Boston, New York, and Miami (and Pittsburgh this summer).In Europe, they have extensive coverage in 15 destinations servicing Iceland including: Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Rome!WOW air’s Low-Cost FaresDepending on the time of year, WOW air has round-trip LAX-to-Reykjavik tickets for as low as $310 right now on their website. It is really NOT too good to be true. Of course, the prices fluctuate, so it’s important to be flexible with travel dates, but you can easily find great deals throughout the year to destinations all over the United States and Europe. Additional Fees—What’s the Catch?There’s no catch! Like all low-cost airlines, WOW air keeps airfare low and charges for add-ons. In other words, you get exactly what you pay for. If you want to take extra luggage, you pay for it. If you want snacks, you buy them.If you don’t want all the perks, you can grab dirt-cheap fares.Their prices are one hundred percent transparent when you are booking online. Check out all of their optional fees and charges to see exactly what you need. If you have a lot of luggage, the fees will add up quickly so it’s better to pack light. SeatingYou don’t need to pay to choose a seat, and you’ll have three different options. I opted for XXL legroom and it was totally worth it. Even with the add-on, my tickets were still cheaper than economy plus on most major airlines. WOW air Luggage FeesWhile you will pay an add-on charge for your luggage, it’s quite reasonable, and your total flight will still be less than most major airlines. For the lowest price, pay online before you go to the airport, and then weigh your bag at home to make sure that it’s not oversized.Here’s what luggage on flights over eight hours will cost:One Free Carry-On per GuestOversized Carry-On Upgrade for $38.99 (online) $48 (at check-in) Max: 56 x 45 x 25 cm/ 22 x 17.7 x 9.5 in. including wheels and handles Max: 12 kg/26 lbsOne Bag Max: 20 kg/44 lbs $48.99 (online) or $67 (at check-in) per flight legTwo Bags Max: 20 kg/44 lbs $97.98 (online) or $134 (at check-in) per flight legThree Bags Max: 20 kg/44 lbs $146.97 (online) or $201 (at check-in) per flight legOverweight charge: Per kilo/2.2 lbs is $19 per bag (max of 12 kg/26 lbs) Service OnboardWOW air has a good selection of meals you can order in-flight– I found their prices to be reasonable and you can get a great selection if you preorder online.Their in-flight menu includes snacks, drinks, deli treats, and Icelandic specialities like liqueur and chocolate. Their wine list is filled with high quality wines selected by Iceland’s top wine experts as well!I definitely recommend the cheese plate and the Food Doctor cups. WOW’s Stopover ProgramOne of the things I like most about WOW air is that they offer an a stopover program to their guests. If you are flying across the Atlantic, you can get a free stopover in Iceland.It’s like two trips in one!There is really so much to do and see in Iceland. Go horseback riding and whale watching. Do the Golden Circle tour to see all the incredible natural beauty of this remarkable country. Try authentic Icelandic cuisine at the Public House Gastropub, and then spend night at the fab Centerhotel Thingholt.Did you know that Iceland is famous for its chocolate? Be sure to go on a chocolate tour, and then, of course, see the world renowned Northern Lights.READ NEXT: How to Make the Most of an Iceland Stopover Read MoreWhat to Pack for a Week in IcelandTips for Traveling Iceland in the SpringWhy Your First Solo Trip Should Be to IcelandThe Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to IcelandThe Ultimate Guide to Moving to IcelandWhy NOW Is The Best Time for Americans to TravelHow to Avoid Overpacking for a TripThe Ultimate Travel Gear Packing GuideThank you to WOW Air for hosting me for a part of my stay in Iceland.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-moving-to-iceland-reykjavik/,The Ultimate Guide to Moving to Iceland,Iceland,"So you want to move to Iceland? Reykjavik is the city of Sigur Rós, breathtaking scenery, and an innovative tech and culture scene. It is also home to geothermal pools, long midsummer days, and little pollution.It’s the hip place at the moment, for tourists and expats alike, and every day more and more people are arriving to make Iceland their second home.But wait—before you go ahead and pack your bags, remember that life here is no fairytale. Prices are exorbitant, many jobs pay poorly, fresh produce is a distant memory and, for citizens outside the EU, immigration laws are strict.Here’s what you need to know before moving to Iceland!What to ExpectIceland has the benefit of being smack-dab in between the Americas and Europe, and you can see a lot of the influences from both sides. Icelanders love their burgers and the latest Apple gadgets but also their Nordic fashion. There’s a Dunkin’ Donuts right across the street from a creperie. So chances are, you’ll feel a bit at home already!The Kennitala: There’s a magical personal number called the kennitala- this is your ID number, similar to a social security number. Every registered resident of Iceland, temporary or permanent, has a kennitala, and you need one to do practically anything—open up a bank account, go to the doctor, borrow books from the library, etc.Climate: Iceland is up near the Arctic Circle, so this means long days in the summer and long nights in the winter. Summer is the best time to visit, as most shops and roads are open and the countryside is ripe for exploring–but winter can be cozy with the Northern Lights!In general, the weather changes dramatically day to day, and even hour to hour, giving rise to the local proverb: “If you don’t like the weather, just wait 5 minutes.”It generally doesn’t rise more than 65 degrees F even in summer, however—so be sure to pack a lot of hearty clothes and layers to keep yourself warm! A windbreaker is a must if you are venturing anywhere outside of the city.Read Next: Tips for Traveling Iceland in the SpringSafety: Iceland is incredibly safe. As a solo woman I often walked around the streets at night with no worry whatsoever. Pools: Each town in Iceland has a hot pool and downtown Reykjavik has three! The Icelandic swimming pool is unique in that it is heated with geothermal energy and most of them are outdoors. So you can enjoy a steam bath even when it’s snowing! Icelanders love to bring their families after work here to sit in the hot water and chat about latest politics.Language: If you don’t speak Icelandic—don’t worry! Almost everyone in Reykjavik speaks English and you can get by even if you’re monolingual. That being said, don’t be afraid to try your hand at Icelandic—it’s difficult, but a fun and beautiful language. You can sign up for classes at a language school or the University of Iceland.Cost of Living: Say goodbye to product diversity because Iceland, located in the cold North far away from nearly everything, has limited selection. Other than lamb, seafood and dairy, most things need to be imported and so fruits and vegetables can be scarce or sometimes poor quality. Naturally, this also means hefty prices. Electronics, furniture, alcohol, and restaurants are all going to be costly. There are also high taxes, foreign currency limits and crazy rental prices you should prepare yourself for. That said, the grocery tab is still fair—so you’ve got that going for you!Visas and ImmigrationThe standard tourist visa is valid for 90 days—so if your goal is a summer in Iceland, great. If you want to stay longer than 3 months, take note that it is very difficult to immigrate for US Citizens into Iceland. Ideally, you have dual citizenship—problem solved and no questions asked. Otherwise, you have to go through the lengthy process of either obtaining a work permit, applying for university studies, or getting cozy with a spouse from Iceland or the EU/EEA. Securing a job in Iceland is a challenge, as there are laws put in place that prioritize Iceland and EU citizens first. It helps if you have a specialized skill—if you’re a programmer or brain surgeon, great! You’ll have better luck than most. If not, your only hope is basically networking and personal connections, if you have any. Move to Iceland for a few months on a tourist visa and try to find a sponsor. If you’re lucky enough to score a job, you must get the company to sponsor your work permit and you must receive said permit without being in the country—that means the company has to be willing to wait for you no matter how many weeks it takes to process. The student visa is the easiest option, but it takes a while to set up. International applications to the University of Iceland close around February each year, so if you miss the cut off, you have to apply again next year! You find out if you’re in around March or April, then once you have your acceptance letter, you can apply with the Directorate of Immigration for your student permit. This permit requires a bunch of paperwork, including a bank statement and FBI background check, and it’s only valid for 6 months, so you have to apply again at each semester (unless you’re a Ph.D. candidate that is).How to Find AccommodationAccommodation is a challenge in Reykjavik! There’s a housing shortage and you are always going to compete with locals, students and other immigrants. Everyone wants to live in the 101 district (city center) where all the bars and top restaurants are—so if you’re one of them, expect to pay top dollar. Single rooms can price up as much as 80,000 ISK, if not more. Vesturbæjar, just west of the city center, is another somewhat trendy neighborhood. If price is a factor, opt for the nearby yet significantly less-cost neighborhoods like 105. The cost is not much regulated and landlords can charge whatever they want. Most importantly—if you see something—grab it! It will likely be gone within the day. In addition, landlords are turning their places into major profit through Airbnb, pushing locals out on the street. There have been some recent legislature set in motion to change this, but so far, that’s the situation.Getting AroundReykjavik is so small you can practically walk everywhere downtown. Of course, if you live in the suburbs—Garðabær or Kópavogur, for instance, pick up a bus pass or a bike. In the winter, bikes and bus traffic can slow down a lot, so do take that into account. If you want to travel anywhere else in Iceland, you have to have a car or a lot of patience to deal with the near-non-existent intercity buses. The short of it: if you’re living downtown, stick to walking!About the Expat CommunityThe good news is that there’s a thriving expat community! Young people from all over Europe, Asia and the Americas move to Iceland to live a laid-back lifestyle and earn the mullah. Yes, it’s expensive, and yes, the winters are cold, but any hearty expat can weather through. I highly recommend joining the handful of Facebook groups—here you can ask questions to veteran expats and find out the best hairdressers. The Facebook group called Away from Home – Living in Iceland is a good place to start!There are tons of concerts, organized meet-ups, and events like board game nights and poetry readings to keep you occupied.Other Helpful TipsCurrency: Give up your cash and checks—Icelanders only pay with card, even for the smallest things. The only thing that still takes cash officially is the bus.Grocery Shopping: Do all your shopping early—grocery stores close around 6pm or so, and everything closes up for the holidays or bad weather.Get Outdoors: Take advantage of the outdoors and the beautiful scenery while you’re here—there are several gorgeous hikes just 30 min from downtown, some easily accessible by bus.Weatherproof: Bring lots of weatherproof clothes, rain boots, a windbreaker, and layering options to protect you from the moody and unpredictable Icelandic weather. Of course you can buy these in Iceland, the quality is quite high—but so is the price. Read Next: What to Pack for a Week in Iceland"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-iceland-in-the-spring/,Tips for Traveling Iceland in the Spring,Iceland,"Spring is when Iceland thaws and wakes up from the hibernation of winter. People begin to venture out into the streets and take to the outdoors.  Days are getting longer; the earth is opening up with a few early blooms.Gone are the heavy winter storms and the dangerous icy roads—instead the temperature is about 40-50 degrees. This is the season to go if you are looking for green hill slopes, fishing, and golfing.Here are my tips for traveling Iceland in the Spring!Weather & Packing for IcelandEven though it’s spring, the weather in Iceland is predictably unpredictable. It can quickly go from rain to sun, from comfortable to chilly—so bring layers that you can easily jump in and out of. Bring a windbreaker, jacket, sweater, and long underwear or stockings no matter the forecast!Pick up a lopapeysa, a traditional Icelandic sweater, while you’re here. Pack a good pair of hiking or light trekking boots as most of Iceland’s attractions are in the rugged countryside where walking can be a challenge.Although counterintuitive to the weather trends, pack your swimsuit and a travel towel too—hot springs and hot pots are all the rage in Iceland!Read More: What to Pack for a Week in IcelandPhotography Tips for IcelandDon’t forget your camera (obviously)! Iceland’s landscape is famously dramatic and picturesque. A standard DSLR will do, but a tripod will help with moving subjects like waterfalls, puffins, and of course, capturing the Northern Lights.The light is magical in Iceland.It is always fluctuating and offers daylight as late as 10 o’clock in the spring. You’ll be able to catch a full range of celestial colors no matter what time of the day it is.Read More: My Travel Photography Gear (Perfect for Female Travelers!)Budget & Accommodation in IcelandMany hotels in Iceland are already filling up for spring, so book now! Reykjavik is more popular than ever; you’ll want to be sure you get your space among the crowds.But, there’s no getting around it, Iceland is expensive.There are ways to cut down a few costs, though. Hunt Airbnb or Flipkey for inexpensive flats, travel with other people on their road trip and keep your eating out to a minimum. Stick to the grocery stores and, if you have access to a kitchen, cook most of your meals!If budget isn’t an issue, Iceland has some amazing luxury and mid-range properties, including the ION Luxury Adventure Hotel, Reykjavik Residence Hotel, and the Kvosin Downtown Hotel.Read More: Tips for Traveling Iceland on a BudgetActivities in IcelandIn spring, Iceland begins to wake from its long winter sleep. The horses and sheep are set to graze, and it’s the perfect season to see the countryside atop a unique Icelandic horse.Hikers will be delighted—spring is the time when the snow starts to melt, and the major hikes and treks begin to open up. You can explore gorgeous mountains, shifting glaciers, and petite volcanoes deep in Thorsmork Valley and Landmannalaugar.Snowmobiling and glacier walking are still in full swing and have the added benefit of the occasional sunny skies. You can rent a four-wheeler and hit the highlands (which are usually inaccessible during the winter) and explore canyons and waterfalls off the beaten path.As the weather warms up, so does the tour season. Flying or ferrying to far-off places like Isafjordur, the Westman Isles, Videy Island, and Flatey Island is easy this time of year. You’ll have access to remote areas, emerald-green hillslopes, and secret seabird hangouts!Driving Iceland’s Golden Circle is an amazing experience with absolutely stunning scenery (and Icelandic horses!). The road can be explored in as little as a few hours- although I would recommend as long as possible!Not to be confused with the Iceland Ring Road, the route takes you through some of the most amazing sights in central Iceland, with scenery ranging from natural sites to historic buildings, and gives visitors the chance to experience the diversity of Iceland in a 300-kilometer loop.I drove a camper van along the Ring Road this past fall for seven days, and I was blown away by the beauty of the island and all the amazing stops along the way!The Silfra Fissure is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates and is located in Þingvellir National Park which is a short drive from Reykjavik. (Side note: Þingvellir is also one of the first stops along Iceland’s famous Golden Circle Road Trip!)It’s the only place in the world where you can dive or snorkel directly between two continental plates. So suit up in layers, and a dry suit, and jump on in!It’s safe to say that visiting the Blue Lagoon in Iceland is on just about everyone’s bucket list. It’s milky blue water and otherworldly appearance is like something out of a dream. While it is touristy, it is also an awesome experience and one I recommend to any traveler visiting Iceland for their first time!I recommend bringing your own towel and paying for the standard package (€35). You get your own locker and access to the Lagoon, saunas, and showers. I made the most of my visit and stayed for about 4 hours. But, make sure to avoid the Blue Lagoon Hair!I also want to mention that there are many different geothermal lagoons around Iceland– including ones that offer free entrance. It’s important to keep in mind that paying an entrance fee usually grants you access to lockers, showers, saunas and more, but if that’s not a priority to you, I’d recommend visiting Seljavallalaug, the oldest swimming pool in Iceland (pictured below), or Laugarvatn Fontana along the Golden Circle!April is the beginning of whale season in Iceland, so be sure to book a boat ride from Reykjavik or Husavik. Humpback whales, Minke whales, dolphins, porpoises, and orcas are common in the full bloom of spring.Spring in Reykjavik erupts with tech and arts events, including the Tectonics Reykjavik Musical Festival and the annual EVE Online Fanfest in April. The Vaka Folk Arts Festival in May brings together some of the top folk musicians, dancers, and crafts workers, and gives you the opportunity to witness the deep-rooted, traditional folk arts of Iceland!Don’t ForgetIf you intend to go on any road trips, be sure you bring a map or GPS– I’d recommend downloading an “offline” Google map just in case. Also, be sure to pack your sunglasses and sunblock; these items will be lifesavers, especially on the snowy glaciers where the sheer whiteness reflects the sun’s rays directly onto your skin.Though much of the time it’s still cold with sudden gusts of wind and overcast skies, there is the odd warm day of sunshine!Do you have any tips for visiting Iceland in the spring?"

Each season has its perks depending on what you want to see, do and experience!Iceland is the perfect destination for a first-time solo traveler to a family looking to road trip around the island. With friendly locals, stunning scenery and a lively tourism scene, you should experience Iceland at least once in your lifetime.Here is the rundown on the best time to go to Iceland!April to MayIn April, Iceland is deep into spring, and the snow blizzards partway to rain, wind, and the occasional sunny day. Days are getting longer, the earth is opening up with a few early blooms.Gone are the heavy winter storms and the dangerously icy roads—instead the temperature is about 40-50 degrees. This is the season to go if you are looking for green hill slopes, fishing, and golfing.Festivals: Aldrei for eg sudur Rock Music Festival in Isafjordur & Design March  June to AugustIn June, spring gives way to summer, the best season in terms of fine weather. Temperatures can range from 50-60 degrees and the grass is lush and vibrantly green. Horses and sheep freely roam the countryside. In the summer, the midnight sun reaches its peak giving 24 hours of daylight.On the rare hot day, Icelanders run around in shorts and fire up the barbecue. Iceland, in general, is more accessible during this time; shops are open later and roads in the highlands are reachable.This is the height of the tourist season, however, so expect crowds, overbooked hotels, and higher prices.Summer Highlights: Thjodhatid in Westman Isles & Culture Night in ReykjavikSeptember to NovemberOctober heralds the beginning of the Northern Lights season. As cooler temperatures begin to draw closer, people huddle in the cinemas and cafes.The cities are about with film, art, and music festivals during this time—including the world-famous Iceland Airwaves.

Tours book up for the Northern Lights, glacier hiking, and other exciting snow activities.Some roads will be closed during this time, and it’s not uncommon to hear a nationwide storm alert on the radio. If you’re looking to drive around the island in remote areas, it is best to avoid this season—most people stay indoors to avoid the weather.Christmas time is a magical week abound with lights, candles, mulled wine, trees, and special Christmas beers brewed just for the holiday.Winter Highlights: Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival "
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-care-for-your-hair-at-the-blue-lagoon/,How to Protect and Treat “Blue Lagoon” Hair,Iceland,"For travelers visiting Iceland, the Blue Lagoon is high on almost everyone’s bucket list. It’s warm, milky blue water and otherworldly appearance is like something out of a dream. On my last trip to Iceland, I took the day to relax and play around in the lagoon, and it was magical!While the silica and sulphur in the water of the Blue Lagoon are amazing for your skin, beware. The geothermal water can have negative effects on hair, especially for women!As a blonde, water is my hair’s worst enemy. I’ve definitely had issues with everything from green hair problems after a swim in a pool to breakage from too much ocean water, so I was worried.The geothermal water at Blue Lagoon has high levels of silica, and while silica is not harmful to hair (I repeat, NOT harmful to hair — don’t panic!), it can become stiff and difficult to manage once wet. You will feel the mineral buildup and you will need to treat it.I’ve gotten asked quite a few times, how the heck to avoid this issue, so I’ve put together some of the tips that worked best for me.Here’s how to protect and treat Blue Lagoon hair!Before You Go: Pack a Clarifying Shampoo and Conditioner: To prevent that mineral buildup, pack a clarifying shampoo and a deep-conditioner that doesn’t contain protein. After swimming in the Blue Lagoon, you’ll need to clarify the mineral buildup from your hair then recondition it.1. Rinse Your Hair Before EnteringIf you rinse your hair with mineral water before entering the geothermal water, your hair will absorb less silica, resulting in less of that feeling of mineral buildup!2. Apply Conditioner BEFORE Getting in the WaterLather up your hair in your deep conditioner, and leave it in while you bathe! (Remember, you want a deep conditioner that doesn’t contain protein — just pure moisture!) The Lagoon also offers complimentary conditioner in the shower area if needed.3. Splash AroundMany girls had their hair up in buns and swim caps, but I was adamant on getting an epic shot in the Lagoon, so I went all in. Don’t be afraid!4. Wash Your HairWhen you get out of the water, immediately wash your hair with your clarifying shampoo 2-3 times. There’s also complimentary shampoo in the shower areas if needed.5. RinseRinse thoroughly then towel blot out some of the water and put your deep conditioner on the mids and ends of your hair.6. Deep Condition OvernightIf you need to rinse your hair out before you leave the spa, let the conditioner really soak in, and don’t rinse until you’re ready to leave. Then, do an overnight deep condition when you’re able. Repeat the shampooing and conditioning process the next day if you still feel buildup.After washing with a clarifying shampoo and an overnight deep condition, my hair was 100% back to normal!I hope these tips help you enjoy your trip to the Blue Lagoon in Iceland!

https://theblondeabroad.com/solo-female-travelers-guide-to-iceland/,The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Iceland,Iceland,"With only 300,000 people, Iceland has the atmosphere of a small town everywhere you go. I could rave all day about Iceland—it’s natural wonders are truly something to behold—from massive glaciers and bubbling lava to picturesque fjords and waterfalls.Iceland is one of the safer destinations I have traveled solo, and that is why I highly recommend it to solo female travelers, and especially travelers taking their first solo trip!Here’s my solo female traveler’s guide to Iceland!Where to StayIf you’re looking for some top-notch hotels in Reykjavik, make sure to check out the downtown area- the closer you are to the main street ‘Laugavegur’, the better!For more budget-conscious travelers, reasonable accommodation is not that far away either—try Airbnb or budget hostels in the residential areas just south of Laugavegur, or west in the Vesturbaer district.Once out of the city, accommodation becomes a lot more scarce. You may find some hostels, inns and farmhouses online, but be sure to book in advance—Iceland is enjoying a tourist boom right now and it’s not uncommon for beds to be booked up!Read More: Tips for Traveling Iceland on a BudgetWhat to SeeIceland has so many things to do and see, so it is east to fill up a 3 day, 5 day or week-long itinerary! If you have some time, my biggest recommendation would be to drive Iceland’s Golden Circle so you can see the diversity of sights Iceland has to offer.Iceland is a land of fire and ice—and it’s the natural sights that will leave you breathless. Renting a car is the easiest and most efficient way to explore outside of the city, so if you are able to, do it!If you have a week or longer, I HIGHLY recommend renting a camper van and driving the Ring Road all around the island.There are amazing sights to be seen!Check out the Lake Myvatn and the bubbling mud pits in the north, or the stunning waterfalls and glacier lagoon of the south. Another beautiful area to explore is the West Fjords, in the northernmost part of the country—green valleys and snow-capped peaks make this a truly beautiful region.Some other highlights include horseback riding, glacier hiking, snorkeling the Silfra Fissure, and swimming in Iceland’s natural geothermal hot springs. If you don’t have a car, it’s fairly easy to book a day trip from Reykjavik.Read Next: The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road ItineraryFood in IcelandFor centuries, Icelandic food was based on a diet of meat, dairy and fermented goods. If you’re brave, you should try local delicacies like rotten shark, sour milk, sheep head and testicles. In Reykjavik, there are plenty of top-notch, tasty restaurants—just be aware that these come at a price! To save on the bucks, shop at grocery stores and prepare food in your accommodation’s kitchen, if one is available.Before you go, be sure to try a traditional Icelandic hot dog—Iceland’s answer to fast food. A special blend of lamb, pork and beef, the Icelandic version is served with remoulade, fried onions and brown sauce.Read Next: Eating Rotten Shark in IcelandGetting Around IcelandRoads in Iceland tend to be a bit underdeveloped in places, and most people rely on cars to get from A to B. Public transportation is solely dominated by intercity or long-distance buses.Reykjavik downtown is fairly small, easily navigable on foot or by bus.When you arrive at Keflavik International Airport, approximately 45 minutes away from Reykjavik, the simplest way to the city center is the Flybus. For an extra cost you can get them to drive you directly to your hotel!What to PackBesides the general food and camera, be sure to pack a map and a GPS. Although you can’t really get lost on the Ring Road around Iceland—it’s the country’s only highway, after all—maps can reveal distances, road quality, and where to find the next gas station.Be sure pack warm clothes— windproof jackets, fleece sweaters, hiking boots, wool socks, thermal pants, beanie and gloves— regardless if you’re traveling in the summer or winter, as the weather notoriously changes rapidly and often!Read More: What to Pack for a Week in IcelandWhen To GoThe best time to go, weather-wise, is during the summer months. The days are long and temperatures are relatively warm.Shops and museums are open longer than in winter, and there are more festivals than during the rest of the year. Rain and wind is still common in Iceland so be sure to bring your outdoor gear.If you want to avoid the crowds, try the cusp months— September, October, April or May— though it will be much colder and darker. Iceland in winter can be quite beautiful, however, coated in ice!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-driving-icelands-golden-circle/,The Ultimate Guide to Driving Iceland’s Golden Circle,Iceland,"Iceland is a country that is becoming an increasingly popular destination for people who are looking for different and diverse experiences. Whether you have a stopover in Iceland on a flight from North America to Europe or are planning to spend two weeks in Iceland, there is certainly no shortage of attractions and interesting experiences that you can enjoy.If you don’t have 10 days to drive the Ring Road around the island, driving the Golden Circle route out of Reykjavik is an amazing experience, and can be explored in as little as a few hours- although I would recommend as long as possible!Here’s my guide to driving Iceland’s Golden Circle in a day!What is the Golden Circle?Not to be confused with the Ring Road in Iceland, which takes about a week to explore and complete, the Golden Circle is a circular route that covers about 300 kilometers and loops from Reykjavík into central Iceland and back in a day trip.The route takes you through some of the most amazing sights in central Iceland, with scenery ranging from natural sites to historic buildings, and gives visitors the chance to experience the diversity of Iceland in a relatively short trip.While it is the natural points of interest that tend to get the most attention, there are so many breathtaking points along the route, including Icelandic horses!You can join organized tour groups, but driving the Golden Circle yourself allows you to stop anytime you want or even take a little detour off the beaten path.Believe me, you will want to make a million stops, so give yourself enough time to enjoy it all!Renting a Vehicle in IcelandWhen it comes to renting a car in Iceland, it can often be quite an expensive experience, so here are some tips that you can use to reduce your costs:You can pre-book your rental online to get the best deal. My friend Matt and I decided to go the rental car route and used the company, SadCars.For those of you that require a car with automatic transmission (like me!) be sure to book well in advance because there’s a limited supply in Iceland. SadCars had a sturdy, automatic 4×4 so I was able to take turns driving.Gas is also expensive, currently over $7 USD per gallon, so make sure you factor this cost into your Iceland budget too and start with a full tank!If you are flexible with travel dates, the low season between September and May will bring down the rental costs.The Golden Circle route is paved with plenty of signs, so four-wheel drive is not always needed for the main route, but rental car companies will be able to provide any information or equipment that you might need!Read More: 10 Tips for Your First Trip to IcelandNavigation & TimingThe most challenging part of navigating the Golden Circle route is actually getting out of Reykjavik, which is by far the busiest part of this route.Once you are outside the city, nature surrounds you and, by driving the route yourself, you can stop to enjoy the drive almost anywhere you like.Scrolling over the map will allow you to zoom in, and clicking More Options will take you to a stop by stop itinerary!﻿The main sights around the Golden Circle are posted well, but most car rental companies will give you the option of renting a GPS unit too.Helpful  TipYou can download your route with Google Maps on your smartphone to use offline, you can save some money by skipping the GPS.Without stopping, the Golden Circle route can take as little as 3.5 hours to drive, but we spent about 8 hours on the road capturing a lot of photos and didn’t feel too rushed.Keep in mind that timing is completely up to you while driving the Golden Circle!Where to Stop Along the Golden CircleWhile there are countless stopping points along the Golden Circle, here are a few of the most popular destinations that we chose to stop at along our drive!Thingvellir National ParkThingvellir National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and has played a major part in Iceland’s history. You can find lakes, waterfalls, natural formations, and most exciting to me, the Silfra Fissure!The Silfra Fissure is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates, and it’s the only place in the world where you can dive or snorkel directly between two continental plates. Since I got my PADI Open Water Diver certification in Bocas del Toro, this was on the top of my list!Read More: Snorkeling the Silfra Fissure in IcelandDiving the Silfra Fissure in IcelandStrokkur GeyserLocated in the Haukadalur Valley, Strokkur is one of two large geysers in the area, and the only one that is currently active.Strokkur is also one of the most reliable geysers in the world, sending plumes of steam and very hot water high into the air, erupting every eight to ten minutes.Gullfoss WaterfallThe dramatic Gullfoss waterfall of the Hvita river crashing over the cliffs into a relatively narrow crevice is one of the most popular spots in Iceland for tourists. From some angles, you can’t even see where the water disappears, and can only see the plume of spray rising into the air.Kerid Crater LakeKerid crater lake is a stunning crater made up of red rocks alternating with streaks of green grass and moss, which contrasts with the deep blue color of the lake itself.It is an interesting place to stop, with a short hike to the waterfront, and where you can see the remains of the collapsed volcano.Other Interesting Stops Along the Golden CircleLaugarvatn Fontana – A Spa & Wellness center built on natural hot springs. You can enjoy steam baths, geothermal pools & more!Skálholt Cathedral – Following Iceland’s adoption of Catholicism, Skálholt became home to the country’s largest cathedral. It is a spectacular structure!Hveragerði – Home to hot springs and a geothermal park, shopping, and numerous nature adventures you can enjoy on a long pit stop!The Geothermal Energy Exhibition – This energy plant is owned by Reykjavík Energy and shows how geothermal energy is harnessed in a sustainable manner and experienced guides are on-hand to provide informative presentations.WeatherThe weather in Iceland can be seriously unpredictable. You can go from a complete snowy white-out to blue skies in just one hour along the drive. We went in the middle of October and experienced all four seasons in a day- nearly every day!Make sure to check weather and road conditions ahead of time, and you can use this site to do so!Read More: The Best Time to Travel to Iceland"

The free stopover is proving to be very popular among travelers, because Iceland is in the natural air route between North America and Europe, and the offer gives you the opportunity to spend a few extra days in this attractive destination.Even if you aren’t flying with Iceland Air, check your flight itinerary and see if you could fit in a few extra days on this stunning island too!Here are my tips on how to make the most of an Iceland stopover!Booking a Stopover with Iceland AirThe promotion offered by Iceland Air offers travelers a stay in Iceland for up to seven days and split the journey from North America to Europe (or vice versa) without paying any additional fares.This effectively gives you two vacations for the price of one!With the incredible range of things available to do in Iceland, this is definitely a second vacation that is worth including in your journey. Not to mention the flexibility of being able to take your stopover either on the outbound flight or on the return journey!Read More: The Ultimate Iceland Travel GuideHow to Spend 1-2 Days in IcelandIf you are on a tight travel schedule and don’t have time to really go exploring across the country, even a weekend stopover can be made into a very special experience. You can head to the capital Reykjavik and have an awesome cultural experience.Make time to sample some of Reykjavik’s local eats, like a hot dog from Baejarins beztu pylsur, locally caught fish (at pretty much any restaurant), and, for the brave, fermented shark- a food even Bizaar Food’s host, Andrew Zimmerman could barely stomach!Read More: Where to Find the Best Food Around IcelandA short distance from the airport is the Blue Lagoon, a large, naturally-heated thermal pool, that is one of the most popular attractions in Iceland. My best advice for a short stopover is to use the Blue Lagoon’s hourly bus service to visit on your way to or from the airport. There are lockers so you can easily bring and store your luggage!If you are looking for a more active addition to your trip, definitely consider booking a tour like snorkeling the Silfra fissure, the crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates, or going glacier hiking or ice climbing!Read More: Tips for Visiting Iceland’s Blue LagoonHow To Spend 3-4 Days In IcelandThose who have a little more time to spend in Iceland will find even more to do, and renting a car is the way to go! Hit the road and drive the Golden Circle route which offers an amazing introduction to the natural sites around the country.The Golden Circle can easily be driven in a day, but there are also tours that you can take if you don’t want to rent a car.The scenery of the Golden Circle is breathtaking- with waterfalls, volcanos, and geysers galore!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Driving Iceland&#8217;s Golden CircleAs you drive around the country, you will see plenty of Icelandic horses which live both on farms and wild along the road. While many are cautious of people, some of these beautiful animals will allow you to pat or even hug them.I mean, aren’t the horses reason enough to visit?! So cute!Spending more time in Iceland will also allow you to see more of the capital! The nightlife in Reykjavik is world famous and you can also climb the tower at Hallgrimskirkja which offers an amazing view across the city.You’ll definitely want to book at least one if not two tours if you’re short on time, and I highly suggest Arctic Adventures. I went Ice Climbing, snorkeling and scuba diving in the Silfra Fissure, but they offer all sorts of tours, from whale watching to river rafting (depending on the time of year).Read More: Diving the Silfra Fissure in IcelandHow to Spend a Week in IcelandWith a week in Iceland, you can conquer all of these activities and more! Depending on road conditions and season of travel, consider renting a car or a camper van for the best way to explore more of the island.If you are visiting Iceland during the summer (or anytime road conditions are ok), one of the best things you can do is to take the road trip around the Ring Road, which explores much of the exterior of the country, and takes in a great range of sights.The Ring Road typically requires a minimum of 7 days to fully appreciate, but you could do it quicker.Read More: The Ultimate Iceland Ring Road ItineraryTips for Driving Iceland’s Ring RoadIceland is also famous for being a great place to see the Northern Lights, so heading out of the towns and cities at night to see if you can spot this elusive phenomenon can make for a memorable layover.The Ion Hotel is a great hotel for a luxurious stay outside of town with great opportunities of viewing the Northern Lights!Read More: The Beginner’s Guide to Photographing the Northern LightsDo you have any travel tips for Iceland?

When I announced that I was traveling Iceland, I complied a list of the top 10 reasons to go to Iceland– which was basically a list of my dream experiences that I hoped to have while visiting.I normally wouldn’t put a hotel on my list of “Top Things to Do” in a destination, but the Ion hotel is more than a hotel, it’s an experience.The Ion Hotel in Iceland is located about an hour outside of Reykjavik and is an eco-friendly hotel that has received a myriad of awards for both design and sustainability.Anyone else think it looks like an AT-AT Walker from Star Wars?The HotelUpon arriving, I immediately understood the hype behind the Ion Hotel. The scenery demanded attention. An industrial and modern designed hotel played off the harsh, other-worldly surroundings.The hotel had a one-of-a-kind “Icelandic-ness” about it.Ion is surrounded by hot springs, which provide geothermal hot water and energy to the hotel and it’s natural hot pool. Lava, reused wood, Icelandic wool and other natural materials are used extensively in furniture throughout the hotel.RoomsAfter checking in, a short hallway led down the hotel and to the room. While minimalistic, the room was cozy and warm. The beds were fitted with fair-trade organic linens and hypoallergenic beds.Geothermal water pumped through environmentally friendly showers and all of the soaps and lotions, by Sóley Organics, were made from locally-sourced, organic ingredients.Even a standard room at Ion offers an incredible view across the lava fields towards Thingvellir National Park. There was also a delicious plate of treats waiting for me in the room.Someone must have heard macarons are the way to this girl’s heart…Amenities & ActivitiesIon not only features a luxury spa, pool and sauna, but also offers countless tours around the Thingvellir National Park area from hiking to ice climbing.Sauna10m long, warm, outdoor poolLuxury SpaSilent Relaxation RoomHorseback riding, fishing, kayaking, super jeep safaris, rafting, glacier tours, hot springs, hiking, snorkeling and divingAnd last but not least, Ion offers the ultimate opportunity for viewing the Northern LightsI was so busy with adventures around Iceland that I didn’t have too much time to relax at the hotel.But, you can bet I ran straight for that pool as soon as I set down my bags!DiningIon’s Silfra Restaurant and Northern Lights Bar menus feature fresh local ingredients as well as beers, liqueurs and spirits from Iceland’s many microbreweries.I took a stroll through the Northern Lights Bar before sunset and was blown away by the beautiful, bright and open design.My stay at Ion wouldn’t have been complete without having dinner at Silfra Restaurant. Modern Icelandic and Nordic cuisine is created by master chef, Ágúst Már Garðarsson. Everything from the local wine, to the fresh caught fish was outstanding.As a food-obsessed traveler, I’m always on the lookout for the best dining experiences around the world and Silfra did not disappoint. Fresh bread and a cup of soup came as a first course- simple comforts with the cold Icelandic weather. I ordered cod with vanilla and lime for my main and was impressed with the portion size and complexity of flavor.After an incredible meal, I was too full for dessert, but I would literally return to Ion just to try their Skyr brûlée.In My OpinionWhile the Northern Lights didn’t shine through the cloud cover during my stay, my time at Ion was no less memorable. For anyone traveling to Iceland looking for a luxurious and truly Icelandic experience, don’t miss the Ion Luxury Adventure Hotel!More InformationHotel: Ion Luxury Adventure HotelLocation: Selfoss, IcelandAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$Special thanks to Ion Hotel for hosting me as their guest. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own.Want to earn points for your hotel stays and earn miles toward your next adventure?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/renting-apartment-reykjavik-flipkey/,Renting an Apartment in Reykjavik with FlipKey,Iceland,"There are different types of accommodation for every type of traveler, but I have to admit apartment rentals have become my favorite. There’s something special about traveling abroad while having all the comforts of home.Even if it isn’t exactly your home.While traveling in Iceland with fellow travel blogger Matt, of Expert Vagabond, we partnered with FlipKey to share our experience of staying in a local’s apartment in Reykjavik.We browsed the FlipKey website for an apartment that would fit our needs. When searching for the perfect apartment in Reykjavik, we considered a few options: Location: I wanted to be within walking distance of the city centerSize: We needed two bedroomsAmenities: Washing machine and fast WiFi were essentials for me- bathtub was a huge bonus!Parking: We were renting a car, so this was another essentialMatt and I ended up finding the perfect apartment on FlipKey that met all of our needs and was available for the duration of our trip in Reykjavik.I absolutely fell in LOVE with this apartment!You really couldn’t beat the location. We were in a cute little neighborhood that was about a 10 minute walk from the city center of Reykjavik.After a full day of exploring Iceland, I cannot express how nice it was for us to return “home” to a warm and cozy apartment and kick our feet up on the couch. It felt like our own space and made our stay in Iceland so much more comfortable.My bedroomMatt’s bedroomThe outdoor patioWe stocked the fridge and would cook a homemade breakfast with a nice big pot of coffee every morning before hitting the road. We definitely saved money on our trip by being able to cook one of our meals on our own, which is one of the nice things about apartment rentals. I was also completely swooning over the kitchen in this apartment too. Isn’t it cute??I’m not a huge cold weather person, so I took full advantage of a hot bubble bath each evening. Because of the geothermal water in Iceland, it was like having my own sulfur bath each night right in my own apartment. While sulfur doesn’t smell so nice, it’s SO good for your skin.Interesting Fact: Iceland obtains 100% of its electricity and about 85% of its heat from domestic renewable energy sources.Cool, right?I highly recommend renting an apartment in Reykjavik with FlipKey. It could easily have accommodated 2 couples (or 4 travelers) comfortably. Split between a group, an apartment is an even less expensive option than a hostel.Plus you get all the comforts of home!Location: Reykjavik, IcelandAccommodation: ApartmentPrice Range: $183/nightUPDATE: In response to some concerns regarding the legality of renting an apartment in Reykjavik, FlipKey requires owners to represent that they can legally rent out their home to travelers in the terms and conditions that owners agree to prior to registering on FlipKey.Special thanks to FlipKey for hosting me as their guest. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/snorkeling-silfra-fissure-iceland/,Snorkeling the Silfra Fissure in Iceland,Iceland,"Since getting my PADI Open Water Diver certification in Bocas del Toro, I’ve been on the lookout for epic dive sites and underwater adventures around the world.The Silfra Fissure is one of the most incredible dive destinations on earth, so it was an absolute MUST when I went to Iceland.Interesting Facts about the Silfra FissureThe Silfra fissure is a crack between the North American and Eurasian continental plates.It’s the only place in the world where you can dive or snorkel directly between two continental plates.The underwater visibility in the Silfra fissure is over 100 meters, making it some of the clearest water on the planet.The water is filtered through porous underground lava for 30-100 years until it reaches the north end of Thingvellir lake, seeping out from underground wells and through the fissure. The filtration process is what makes the water super clear as well as drinkable!The water is nearly freezing (2°C / 35°F – 4°C / 39°F year round ) as it is glacial water from the Langjökull ice cap.While traveling through Iceland with my friend and fellow travel blogger Matt, of Expert Vagabond, we partnered up with Arctic Adventures to see and do some of the best things in Iceland.Less than 24 hours after arriving in Iceland, I was hitting the road with Arctic Adventures for their Black and Blue Caving and Snorkel tour to go snorkeling in the Silfra Fissure and caving in a lava tube!The Silfra Fissure is located in Þingvellir National Park which is a short drive from Reykjavik. (Side note: Þingvellir is also one of the first stops along Iceland’s famous Golden Circle Road Trip!)Since the water is just a few degrees above freezing, we suited up in dry suits. First, we put on fuzzy warm body suits, not dissimilar to one piece pajamas. We put on the actual dry suit and made sure our wrists were sealed tight.The dry suits would make everything other than our hands and heads completely water-proof.Our hands were outfitted with thick neoprene gloves and we slipped thick hoodies over our heads. While our hands and heads would get wet, the neoprene would trap the water and our own body heat would warm the water, keeping us from getting too cold.The last essentials were flippers and a snorkel mask and then it was into the fissure!I felt like an astronaut entering a new planet as I slowly dipped into the water. The suit ensured I would float right on the surface and the current gently drifted me down the fissure.Entering the Silfra FissureI put my face into the water and was instantly shocked by the incredible cold! Though, just as I was told, I couldn’t feel a thing after a few minutes.Matt and I were able to snap lots of photos thanks to our water-proof and freeze-proof LifeProof iPhone cases but, my hands did get unbearably cold halfway through the dive, so I have to thank him for most of the Silfra photos! “Thanks Matt!”When we got out of the freezing cold water I realized my body stayed (mostly) dry but, my cold wet hair left me shivering. Luckily, we were greeted with a big cup of hot cocoa.It was the perfect pick me up!Next, we boarded the Arctic Adventures van for our next adventure: the “black” part of our tour. I’d been caving before but never in an underground lava tube, so I had no idea what to expect.The Þingvellir National Park is scattered with interesting lava caves and we would be going inside one. It was a short drive from Silfra to the caves but, when we stopped, it felt like we were in the middle of nowhere.We put on helmets and headlamps and followed our guide to the opening of a very inconspicuous lava tube entrance.The entrance to cave was created by a lava tube collapsing. And the tube was created by flowing lava that hardened and turned into a sort of underground tunnel.We walked in one end and over volcanic rock in complete darkness (only lit by our headlamps) until we reached the other end. Different colors in the rock lit up from our headlamps.It was like entering another world!The tiny exit from the caveI had such an amazing day with Arctic Adventures and highly recommend their Black and Blue tour. It was very cool to experience two elements of Iceland, Earth & Water, in a single day!Helpful TipsThough the website says you’ll do black before blue, we went snorkeling first.You may get wet. My dry suit had a small leak in the foot, but I didn’t even notice I was wet until I took the dry suit off after my dive.My hands got REALLY cold while under water. Before diving, the guides informed us that it’s best to keep your hands on your head out of the water or to not swim around with them. The movement pushes the warm water out of your neoprene gloves. If you’re planning on snapping photos, mentally prepare yourself!Bring an extra change of clothes, just in case. Extra warm socks are good idea. Hand warmers aren’t a bad idea either! More InformationTour: Black and BlueCompany: Arctic AdventuresCost: From 22.990 ISK per person (approx. $220 USD) I returned to Iceland 2 years later and chose to scuba dive in the Silfra Fissure.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ice-climbing-iceland/,Glacier Hiking and Ice Climbing in Iceland,Iceland,"I was traveling through Iceland with fellow travel blogger Matt, of Expert Vagabond, and I was both thrilled and a little nervous about us partnering with Arctic Adventures, a local Icelandic adventure tour company.Thrilled, because I would be exploring some of the best things to do in Iceland.And nervous, because I am terrified of heights. And cold water. And small spaces. And the dark.Yes, I’m a total scaredy cat. I’ll be the first to admit it. I can’t help the things that make my heart pound a little bit faster, but I’ve done my best to conquer my fears as I travel.That’s why I hurled myself out of a plane at 12,000 feet in New Zealand, despite wanting to throw up all over my tandem skydive buddy. And why I got my PADI diver certification, despite being scared to death of the deep ocean.Matt and I would be joining Arctic Adventures on their Blue Ice Glacier Tour for a full day of icy exploration. We joined our group in the city center of Reykjavik and began our drive out to the Sólheimajökull (say that 5 times fast) glacier.It took about 2 hours to arrive at the glacier. The weather was typically Icelandic (aka unpredictable) when we arrived in a downpour of rain. Regardless of the weather, the adventure goes on!This was my first time doing anything that required ice axes and crampons and I have to admit I was a little intimidated by all the metal and spikes. All I could think was, “what did I get myself into?!“We suited up in our gear and began glacier hiking and ice climbing adventure in Iceland!Walking to the glacierEven the walk to the glacier was awesome!Gearing upPutting on my crampons (they’re basically spikes for your shoes so you can grip the ice better)Since the glacier is a “crawling” glacier, it is constantly moving. It grows and shrinks every day changing the ice formation. If you were to visit in the Winter and come back in the Spring, it might look completely different.That kinda blew my mind.I always pictured glaciers as big old blocks of ice floating in the middle of the ocean. But, Sólheimajökull is a glacial tongue that is rugged and riddled with ice caves, ridges and sink holes.We arrived at the glacier and were guided through safe areas of the glacier that we could trek. Blue ice and black volcanic rock appeared like a painting of colors upon the glacier.Once we had passed massive cracks, holes and glacial waterfalls, we came to the ice wall that we were going to climb. And that’s when the fear set in.I didn’t want anyone to know how scared I truly was, so I offered to be one of the first to go. I was given ice climbing axes and harnessed to a line that was anchored at the top of the wall. One of the guides would be holding the other end of the line and adjusting the slack so I wouldn’t fall.The ice wall I was about to climbThere was no real danger and, even if I fell off the wall, I was tightly harnessed and would have merely hung like a Christmas ornament. Going up wasn’t the scary part. It’s always the down part I have a hard time wrapping my head around.I kicked my crampons into the ice wall and slammed my ice axes in until they felt strong enough to hold, and then I began my ascent to the top. It was surprisingly easy to maneuver the ice wall and I made it to the top without falling.Made it!Then, I closed my eyes and prepared myself for the “trust fall” of a lifetime.I leaned back, as I was instructed, the rope remained strong and I was able to slowly moonwalk back down the ice wall to where I began. When I planted my feet securely back onto the ground, I let out a big sigh of achievement.I definitely earned my Outdoor Explorer Badge for this one.As we were finishing up the tour, the guides stumbled upon a really cool ice cave that we were able to explore. The light shined through the ice making it appear bright blue. It was beautiful!We wrapped up our hike on the glacier and, as if the day needed to be any more amazing, we made one last stop on the drive back to Reykjavik at the iconic Icelandic Skógafoss waterfall. The weather didn’t make for great photos, but it was seriously impressive to see in person.Skógafoss WaterfallOur guides did an amazing job of leading us through the glacier. Even in the rain, it was a seriously cool experience and I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Iceland. Especially if you’re a big old scaredy pants like me. More InformationTour: Blue IceCompany: Arctic AdventuresCost: From 15.990 ISK per person (approx. $150 USD)Useful Notes: I rented hiking boots and waterproof pants and a jacket for the tour. I didn’t pack anything too adventure-proof for my trip to Iceland because I really only needed them for this tour. Save the luggage space and rent what you need, unless you’ll need them for your whole trip.I should mention the ice climbing part is totally optional, so if you are scared or physically unable to climb, you can skip that part. There were people of all ages on our tour, included younger kids and seniors. Special thanks to Arctic Adventures for helping me fulfill a travel dream and conquer my fears. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-blue-lagoon-iceland/,Visiting the Blue Lagoon in Iceland,Iceland,"Updated: January 2020It’s safe to say that visiting the Blue Lagoon in Iceland is on just about everyone’s bucket list. It’s milky blue water and otherworldly appearance is like something out of a dream. But before my first trip to Iceland, I had read plenty of articles about the Blue Lagoon and there were a couple of common themes: it’s expensive and it will ruin your hair.I must admit I found neither to be the case for me personally.I’ve now traveled to Iceland twice, and the Blue Lagoon has been on my must-do list both times. My last visit was a 10-day road trip along the Ring Road in a camper van, and by the last day, I could not have been more excited to lounge “lagoon-side” and spend the day relaxing at the Blue Lagoon.Here are my tips for visiting the Blue Lagoon in Iceland! Facts About the Blue LagoonThe Blue Lagoon is actually a manmade lagoon; it’s basically one of the world’s most amazing pools. A nearby power plant, Svartsengi, was drilling to create electricity and hot water for nearby communities and the Blue Lagoon was originally an accidental byproduct of this process.The Blue Lagoon is now a Geothermal Spa (with water temperature around 37-40°C or 98-104°F) and is run like most other day spas you find around the world. There is accommodation, as well as saunas, restaurants & cafes, lockers, showers, etc.The geothermal water features three active ingredients: Silica, Algae & Minerals.While it looks blue, the water is actually white. If you pour it into a transparent cup, it will have a milky white color. The sun simply makes it look blue!Read More:The Best Time to Travel to IcelandThe Ultimate Iceland Travel Guide How Much Does the Blue Lagoon Cost?As an avid day spa seeker, I actually find day spas to be an amazing affordable luxury in my travels. While I can’t afford to drop $100 on a massage everywhere I go, $60 USD for day-use at a spa is well worth the mini-splurge.A little pampering can go a long way!I recommend opting for the standard package (€54). You get your own towel, locker, and access to the Lagoon, saunas and showers, silica mud mask, and a drink free. I definitely made the most of my visit and stayed for about 4 hours.You’ll also find as much FREE silica mud as you want located in convenient swim-up buckets around the Lagoon. I definitely wasn’t expecting that and it was a huge bonus.Naturally, I covered myself in it. Twice.Alcohol around Iceland is just plain expensive. There’s no way around it. But, I was expecting a beer at the Lagoon to be beyond my Iceland budget. To my surprise, the awesome swim-up bar sold a large draft beer for $8.50. That’s about what you’d pay at any other day spa, sporting event or amusement park.I had an amazing experience at the Blue Lagoon and highly recommend planning a visit while traveling in Iceland!    Will the Blue Lagoon Ruin My Hair?As a blonde, water is my hair’s worst enemy. I’ve definitely had issues with everything from green hair problems after a swim in a pool to breakage from too much ocean water.I was seriously worried about everything I’d heard about the Blue Lagoon damaging my hair.Again, I found this widespread concern to not really be an issue at all for me. First, I wet my hair with the shower water and then lathered on a coating of conditioner before getting in. Many girls had their hair up in buns and swim caps, but I was adamant about getting an epic shot in the Lagoon, so I went all in.After washing and drying, my hair did feel slightly “crispy,” but nothing too concerning. More hair tips below! How to Prevent & Treat “Blue Lagoon” HairTo prevent that mineral buildup, pack a clarifying shampoo and a deep-conditioner that doesn’t contain protein. I actually emailed my hairdresser back home for tips to share on my blog and here’s what he said:“There’s nothing to worry about. It’s not damaged it’s mineral buildup. You just have to clarify it out, then recondition.”Get a clarifying shampoo and use it 2-3 times each time you shower.Then, use a regular daily shampoo.Rinse thoroughly then towel blot out some of the water and put a deep conditioner on the mids and ends of your hair. Don’t use a conditioner with any protein, just pure moisture.After one wash with a clarifying shampoo and an overnight deep condition, my hair was 100% back to normal!Read More:How to Protect and Treat ""Blue Lagoon"" Hair Other Helpful TipsThe Blue Lagoon is about 45 minutes outside of Reykjavik and about 20 minutes away from the airport. There are shuttle transfers available to the Lagoon from both locations. A local mentioned a good way of visiting is on the day you leave before you head to the airport (if time allows). That way you’re relaxed for your flight!The water is not hot. It felt more like warm bathwater. Though, after swimming around to different areas, I did find that the warmest spots were oddly located near the placement of trashcans.The weather in Iceland is highly unpredictable. I’d often experience all four season in a single day! Don’t let bad weather keep you from going to the Blue Lagoon. It rained, hailed and then got sunny all within the time I was there.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-treviso-italy/,"The ‘Other’ Venice: An Ultimate Guide to Treviso, Italy",Italy,"Italy has always been one of my top European destinations. With an unrivaled culinary landscape, picturesque countryside, and countless cultural icons, it’s such a diverse and fascinating country.When I met my boyfriend, Meyer, he had just moved back to Cape Town after spending quite a bit of time in Treviso, Italy. Playing rugby for Benetton for five years—he had become a local. Seeing Treviso (or the “other Venice” as it’s often called) through his eyes was absolutely wonderful.While traveling Venice is worthwhile, overcrowding is a real issue there and you can feel a bit lost in the masses. Locals and travelers alike tend to agree that Treviso is actually the idyllic version of Venice.It has that intimate and romantic vibe that so many of us are chasing in Venice.If you’re looking for a place more under the radar where you can experience the magic of Italian life, Treviso is for you.What  to Expect in TrevisoFondly referred to as “little Venice,” the historical heart of Treviso is housed inside of the Medieval city walls. It’s an easy city to get around and the main train station will take you to and from anywhere in Italy!If you’re renting a car to explore more the country, I’d recommend parking it at your hotel or finding a spot outside of the central city. Parking is tricky and a car is more of a hassle than a help in Treviso.If you’ll be in town for a couple of days, consider renting a bicycle.The thing I loved the most about Treviso is that there is very little foreign tourism. Rather than wandering around with other tourists, you get to interact with locals. It’s truly an authentic Italian gem.Most people speak some level of English and I found everyone super friendly—actually, more so than anywhere else I’ve ever been to in Italy!Fun Fact:As I learned through Meyer, Italy’s top rugby club is based in Treviso, so you’ll get a chance to dip into the sports culture a bit too!   Food in TrevisoI’ve talked to you before about eating like a local in Italy, and one central aspect of that is eating fresh and local. Eating seasonal and traditional dishes isn’t just an option here, it’s the standard.Located within the Venato region, you’ll typically find traditional Venetian and Northern Italian food in Treviso. At nearly every eatery, this means a meal with Aperol Spritz, tiramisu, and prosecco.Treviso is the birthplace of tiramisu and their Prosecco is produced in the hills right outside of the city.Yum!While this dream combo would be enough to tide me over at every meal, there’s so much more to sample here. Here’s what to expect, meal by meal.   Typical Breakfast (7 am – Lunchtime)Cafes are often referred to as bars and they’re the standard morning pitstop. Try brioche (a bready, croissant-like delight) either plain or filled Nutella, chocolate or marmalata. Order it with a cappucco, the local ways of saying cappuccino.Breakfast Hacks: Avoiding dairy as I do can sometimes be tricky but, luckily, many cafes offer soya milk now so it’s easy to find vegan coffee drinks. If you’re in the mood for an iced coffee, I’d highly recommend the shaken chilled espresso drink: shakerato.If you’re staying at a hotel with breakfast, you’ll likely find it’s an all-pastry affair. Most places don’t do the Western-style egg breakfast so, if you’re looking for it, check before making plans.Lunch (12 pm-2 pm)Many restaurants are open during just a short window for lunch. You’ll find typical Italian options like pasta and fish, and occasionally some spots will have a salad.SiestaPlaces tend to be closed on Mondays and daily from 1 to 4 pm. From post offices to retail stores to restaurants, you’ll find everyone closing up shop midday. Keep in mind this a loose schedule too so it’s not worth waiting at the door at 4 pm.Like much of the Mediterranean area, Mondays are typically the “day of rest” in Treviso. Shops might stay completely closed the entire day or they’ll re-open in the evening from around 4 pm.  Aperitivo (5:30 pm – Dinner)The “happy hour” of Treviso is normally after work hours. Locals fill the city center for drinks and small bites. Find something to nibble on to soak in the experience and whet your appetite…but don’t fill up yet!Dinner (from 7:30 pm)Treviso doesn’t have the late evening dinner culture you might find in other parts of Italy. People will typically stop after work for that quick drink and snack then have a proper meal within a couple of hours.When it comes to the standard plates, you will find the traditional Northern dishes use butter rather than olive oil and go for fewer tomatoes and more wine.Gelato (After Dinner)After dinner, locals will take a stroll around town to get a scoop of gelato. It’s a great way to socialize and soak in the beauty of the town.You can never have enough gelato!  Where to EatIt’s hard to go wrong in a place like Treviso. Far from the bland tourist restaurants, you’ll find in other parts of the country, you will find impressive restaurants on every corner here.Da Pino: For the most famous pizza in an area famous for its pizza, try Da Pino in the center of the town square.Giardino Bistro: This is the perfect quick spot to fill up on a fresh sandwich. They are open Mondays, but closed all day on Sundays, and on Saturdays, they close at 12:30 pm.Helmut Pub: If you’re in the mood for a good old fashioned burger and beer, look no further than Helmut Pub.Toni del Spin: This Venetian spot claims to have invented tiramisu. Stop by to decide for yourself if it’s truly the best in the world.Trattoria dei Bana ai Buranelli: I adore this cute spot on the canal for a leisurely dinner of locally sourced food and wine.Odeon alla Colonna: This enchanting place is right on the canal and perfect for lunch or dinner.Filodrammatici: This is a fave spot amongst locals for a traditional meal. Stop by for an informal meal in the center of the city.Osteria Arman: If you’re looking to try home-style cooking just like nonni would make, you need to check out Osteria Arman.Ristorante Terrazza San Tomaso: For the best seafood in Treviso, it’s all about Ristorante Terrazza San Tomaso.Zeus: This family-owned pizza and pasta place is an essential stop when you’re craving carbs. Try the wood-fired Neapolitan pizza and you’ll be back.  Spritz + SnacksAperitivo is a way of life! Going out around 6 pm and unwinding after a long day is an essential part of life in Treviso.La Roggia: This is one of the most popular hangouts. It’s the prime place to go when you’re looking to mingle with locals and get a sense of what life is like in Treviso.Tavernetta Butterfly: For an aperitivo with fresh local seafood, this is the place to be.Osteria by Gigia: This famous spot is renowned for its mozzarella in carrozza and world-class wine.Hosteria Dai Naneti: This one is my all-time fave! Come ready for a smorgasbord of meat, cheese, and wine. Just try to pace yourself so you’re still ready for dinner afterward.  GelatoIf you’ve made it through your aperitivo and dinner, start a stroll through town until you’ve worked up an appetite for the final cherry on top! Here are the best gelato spots.Dassie: There are two Dassie locations in town so it’s easy to swing by for a creamy scoop of heavenly gelato.Romano: Heaven in a cone! You can thank me later.Grom: Right in the center of town, you’ll find another top-notch gelato spot.  Where to StayIn Treviso, you’ll generally come across a range of bed and breakfast and mid-range hotel options. There’s not much for luxe or boutique options but you’ll get a great experience for the price in a few different spots.B&B Hotel Treviso: With a dream location, this super affordable spot is a perfect base for exploring the city.Maison Matilda: In the middle of the action, beside Piazza Duomo, this boutique hotel ticks all the boxes.Hotel Il Focolare: This is definitely one of the cutest spots in town and the location is primo, however, their customer service really let me down. Perhaps you’ll have a better experience!   ShoppingWhile Treviso is no Milan, you can find all of the essentials in the local shops.Ivo Il mio Macellaio: For quick and easy picnic picks, this little place has a butcher and deli inside for a quick and fresh option.Conad City: This supermarket is handy for stocking up on all the essentials during your stay.Flying Tiger Copenhagen: For any odds and ends, Tiger is always the place to go. From socks to locks to trinkets for your house, this fun spot is a local favorite.     What  to DoLa bella vita (the good life) is one of the charms of Italy and nowhere more so than Treviso. Life moves slower here. People take the time to literally stop and smell the roses. Coffee is drunk with friends over a few laughs rather than guzzled in a rush on the way to work.Treviso is not a place to tick off your bucket list while you’re hurrying to the next hotspot. Come here ready to experience an authentically Italian city void of tourists.This stunning little city needs to be fully appreciated step by step. Stroll around and explore the nooks and crannies. Rent a bike and just see where the day takes you.Walk the city wall and be sure to stop by Bistro Sulle Mura during the warmer months. They’ve got live music in the evenings during summer.Visit the fish market for the freshest of fresh seafood. This place is open daily but you’ll want to get there early to beat the locals to the best catch of the day.And most importantly, eat like a local! Lingering over a long dinner is one of the best parts of Italian life. Go on a food tour. Book a cooking class.Whatever you do and wherever you go in Treviso, do it with a full stomach!

There is so much to see and do there, and it’s just a 40-minute train trip.Jesolo: While the beaches of Northern Italy don’t tend to get much love from international tourists, Jesolo is one of the biggest and best beach resorts in the country.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-the-amalfi-coast-in-italy/,Tips for Visiting the Amalfi Coast in Italy,Italy,"There’s a reason the Amalfi Coast is on many of our travel bucket lists. While I would certainly recommend popular Italian cities like Rome, Florence, and Venice, the Amalfi Coast has its own unique magic.Some of the Amalfi Coast’s most popular destinations are Amalfi, Sorrento, Salerno, Positano, Ravello, Praiano, and Maiori. And, of course, you can easily pop over to the island of Capri by ferry.Wind through the narrow roads as you overlook the seaside cliffs from Sorrento to Positano. Sail along the incredible coastline at sunset. Stop for the most beautiful hike of your life then fill up on heavenly lemon desserts.La dolce vita is every day here.Ready for the Italian escape of your dreams? Here are my tips for visiting the Amalfi Coast in Italy! Take a Tour of the Amalfi CoastDuring my first trip to the Amalfi Coast, I explored the coastline and the ruins of ancient Pompeii with the Walks of Italy tour.I had such a fabulous experience (read all about it here) and would highly recommend it for getting your bearings during the first visit—or if you’re just wanting to do a day trip to the Amalfi Coast.Book a recommended tour here!Visit for a Day or a WeekYou can take day tours from Rome or you can travel to the area and spend as long as you like. So if you’re limited on time, know that it is possible to visit the Amalfi Coast in just a day to get a quick sample…and maybe you’ll just have to plan another trip in the future. 😉 Getting to the Amalfi CoastThere are a few different ways to explore the Amalfi Coast: taking a train and then a bus, hiring a private bus, or ferrying in. If you’re coming from elsewhere in Italy, I would recommend taking the train into Naples, then transferring to the regional train: the Circumvesuviana.This is this railway service running through the area east of Naples. It’s operated by EAV Ente Autonomo Volturno so you can get all of the scheduling details there.The Circumvesuviana train line is a bit rough around the edges but efficiently connects Naples with Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Sorrento. Once you get into Sorrento, there are local buses that will take you to popular spots like Positano (I’ll go into more on that below).Yes, getting around takes a bit of planning, but I would still recommend public transport. The roads are pretty crazy to take on with a rental car and things get expensive quickly.That said, it is doable to rent a car which would allow you more freedom and exploring options…However, the “controlled chaos” of Italian roads—especially as you get farther south—means that you definitely need some extra insurance coverage for all of the little metal kisses Italian cars love to give each other.Helpful Tip:To beat the crowd and take the scenic route, ferries are a good option. There is an extensive network connecting the Amalfi Coast with Salerno, Sorrento and Capri. Just note these are seasonal as the whole region is really a warm-weather destination; ferries are also dependent on weather conditions. Traveling Around by BusThere are options for private buses, too. Positano Shuttle Bus will take you from Naples Central Train Station to Positano for €35 then drop you right off at your hotel. While you can get a private bus from Rome, it’s a bit pricey.The public bus system is a cheap and efficient way to get between the little towns of the Amalfi Coast—and locals do it all the time.Just remember to come ready for the winding roads! It is a bit of a rough ride and far from luxe but it will take you where you want to go.When you arrive on the Amalfi Coast, get a SITA bus pass. You can get a 24-hour ticket for less than 10 USD that will take you through all the quaint little towns on the coast. Simply hop on the bus in front of the Sorrento train station and buy a ticket from the driver. You can usually purchase tickets at tobacconists, newsstands and some bars/cafes, too.Hop off at the La Sponda stop in Positano for a beautiful walk.While it’s easy to find your way around and the buses are clearly marked, come ready for a crowd! The bus out of Sorrento to Amalfi only comes once an hour and you’ve got to be in line to get on board. From Positano to Amalfi, sometimes it’s so crowded they don’t even stop…be prepared as you’re going to have to run on Italian time.Note: It’s very common for folks to stand when the bus is particularly crowded. Make sure to find somewhere to hold on as there are many narrow twists and turns along the way.   Amalfi Coast AccommodationsAccommodations of every type are expensive on the Amalfi Coast—it’s truly a vacation town. Italians and international tourists alike adore the place and that means visits come at a pretty penny.Book early to beat the crowd.Like many of the local services, the bulk of hotels are seasonal so you’ll find them shuttered up through the coolest months (November until around Easter). During the summer, every place worth its salt is sold out almost every night.As you searching for hotel options, check out their transport offerings.Some of them offer a private car or boat shuttle to get you between Naples and other local destinations. Little perks like this can save some cash!Search Amalfi Coast Hotel Availability Below: Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');   PositanoVisit in the Shoulder SeasonsThe high season for visiting the Amalfi Coast runs between June to August. While the weather is flawless, the crowds (and the prices!) can get a bit overwhelming. This is especially true in iconic towns like Positano and Amalfi.If you can make it happen, the best time to visit the Amalfi Coast is during the spring or autumn. All of Italy is in top form, especially near the coast where waters are the ideal temp.Best of all, Italian food is at its prime in spring and autumn. Local dishes make heavy use of whatever is in season and, at this time of year, we’re talking black truffles, mushrooms, and chestnuts.Yum!! Try the Local FoodItaly has some of the best food on earth. I’ve talked to you before about how to eat like a local in Italy and chowing down is at the heart of every good celebration is a good meal—even if you’re just celebrating a Tuesday night!On nearly every menu along the Amalfi Coast, you’ll find spaghetti alle vongole (spaghetti with fresh clams).After you get loaded up on carbs, treat yourself to one of the many local lemon desserts. From classic lemon cakes to limoncello, you’ve got to get at least a bit of all of them.In typical laid-back Southern European style, it’s also essential to plan ample time to linger over coffee and people watch. The charming plazas under the shade of huge churches are just what you need to refresh.    Go for a HikeYou’ll find endlessly winding hiking paths that will take you from one sweeping view to the next. After you’ve gotten warmed up walking the many stairways of Positano, get over to the Path of the Gods.Called Sentiero degli Dei in Italian, this beautiful path offers nearly non-stop ocean views.You’ll find little lemonade stands and locals selling fruit along the way, so be sure to bring some spare change!    Beach DaysRent a beach chair!You’ll want at least one day at the beach but keep in mind that won’t come cheap. Be prepared to pay anywhere from seven to 20 euros for a beach chair…but it’s so worth it! Forget sandy stretches near the sea—the majority of the beaches are rocky and bringing along a towel just isn’t going to cut it.Helpful Tip:For the most part, it’s first come first serve when it comes to beach chairs. So if you want a good spot, be prepared to get there early!   Take a Trip to Pompeii and HerculaneumI would highly recommend exploring Pompeii and Herculaneum with a guide.Going with a local expert will add valuable depth to the experience. Going solo, it’s easy to miss spots that aren’t well labeled and not get everything you could out of the experience.Pompeii is about a 1-hour drive from the town of Positano, so it’s an easy day trip from the Amalfi Coast.While Pompeii frequently gets all the attention (it’s the larger of the two ruins), Herculaneum is a fantastic place for art history enthusiasts as more of the mosaics are preserved.    Visit the Island of CapriCapri is only a short ferry ride away…so you might as well explore all its magnificence! Famed for its rugged landscape and gorgeous hotels, you’ve definitely got to check out the Blue Grotto while you’re here! OverallThe Amalfi Coast is such a wonderful place to visit in Italy and I always want to return back. Though it can get crowded and it’s not always budget-friendly, it’s well worth the visit.Have you been to the Amalfi Coast before? I’d love to hear about your experience in the comments below! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-the-prosecco-vending-machine-in-italy/,Tips for Visiting the Prosecco Vending Machine in Italy,Italy,"Is there anything more magical than sipping a glass of prosecco while taking in the idyllic views of Italy? Food and drink are at the heart of la dolce vita and everything in Italy centers around the culinary delicacies.In my Ultimate Guide to Eating Like Local in Italy, I talked about devouring all the delights available in Italy—from Positano to Venice. But now, my friends, it’s time to bring on the sparkling wine…in the form of one of the coolest vending machines in the world! Wait, what?There is a vending machine in Italy that dispenses prosecco!Move over Doritos and Coca-Cola! Not only can you select prosecco, but you’ll also find wine, and even olives and biscotti! That’s not to say that every machine in Italy is dishing out the goods but you will find this one in the Prosecco region in the northern part of Italy.In case you missed it on Instagram, I was absolutely geeking out over the vending machine I found in Prosecco. Right next to the machine? An “honesty” kitchen in a remote stone farmhouse—where you can find local cheese, bread, and cured meats. Once you are fully stocked up, you move over to a picture-perfect picnic.Here are my tips for visiting the Prosecco Vending Machine in Italy!  Le Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano e ValdobbiadeneGetting to the Prosecco RegionThe Prosecco region, also known as the mouthful Le Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene, is a European fairy tale. With wineries and old farmhouse nestled in the vine-covered terraces, this area is a foodie (and wino!) paradise.To get to the Prosecco region, you’ll want to fly into Venice or Treviso. Both cities have international airports and are well-connected by train. When you arrive and want to explore the area, you can hire a local taxi driver.Fun fact: The Prosecco region is one of the latest and greatest additions to the list of UNESCO world heritage sites. It is also the only region in the world where Prosecco can be produced.Helpful Tip:Forget the town of Prosecco! While it is a lovely spot, it’s not where you want to go on a wine tour. Indeed the drink of Prosecco was first created here in the sixteenth century but, in the twenty-first century, this place really has nothing to do with the production of sparkling wine.  My Tips for a Day TripI’ve been to amazing winelands in South Africa as well as vineyards around the world. However, the Prosecco region is drastically different. Pairings aren’t a big deal, nor is learning about what makes the bubbly different from other varieties.Don’t expect a typical wine tasting experience.The Prosecco area is less of a tourist trap than many areas, especially considering how famous their sparkling wine is. When you go to Le Colline del Prosecco di Conegliano e Valdobbiadene (you can refer to it just as Valdobbiadene), you will want to plan in advance. The best attractions aren’t obvious on arrival.Read up on the best places to visit and research which wineries or tasting places you’d like to go to. Heads up, there isn’t much English spoken in the region and there’s not much chit chat when sampling the sparkling wines. It’s more about soaking in the scenery…and enjoying the slight buzz. 😉Helpful Tip:You will need a reservation for pretty much everywhere so book early!   How to Visit  the Prosecco Vending MachineOnce you’ve sampled a few varieties, it’s vending machine time! The best place to begin your journey is at Osteria Senz’Oste (senz’oste means “without a host” in Italian)—this is the “honesty” kitchen I mentioned earlier. Here, you can pick up all of your picnic supplies in the open farmhouse.You’ll find areas to sit inside of the Osteria along with some picnic tables outside that offer a view of the hills. While it’s a nice place for a break, keep going! Bag up your supplies and head up the hill to get your sparkling wine. Just follow the signs (like breadcrumbs) that say ‘Prosecco.’The Prosecco Vending Machine was easily one of the highlights of my Italian sojourn. It was just such a quirky little attraction! After all of the wine regions I’ve explored, the Prosecco region still managed to pull a trick out of its sleeve.That said, it’s a somewhat controversial object. Vending machines don’t exactly have the best reputations so some people think they aren’t fit to hold the renowned Prosecco wine. For me, wine doesn’t need pomp and circumstance. A good bottle of wine is a good bottle of wine, whether it’s served by a world-class sommelier or a vending machine.The prosecco is very reasonably priced with options under 20 euros and some even under 10!We opted for a brut wine and, with so many options, we went for the one with the coolest label (because how else does one choose?). There was a futuristic-looking arm that gently grabbed the bottle then handed it over.Cheers to that! OverallWhile the Prosecco Vending Machine has become a small-time tourist attraction, it’s the Italians who really love it. You’ll find locals who use this as their local picnic space. It has a laid-back vibe that is just what I was looking for on my Italian escape.I have heard that there are several different prosecco machines in this region. Know of another one? I’d love for you to share in the comments below!Want to see what the Prosecco Vending Machine looks like in action?

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-eating-like-local-in-italy/,The Ultimate Guide to Eating Like a Local in Italy,Italy,"Like so many places around the globe, food is at the heart of Italian culture. If you want to see the real Italy, you need to dig into the customs and traditions surrounding Italian cuisine. And to do that—you’ve got to sample all the food.Oh darn. 😉However, “Italian food” is a bit of a misnomer. In reality, wherever you go in Italy, you will find distinctions in both food and traditions. So Italian food in Venice completely differs from what you’ll find in say Sicily.Typical dishes and cultural practices actually differ quite a bit from Northern to Southern Italy.A major reason for the unique food in each region is the difference in climate and seasonality. Italy is very adamant about it’s DOP (Denominazione di Origine Protetta)—which translates to Protected Designation of Origin; essentially they ensure and protect that products are locally grown and packaged.Wondering how locals eat and what the food culture is like? I’m dishing up the goods!Here is my ultimate guide to eating like a local in Italy. Mangia bene!  RomeCoffee CultureItalian coffee culture is actually quite unique. You might be used to ordering your Starbucks grande latte “to-go” in the afternoon. There are a few “non-Italian” things about this particular order.The first thing to know is that milk-based coffees are generally only consumed in the morning with breakfast. There are a couple of theories about why this is the case…Some people say it is because drinking milk after eating will cause a stomachache. Others say that it is just based on the old tradition of drinking milk as soon as the milkman delivers it so that it doesn’t spoil. Whatever the case, most people wouldn’t dare to order a cappuccino in the afternoon.Literally, you’ll get the side-eye.Second, baristas will expect you to drink your coffee at the bar or your table. That means no “to-go.” That said, you will find that most coffees are far smaller than you might be used to, so it’s easy to drink them in a few sips.Helpful Tip:Lastly, when you order coffee in Italy, bear in mind that a latte is just foamed milk. In order of milkiness, starting from least milky, you can order a cafe stretto (espresso), cafe macchiato (small cappuccino), cappuccino, or latte macchiato (similar to a latte you’d order back home). If you’re like me an prefer an iced coffee, order a shakerato (basically shaken espresso on ice).   Foods You’ll Find All Over ItalyA typical breakfast in Italy consists of brioche (which is actually a croissant) and a coffee (typically a cappuccino). Other foods you’ll DEFINITELY find wherever you roam? Gelato on gelato, cheese, grappa and limoncello, and copious amounts of wine. It’s very, very easy to eat and drink yourself silly!But hey, when in Rome! 😉(Speaking of Rome, check out this amazing food tour in Rome if you’re planning a visit!)Read More: Tips for Visiting the Prosecco Vending Machine in ItalyRegional SpecialtiesNorthern Italy: Fish, Pasta (such as Vongole), Tiramisu (it is the birthplace, after all!), and Prosecco (the birthplace of Spritz Aperol)Southern Italy: Pasta, Pizza (the birthplace being Napoli), Caponata, and Eggplant ParmigianaSardinia: Suckling Pig (as in a large roast)Sicily: Arancini, Caponata, and CanoliHelpful Tip:The time of year will affect many aspects of your visit, especially the food as it’s very seasonal! Here’s what you need to know to choose the best time to travel to Italy.  About  the MealAs soon as you sit down, the server will ask if you’d like acqua naturale (still water) or frizzante (carbonated) water. You will find that while water is served cold, you typically have to ask for ice.Wine is also a common dinner drink and that will be the next question! You’ll usually order by the glass or bottle, but you’ll often also see servings of 1-liter or 0.5-liters in rosso (red) or bianco (white).Whatever drink you opt for, whether it is soda, water or wine, don’t expect free refills. Meal CoursesWhen it comes to ordering dinner, you will find several options. It is important to keep in mind that Italian meals are rarely just one big dish. Instead, locals tend to order their meals in courses—many, many courses! Here’s a typical breakdown:Aperitivo: This will be your first few sips and bites to “prepare your stomach for a meal.” Think Spritz Aperol along with a tapa like olives or meatballs.Antipasti: Your starter. Often it’ll be a small plate of meat and cheese.Primi: This is the first course of hot food. Traditionally it is a vegetarian pasta dish.Secondi: In your second course, this normally consists of meat or seafood.Contorini: This is essentially a side dish that will be served with your second course. It’s usually vegetables to go with the meat.Insalata: After you eat your second course, you might opt for a small salad.Formaggi E Frutta: Hello, cheese and fruit combos!Dolce: Did you save room for dessert after all that?Caffe: Italians often end their meals with a shot of espresso.Digestivo: Certain alcoholic drinks like limoncello, amaro, and grappa are believed to help with digestion.Helpful Tip:In certain parts of Italy, after dinner, there is a very special ritual called fare la scarpetta. This means to “do the small shoe” and it is a bit like a more polite version of licking your plate clean. To fare la scarpetta, you just use the bread on your table to sop up the last bit of sauce.  Etiquette for Dining at Someone’s HomeIf you are lucky enough to be invited into an Italian home for dinner, there are a few minor pieces of etiquette to consider.Generally speaking, it is best to eat at a similar pace as your host. Finishing everything on your plate is basically a request for seconds. Meanwhile leaving a lot of food on your plate is considered a sign you didn’t like the food.Sunday lunches are an important meal on every Italian’s calendar. If you receive an invite, bring a dessert. Anything from the local bakery or a tub of gelato to share with everyone is greatly appreciated.  TrevisoTipping + The BillThere are no expectations for tipping. Locals will typically just leave a bit of change to even out their bill but nothing more (e.g. leaving €40 for a bill of €37.85). If you are at a high-end restaurant, you *might* leave ten percent to acknowledge truly exceptional service, but normally, service will already be included and disclosed on the menu or receipt.One major thing to note is that restaurants will not bring you the bill when you’ve finished your meal. You must ask or you will be there all night. I actually really love this as it’s ingrained in the culture to take your time and savor the meal and the company—there’s no need to rush.You can ask for the bill by saying, “Il conto, per favore.”   Ordering PastaYou will find that traditional Italian pasta dishes do not include meat (unless you’re in the north, where fish is common). Spaghetti and meatballs will be hard to come by, as are fettuccine alfredo and chicken parmesan.There are also standardized combinations of pasta and sauce. While we might just put penne or farfalle with whatever sauce we have on hand, Italians would have set combinations.Check out this interesting breakdown of the pairings!Ready to say ciao? Here is everything you need to know before your first trip to Italy.So, what Italian foods are you wanting to try? Allllll of them? I don’t blame you!

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-italy/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Italy,Italy,"Italy has captivated the hearts of many (and for good reason). What’s not to love about endless amounts of pasta, glasses upon glasses of wine, historical sites everywhere you turn, colorful architecture, and turquoise beaches?But before you pack your bags and eat your weight in gelato, there are a few things to keep in mind.Here are 10 tips for your first trip to Italy!  Italians Practice the Siesta“Siestas” are a practice in some European countries where people go home in the afternoon to eat lunch with their families and take a nap. In Italy, some businesses and even police stations in small towns will close down from 1 PM to 3 PM for the siesta.When planning your itinerary for Italy, always check the opening hours of shops and restaurants. You might find it hard to grab a meal at your normal lunchtime, so it’s a good idea to keep some snacks on you.Most Italians also only eat dinner around 8 PM. Luckily, you can take partake in the traditional Italian “aperitivo.” It’s a drink and light meal that restaurants will offer until it’s dinner time.Read More: The Ultimate Italy Travel Guide  VeniceCustomer Service in ItalyCustomer service is quite different than what you’re used to in the States. While greeting people is essential, waitstaff doesn’t hover over tables.In fact, you might have to wave someone down when you need a refill, or when you’re ready to pay. Don’t take it personally. It’s just the culture! The Language BarrierWhile some people do speak English, it’s not the norm and shouldn’t be expected. You’ll also find that most signage will be in Italian.Before you leave for your trip, download an app like Duolingo, and learn some essential Italian phrases. I’d also recommend buying a local sim card so you can use Google Maps to help you figure out the local transportation system without asking for help.Business HoursIn addition to the hours that are closed for siestas, a lot of businesses have shorter hours on the weekends so you’ll want to plan your visit ahead of time. Don’t expect businesses to be open later than 1:30 to 2 PM on Saturdays and many choose to take Sunday off.As for restaurants, many are closed on Mondays so keep that in mind if there’s a restaurant that you’ve been dying to try!   Driving in ItalyWhile driving through Italian wine country is something everyone should experience at least once in their life, you don’t technically need a car when in Italy. Using public transportation is the most cost-effective way to get around plus it is super easy to use.If you’re using the train in Italy, remember to get your ticket validated and if you do decide to drive, knowing how to drive manual will save you some serious money.

It’s typically listed on the menu so if you check beforehand, and you won’t be caught by surprise.There will also likely be a “Servizio” charge which replaces the tip more or less. It’s often found in areas that are heavily visited by tourists such as Rome, Venice, the Amalfi Coast, and Florence.It’s usually between 10% to 20% and can also be found listed on the menu.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Eating Like a Local in Italy  Vineyards in TuscanyTry the WineIf you’re a wine lover like me, you can’t go to Italy and not try some of the regional wines!

The contrast of the lush landscape and the plunging coastal cliffs is unbelievably picture-worthy.It’s the ideal spot to explore by foot, do some serious shopping, and eat and drink authentic Italian food and wine. Just be sure to order a meal with capers as they are essential to much of the local cuisine.Some of Sicily’s best grapes are grown on Salina, so buy a bottle or join a tasting tour to one of the vineyards on the island.Day 3: PanareaThis exclusive and expensive island is the smallest of the Aeolians. With jasmine, bougainvillea, small white villages, and car-free streets, it’s unlike any other island you will come across. It’s a summer-only destination with very little activity happening outside of the summer months. In fact, if you show up between November to April, you’ll find that most places close seasonally.On the tour, it will be the perfect spot to get away from life for a bit and enjoy the natural beauty of the island.Day 4: StromboliWant to see a real-life volcano explosion? Then Stromboli is the spot for you. Most famous for its nighttime eruptions, it coined the nickname the “Lighthouse of the Mediterranean.” In fact, it’s been erupting continuously for two thousand years. You can take a guided hike up to the top at sunset. Just be warned– it’s hot!Famous film-makers and style-setters, like Dolce and Gabbana, own villas to spend holidays there, and tourists from all around the world visit to see the dramatic Aeolian island. If you’ve got the time, be sure to watch the sunset and keep an eye out for the Sciara del Fuoco, where the lava flows into the sea.Day 5: LipariOut of all the islands you will visit, Lipari is the largest and most populated yet it somehow still feels untouched and preserved. You will be able to experience the small town feel all while having plenty of restaurants, museums, bars, hotels, and shops to visit. It’s colorful seafront and busy little port makes it the most convenient base for island hopping.If you’ve got the time, the eastern coast of the island offers old pumice quarries. The bright white stone gives the sea a very vibrant turquoise color, making for a swim you won’t forget.While on Lipari, visit Quattrochi. It’s a short scooter ride out of Lipari town or an hours hike. From the lookout, you can see endless blue sea and smoke rising from the neighboring island, Vulcano. It’s a picture perfect view!Day 6: VulcanoVulcano is the closest island to Sicily, and its name stems from Hephaestus, the God of Fire. Fitting right? When you first approach the island, you’ll immediately see the plumes of smoke rising from the sunset. However, there’s so much more to this island than its famous volcanic black sand beach.Take a cooking class or visit a local goat cheese farm for a taste of local culture.Porto Levante is a local mud pool known for its mineral-rich mud. Despite the strong smell of sulfur, the mud has healing properties for the skin. And don’t forget to stop by the hot springs, they’re a truly sacred hot-spot.Day 7: PortorosaOn the last day, you will sail back to Portorosa to disembark the yacht!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-yacht-week-italy/,The Ultimate Guide to The Yacht Week Italy,Italy,"Leading up to The Yacht Week Italy, I have to admit it was the route I was most excited about. The route is actually in Sicily which is still part of Italy, but has its own unique culture and highlights.This is definitely the most posh (or luxurious) route in terms of destinations. Each little port town has major appeal for luxury travelers… and for good reason.For that reason, I’ve included information below that highlights The Yacht Week Italy!Rated on a scale of 1 (low) – 5 (high)Nightlife: 3The Yacht Week Italy is more tame than some of the other routes, though there are some great clubs and parties. There’s a different sophistication about the nightlife making the Italy route unique from other routes.Day Parties: 2There aren’t really any organized day parties on the Italy route but you get the opportunity to see a LOT of the destinations you travel to. If you do want to day party, come prepared to “bring a cup of sugar.” There are some incredible opportunities to sail with other boats to gorgeous grottos and tie up for your own “rosé all day” party.Make some friends and get the party started!Activities: 5Italy was one of my favorite routes for fun-filled days. We did SO much exploring with sailing to smaller islands to swim and roaming the cute Sicilian port towns.You also get the incredible opportunity to trek an active volcano on Stromboli island. It was actually erupting the day we were supposed to hike it, so we watched the lava explode into the sky from the island of Panarea instead.Talk about a once-in-a-lifetime experience!Local Culture: 4Sicily is a special place for both food and culture. The locals are proud to be Sicilian and eager to share their unique culture with you. You’ll still find delicious Italian food here, but a traditional Sicilian meal can’t be missed.You also get to sail to some spectacular islands, like Panarea, which is frequented by the rich and famous for its gorgeous vistas and beautiful marina.Sailing Experience: 5In the famous words of Borat, “wah wah wee wah!” The Italy route brings you to some insanely beautiful locations. We saw dolphins, a smoking volcano and gorgeous islands.Side note: Ladies, this is also the best route to go topless without people gawking. Many days, you get gorgeous destinations all to yourself!Say buh-bye to tan lines!Size of Route: 2Approx. 15-25 boats per routeThe Yacht Week Italy is a smaller route which is hard to believe because it is so amazing! It’s the best route for a little bit of luxe, a whole lotta rosé and some incredible sailing.Extra Costs: 3There are a couple days on the Italy route with expensive port fees. The market in the marina at Portorosa is extremely limited and expensive so hire a taxi and drive a ways to another nearby market to save some cash.Pros of The Yacht Week Italy:Gorgeous island destinationsLocal cultureLots of fun activitiesCons of The Yacht Week Italy:Inconvenient and expensive shoppingRemote start destinationBefore You GoThere are a few key things to prepare before any trip on The Yacht Week. Obviously, finding a killer crew, booking a boat and getting travel insurance are the most important!And remember, a detailed itinerary of your week will be released 2 weeks before the event.Finding a CrewWhether you have a group of friends ready to book the trip of a lifetime or not, there are a few key ingredients to putting together a crew. First off, you want a group of open-minded, fun-loving people (with at the very least, a mild sense of responsibility).TYW is all about having a good time, but keep in mind that carrying your own weight on costs, cleanup on the boat throughout the week and planning is essential for all crew members. Also, keep in mind that TYW has a “gender ratio” on most routes- meaning you’ve gotta bring some girls. Nobody wants a bro fest.If you don’t have a big enough group of friends to fill your boat, The Yacht Week crew finder is the best resource for putting together a crew. If you’re looking to join a crew, or are looking to fill your boat, you can find awesome people there to complete your tribe.Booking a BoatOnce you’re ready to book, the process is pretty straight forward. There is only one Italy route and two different weeks to choose from in either June and July.It is important to remember that most of the boats don’t have A/C or fans in the cabins, so bring you own battery-powered fans!BOOK The Yacht Week Italy HEREGetting Travel InsuranceI know. I know. Nobody likes to talk about this stuff. But, what do you get when you mix cocktails, sunscreen and a boat deck? A blonde and a broken arm. A broken arm on a remote island means a first-class helicopter ride and thousands of dollars in medical bills. Get travel insurance.You can read more about why you need travel insurance, but consider it a small price to pay for the reassurance of a great trip. One person in your crew should also pack a First-Aid kit. Cuts and boo-boos happen all the time.Get a travel insurance quote here!What to Pack for The Yacht WeekPacking for The Yacht Week is pretty much the same whether you’re going to Italy or the BVIs. Be sure to read my complete packing guide “How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry On,” but here is a list of the essentials:BagFirst things first, do everything in your power to pack in a soft duffle bag. If everyone arrives with big, hard suitcases there is nowhere to store them and they will lay on top of your beds or in the living room. It’s the worst. Most cabins have mini-closets so you’re able to unpack most of your things and roll the duffle bag up to store completely out of your way.Duffle bag for your carry-onSmall cross body-bag for everyday useProps & ToysCountry flag for your crewWater-GunsBody-PaintInflatable rafts & floatiesMisc.Auxiliary-cordCD’s- Each boat has a different sound system setup. To be safe, I always bring an auxiliary-cord and make a handful of CD’s as well. Throw some 90’s songs on there just for nostalgia.LifeProof Waterproof iPhone CaseGoPro with Floaty BackSelfie Stick – I know they don’t make you look cool, but this is one trip you’ll want oneMulti-port chargerFloating key chain (optional)Dry-bag (optional) – if you are bringing a camera or any electronic that is not waterproofBattery powered fan for your cabin (optional) – some boats have A/C, some have fans… and some do notREAD MORE: How to Pack for The Yacht Week in a Carry OnGetting ThereThe Italy route is located between the Palermo Airport or Cantania Airport, so you can fly into either. You will begin in Marina di Portorosa in the town of Tonnarella.Arrival Day and TimeEveryone arrives at different times on Saturday but it’s best to arrive that day by 1pm to take care of check-in, grab a cocktail with your crew, then do your grocery shopping. The yachts normally set sail between 4-6pm.Departure Day and TimeYou will get back to the marina on Friday afternoon and have to check out and leave the yacht before 9am on Saturday morning. Remember the big closing party is Friday night, so pack up and get organized before you head out for the night (you may not come back to the boat until sunrise!)Extra CostsIn addition to the cost of the yacht, meals and transportation costs,  you will also have to pay for the fuel and port fees during the week that you sail.I’ve included the different prices from The Yacht Week website in the list below.The prices you see below are calculated on a Bavaria 45, which is a yacht with 10 beds. The prices will vary depending on what size of boat you choose.Total Per YachtCOUNTRY WATERFUELTAXIPORT FEESTOTALItaly$105$300$210$410 $1,000 – $1,050And last, but not least, don’t forget to tip your “skip” at the end of your trip. (They’re not just there as eye-candy. That’s just a huge bonus.)Grocery Shopping GuideI’ve consistently found that grocery shopping for a boat of 10 people costs between $1000-$1500 for the entire week. So, assume approximately $120 minimum needs to be pooled from each crew member.(NOTE: Consider your skipper an extra head to count when doing your food and booze shopping for the boat. A well-fed skipper is a happy skipper.)I found the Italy route to be the most difficult for grocery shopping. There is a measly little shop in the marina that is incredibly limited and expensive. We picked two “responsible” shoppers from our crew to catch a taxi to the nearest “bigger” grocery shop to finish the majority of our alcohol and food shopping. It was definitely more of a hassle than any other route, but we managed to get everything we needed.Be aware that there will be limited choices because it is a small town, so if there’s something you absolutely need, plan to bring it with you from home!BreakfastYogurt and granola with fresh fruit is pretty much my go-to breakfast on sailing trips. But, eggs also keep really well! Buy bagels and the fixings or some fresh bread so you can make egg sandwiches or toast. Don’t forget instant coffee if you are a morning coffee drinker!LunchIn Italy, you can’t go wrong stocking up with supplies to make a giant salad every day for lunch. Buy lots of tomatoes, onion, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, olives, mozzarella cheese balls and balsamic & olive oil. It’s easy to prepare a big portion for everyone to share, then each person can make whatever else they feel like: canned tuna, a sandwich, pasta, etc.DinnersYou can plan to eat out for most dinners — and, in Italy, you’ll find most meals organized by The Yacht Week are worth attending!Note: All boats have stovetops and small refrigerators, and most catamarans have a BBQ on the back, but double check before you head to the store.SnacksDon’t forget to buy lots of snacks! Stick to your senses- something salty, sweet, savory and sour! Lots of chips, some gummy candies, fresh fruit, dry meats & cheeses with crackers, etc. Hard boiling eggs and keeping them in a ziplock in the fridge is also a great idea for a quick protein packed snack.DrinksBuy lots of water. The rule of thumb is 1.5 liters per person per day. Best tip is that everyone brings their own refillable water bottle, then buy water in gallon jugs. As for alcohol- buy twice as much as you think you need! A few bottles of wine for meals, lots of prosecco, rosé, beer, hard alcohol and mixers!CondimentsThere might be salt and pepper on the boat, but don’t count on it. You’ll need to buy your own spices, sauces, mayonnaise, ketchup, etc.SuppliesDon’t forget things like paper towels, toilet paper, garbage bags and ziplock bags! For grilling, the charcoal bricks make life really easy.For more information visit the The Yacht Week website! More InformationBook the Yacht Week Italy Here"

However, there are certain areas and attractions in Rome that we think raise the romance bar even more.Here are our favorite romantic places for couples in Rome!Trevi FountainIt is so nice that the fountain is no longer under construction.

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-go-italy/,The Best Time to Travel to Italy,Italy,"Ciao, bella! Ready for the ultimate Mediterranean getaway? From Milan to Sicily, Italy is one of the best destinations on the planet. With its fascinating history, breathtaking natural beauty, delicious Italian food, and endless entertainment options, Italy is the place to be 365 days a year.Whether you lounge on the beach in Cala Mariolu, explore the Christmas market of Aosta Valley, or wander through the ruins of Rome, you can have an Italian dream vacation at any time of the year.Here are my tips on the best time to go to Italy! Summer in ItalyMonths: June – AugustLa dolce vita is in full swing during the sizzling months of summer. Festivals are everywhere and there’s always a reason to party. Join the locals in celebrating the national Italian holiday Festa della Repubblica on June 2nd, or watch the fireworks on August 15th while you partake in Ferragosto, another one of Italy’s biggest celebrations.While there is ample opportunity for fun in the sun, summer is also peak tourism time in Italy. In August, many Italians go away on holiday to the mountains and countryside, so if it’s your dream to sit in a quint café surrounded by locals, pick another time of year.Highlights: Festa della Repubblica & Ferragosto Autumn in ItalyMonths: September – NovemberWhile summers can be scorching in Italy, the fall months are gorgeous. Even in the northernmost areas, you’ll often find afternoon temperatures in the 70s and 80s through September.While tourist favorites like Rome, Florence, Venice, and the Amalfi Coast often stay crowded into October, you will find fewer travelers throughout the country as the season goes on.Local food and wine festivals called sagres are everywhere in the fall. Celebrate your love of chocolate, wine, truffles, and chestnuts like a proper Italian. On your way, be sure to explore the countryside to take in the stunning fall colors in the vineyards starting in the middle of October going through November.Highlights: Food & Wine Winter in ItalyMonths: December – MarchCrowds are at a minimum in the winter so you can explore museums and galleries to your heart’s content. The theatre and opera season is in full swing so it’s really the peak time of year to take in Italian culture.Beginning the first week of December, you can also start shopping Christmas markets around the country. In the mood for a ski getaway? Unlike France and Switzerland, Italy is known for its chill ski resorts. While a serious competitive attitude prevails at many Europeans ski resorts, places like Cortina d’Ampezzo, Madonna di Campiglio, and Cervinia are perfect for skiers who are looking for a little fun in the snow.Highlights: Christmas Markets & Skiing Spring in ItalyMonths: April – MayItaly is at its vibrant best during the spring. With flowers coming into bloom, every stall and street corner is filled with gorgeous displays. You can beat the summer rush of tourists while enjoying all the colors and sunshine of April and May.And have I mentioned how much I love Italian food? The cuisine is very seasonal here so even if you were just at the fall food fests, you can eat your way through the country once again in the spring. Go pick wild strawberries in the hills outside Rome then travel to the countryside to sample this season’s grapes.Highlights: Grapes!Anywhere, anytime in Italy, you can feel this sense of timelessness that will make you feel like you never want to leave!Want to get the most out of your trip? I love the many tours Take Walks has around Italy! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/5-romantic-places-couples-florence/,5 Romantic Places for Couples in Florence,Italy,"We are willing to bet that if you and your partner haven’t visited Italy together, an Italian trip is probably pretty high on your list. Italy, and more specifically Florence, is our second home.We have had many romantic dates and adventures around the city, so we thought we would share our favorite romantic places.Here are the tops romantic places for couples in Florence!Giardini BoboliThe Boboli Gardens is essentially a beautiful outdoor museum but is considered a garden. It is filled with sculptures, beautiful Tuscan trees and native flowers, and even offers an awesome view of the city.Walking through the gardens is extremely romantic and can be relaxing if you’re looking to just sit and take a load off.Head here to enjoy some beautiful views with your partner.Piazzale MichelangeloPiazzale Michelangelo is arguably the most popular and most beautiful view of Florence.This is the perfect spot to watch the sunset, drink some wine, and even have a picnic. Do realize there will likely be a crowd; especially in high season. Sunset or sunrise is our favorite time to visit.Bridges over Arno RiverThere are a number of bridges that stretch over the Arno River aside from the Ponte Vecchio. These bridges are perfect for picnics, great photo opportunities, and even a spot to eat dinner.One of our favorite date nights was grabbing a take away pizza and a bottle of wine and taking it to the bridge for sunset.Top of the Duomo or Giotto’s CampanileIf you climb to the top of the Duomo you’re sure to have an incredible view. As you walk around the top, you can enjoy a 360-degree view of Florence with your partner.The magnificence of the Duomo, Giotto’s Campanile, and the city as a whole can truly be taken in from this location. One piece of advice: if you’re claustrophobic this might not be for you. Many of the stair cases and corridors leading up to the Cupola are quite narrow.Likewise, the view from the top of the bell tower is possibly even more magnificent, because you get to see the same 360-degree view but also see the Duomo! The corridors for the bell tower aren’t nearly as bad, so the 414 steps don’t seem too challenging.You’ll also have a number of opportunities to stop, rest, and take in beautiful views of the city from different heights.Palazzo PittiDoesn’t every couple imagine being prince and princess or king and queen? Walking through the palace and seeing where the royal families used to live is an awesome experience!The convenient thing is that you can knock this out with the Boboli Gardens as the gardens are essentially the back yard of the Pitti Palace.Find more Florence travel tips from Couple’s Coordinates blog! "

Less crowds mean you can see more and have more privacy during your adventures!If you have an airline credit card or a travel credit card, take advantage of the miles you receive as a signing bonus! Typically, you can apply them and make it to Rome or Milan for free strategically. From these central cities you can take the train anywhere in Italy.Get an AirbnbBecause as a couple you’ll not only pay more for a private hostel but you’ll also be in a hostel – which is really only great if you’re 19 and drunk. Having an Airbnb allows you and your significant over to feel at home, almost like a local, in Italy and is super romantic.  In contrast to hotels you’re also going to save a ton of money!Rent BikesYou’ll find bikes in Italy for as cheap as a few Euros a day.  Take advantage of this and take your significant other on a romantic bike ride as you explore a new city!Pizza, Panini, e VinniThe best pizza we have ever had was about €7 and the best panini we have ever had was about €5. We could literally eat either for any meal, any day.  So, take advantage of this. Grab €10 bottle of wine and enjoy a panini in a park.  Unlike most cheaper wines, a €10 wine in Italy is usually very good!Make a PicnicWe learned really quickly that you don’t need to spend a ton of money to have a romantic date. Buy a bottle of wine, some cheese, prosciutto and gelato (dessert doesn’t have to be last!) and sit over the river in Florence or find a park.Maybe you’re visiting a coastal town?  Take your picnic to the beach!Visit Local Farmers’ MarketsFarmers’ markets are the best places to find awesome fresh local food that is super inexpensive. You can find everything from produce to meats, cheeses, wines, and even souvenirs and trinkets.  Of course sometimes we want to go out to eat, but the alternative of making meals or getting picnic supplies from a local Farmers’ market is a great way to save money.Eat and Drink RegionallyIf you’re in Tuscany, eat and drink Tuscan cuisine.  Don’t look for a good ol’ bottle of whiskey or American dishes.  Enjoy the culture and experience new things regardless of where you are, and save money in doing so! "

As a solo female traveler, whether you are visiting to enjoy the excellent food or to see the sights of the city, you won’t leave without some memories and photos to treasure.Here’s my solo female traveler’s guide to Rome! Where to Stay in RomeRome is so popular that the sheer number of hotels is enough to make your head spin. There is no “best” district to stay in—where you stay should depend mostly on your preference and style of travel.Termini Station, as the main transport hub, wins in terms of diversity—here you can find hostels and pensions galore, and the proximity to trains and buses can’t be beat, but you will be on the outskirts of a lot of the sights and Vatican city area.If you’re looking for a comfortable, budget option you may want to stick with bed & breakfasts; there are a few awesome choices in the center of town. Also, you can find hostels and Airbnbs on every corner!If you’re on the lookout for a luxury hotel experience during your stay, try the Via Veneto district near Villa Borghese. Here you’ll find Rome’s most expensive and exclusive hotels— but, you can’t go wrong with beautiful gardens outside of your front door.If you’re after the Vatican, look no farther than the Prati hotel district, a quiet residential area just a few minutes’ walk to the Holy City.Check out all my Rome “where to stay” recommendations in the Ultimate Rome Travel Guide! What to See in RomeRome is THE destination when it comes to food, romance, history, and culture. I’ve touched on my favorite sights and must-dos in my three-day Rome itinerary, but when in Rome… don’t forget to check out these highlights!Trajan’s Markets was the first “multilevel shopping mall” in the world. Here you can also walk along the Via Biberatica, the best-preserved ancient street in the city. Afterward, climb up Palatine Hill to check out the imperial palaces, extensive garden grounds, and ruins of villas.You’ll marvel at the exquisite architecture of the Pantheon, the only temple that survived the collapse of Rome relatively in one piece.The Colosseum is the universal icon of Rome, and you can join a tour to explore the interior. Nearby, check out the Arch of Constantine, which was built to commemorate Constantine’s victory at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in 312, and the Roman Forum.While you’re wandering the streets, stop by the Trevi Fountain and toss in a coin—legend has it that whoever tosses a coin in the fountain will return to the Eternal City someday. Grab some gelato and take a moment on the Spanish Steps to watch the people passing by.I highly recommend checking out a food and pizza making tour in Rome! Food in RomeA trip to Rome wouldn’t be complete without delving into its cuisine! Stop by a local market for some fresh produce and farmer goodies.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-do-in-rome-in-three-days/,What to Do in Rome in Three Days,Italy,"Updated: November 2019Rome is famous for being one of the most historical, cultured and romantic destinations in the world, and whether you are visiting to enjoy the excellent food or to see the sights of the city, you won’t leave disappointed!Here are my tips on what to do in Rome in three days!Day 1 in RomeTake a TourWhile visiting Rome last summer, I joined a Rome food & pizza making tour, which, if you ask me, is the best way to discover a city! The tour lasts through mid-day, taking you through different parts of Rome. You’ll get your bearings of the city while trying the delicious food!You get to go to a market, a local bakery, a traditional pizzeria (where you can make a delicious masterpiece), and of course, end with a traditional Italian coffee break.Visit the Roman ForumMake your way to the Imperial Forums, especially Trajan’s markets which is the first “multi-level shopping mall” in the world. You can also explore the Via Biberatica, which is the most intact ancient Roman street in the city.Wander over the Roman Forum and take in the iconic views!Climb up on Palantine HillAfter exploring the forum, and wandering the streets that Julius Caesar once did, climb up to see the ruins of the imperial palaces on the Palatine Hill. Enjoy the beautiful garden areas and fragments of ancient villas.Visit the ColosseumTake the southeast entrance from the Roman Forum, and walk right up to the Colosseum. It is such an amazing sight to see, and if you are really interested in exploring the inside, join a tour. The tours can be expensive and have quite a bit of a wait, so decide if it is something that is really important to you!Next to the Colosseum is the Arch of Constantine, one of the largest of Rome’s ancient triumphal arches. The arch celebrates Emperor Constantine the Great’s victory and the battle that made Christianity the religion of Rome.Watch the Sunset from Piazza del CampidoglioMake sure that before sunset you slip around the backside of the central building in Piazza del Campidoglio, on top of Capitoline Hill. You’ll see a beautiful panorama of the Forum from above, with the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum in the background.Day 2 in RomeHave a Cappuccino at Caffé Sant’EustachioOne of the oldest and most famous cappuccino and espresso shops in Rome, Caffé Sant’Eustachio is famous for its home-roast beans, blended with water from an ancient aqueduct. You will find authentic, Italian coffee and some colorful characters!Visit the PantheonDefinitely a sight you CANNOT miss in Rome, the Pantheon is the only ancient Roman temple to survive the millennia virtually intact. The architecture will blow your mind, and you will need a few minutes just to sit in the piazza and take in the stately sight before heading inside.Go to Piazza del PopoloMake your way north to Piazza del Popolo, and if it interests you, check out the fabulous church of Santa Maria del Popolo.Explore Villa BorgheseAdjacent to the Piazza del Popolo, you’ll find the grounds of Villa Borghese. Stop at the east end for great views over the city and epic photo opportunities.Sit on the Spanish StepsYou can sit and people watch from the lively and iconic Spanish Steps before grabbing some gelato and taking a walk down Via dei Condotti and the surrounding streets to do a little window shopping.Toss a Coin in the Trevi FountainNo trip to Rome would be complete without seeing the Trevi Fountain! The tradition is to toss a few coins in, to ensure that one day you’ll return to the Eternal City. NOTE: As with all things ancient, the Trevi Fountain requires constant renovation and is drained to get some extra TLC right now.Read More:5 Romantic Places for Couples in RomeThe Solo Female Traveler's Guide to RomeRome Food Tour & Pizza Making With Walks of Italy    Day 3 in RomeExperience Vatican CityWake up bright and early so that you beat the tour buses to the spectacular, St. Peter’s Basilica, which opens at 7 am. If you are interested, following the basilica, climb the “cupola” for a workout and breathtaking panoramic views of the city across the river.Once you’re finished, spend some time in St. Peter’s Square out front, and visit the world-famous Vatican Museums, which open at 9 am, if you want to check out history at its finest. You can expect to spend most of the day at the Vatican if you’re a history lover!Visit Piazza NavonaBack across the river, and home to Bernini fountains, cafés, colorful street performers, and large crowds, Rome’s famous Piazza Navona is a lively place to people watch and enjoy your daily gelato.Get LostAs with all first-time visits to a city, allow lots of free time to get lost and discover unsuspected treasures around Rome. Keep a map handy, but try walking around without a plan or destination. You never know what you’ll find!I also highly recommend exploring the city at night. There are countless evening walking tours if you are traveling solo and want a guide, but there’s no city quite like Rome lit up at night!

https://theblondeabroad.com/top-romantic-getaways-in-italy-for-couples/,Top Romantic Getaways in Italy for Couples,Italy,"Back in June we quit our jobs and boarded a one-way flight to Italy.  For the last 4 months we have called Italy our home as we have leveraged Florence as our home base to travel throughout Europe! As you can probably expect, we have had our fair share of romantic Italian getaways.Here is our list of romantic getaways in Italy for couples!FlorenceIt would be hard to visit the city that birthed the Renaissance without feeling a bit of magic and romance in the air. Florence has it all! From the natural beauty of the surrounding hills and the Arno River to the man-made beauty seen in the Renaissance art and architecture, you’ll be in constant awe of what your eyes are seeing.Florence is also home to hundreds of restaurants that make for some of the best dinner dates you could ever dream of. Be sure to check out some of our favorites: Acqua al 2, Il Latini, and Gusta Pizza!Read More: 5 Romantic Places for Couples in FlorenceMonterosso al MareCommonly known as the last town in Cinque Terre (as it is the northernmost town), Monterosso offers visitors a vastly different experience from the other 4 towns in Cinque Terre.Being the only town of the 5 with ample room to lay on the beach and relax with a glass of wine, Monterosso is a couple’s perfect paradise destination.  The town is also home to our favorite restaurant on the Ligurian Coast, Da Eraldo which is a bit of a hidden gem having only 5 tables in the entire place.The town seems almost to be a cliché of what one would have in mind about an Italian coastal town. The side streets have laundry hanging from clothes lines, there are a few local cats that interact with all of the visitors, and the wine is delivered to the restaurants by bicycle on a daily basis!PositanoPositano is the spectacle of the Amalfi Coast and is arguably the most picturesque and most romantic city in the whole of Italy.We tend to have three simple standards by which we decide upon the favorability of locations we visit: aesthetic beauty, food, and people.  Positano hits the trifecta on this scale.The natural beauty of the town is not only physical but also metaphorical as the locals are incredibly hospitable and the food is Michelin Star worthy. Be sure to plan a date night at Da Vincenza. You can thank us later.LuccaLucca is the perfect day date or romantic weekend getaway wrapped up into a tiny castle town. Rent a bike with a basket, buy a bottle of wine, and take a romantic bike ride around the town.A benefit to Lucca is that it is commonly overlooked by travelers as most come to Italy to see Florence, Rome, Milan, and Venice.  So you’ll be able to enjoy one of the most romantic towns in Italy without the crowds you’ll encounter elsewhere.San GimignanoOk, let’s do everyone a favor and provide the phonetic spelling here.  Not to patronize anyone, but this one is a toughie.  San Gee-meen-nano.  Our first attempts at pronouncing it made it quite clear that we were new to town, so no shame if you read it a bit off in your head.San Gimignano is one of the most notable medieval towns in Italy, having preserved nearly a dozen of its medieval towers.  The town itself is quaint and surrounded by castle walls which separate the town from some of the most beautiful hills and vineyards one can find in Tuscany.And the wine!  Oh man, the wine.Italy is highly regarded for the production of red wine whether it is Chianti, Brunello, or another popular varietal.  However, San Gimignano produces Vernaccia di San Gimignano which is a white wine that has been considered to be one of the finest white wines of Italy for over 600 years.VeniceBarring crowds and inflated prices of food, Venice can be a very romantic trip for a couple.Gondola rides are of course the most clichéd romantic activity one can engage in on a trip to Italy but that doesn’t take away the fact that it’s quite magical to have a Venezian man row you around and sing to you while you travel Venice in the most traditional way.At night the romance truly comes alive as you’ll encounter live music while strolling through Piazza San Marco and enjoy the lights of Venice glistening on the canals.Read More: The Ultimate Venice Travel GuidePortofinoJust a short train ride north of Cinque Terre you’ll find the quaint fishing village of Portofino. These days, however, the harbor more so resembles the harbor of Monte Carlo than that of a fishing village.Bright, colorful, buildings encompass a small harbor that generally has 5 or more mega yachts anchored off at any one time, making the small fishing boats look like toys. Although, you’ll be sure to feel the local fishing culture as you enjoy some fresh seafood at one of the local restaurants.RiomaggioreIt was only proper that we included one more town from the Cinque Terre. Riomaggiore is the southernmost town in the Cinque Terre and is also probably the most overlooked town; making it great for a romantic trip with your better half.When you visit Cinque Terre, of course, be sure to see each of the 5 towns. Some of the most beautiful views come from Vernazza and Manarola, but the densest crowds and the highest concentration of selfie sticks can also be found in these towns.During the summer, the geographical location of Riomaggiore also gives it one advantage over the other 4 towns: you can see the sunset. So go grab yourself some take away calamari and enjoy the view!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-travel-italy-on-a-budget/,How to Travel Italy on a Budget,Italy,"Whether you are heading to Italy to enjoy the fabulous food, to enjoy its varied history or to make the most of the beautiful surroundings, there are plenty of things to do and to savor in the country.However, Italy isn’t the cheapest country to explore, and the costs can quickly mount up unless you keep a close eye on what you are spending and plan your trip to avoid excessive spending.Here are a few spending categories you can focus on to travel through Italy on a budget and have an amazing time!Plus, don’t miss my 10 Tips for Your First Trip to Italy before you go!Transportation in ItalyIf you’re flying to Italy, being flexible in terms of the time you travel and the route that you take can make a big difference to the cost of flights.  If you are traveling to Italy from other European destinations, check budget airlines along with train and bus routes to find the cheapest option.Getting around Italy is significantly easier than other European countries because of their extensive and state of the art train network. High-speed trains will be more expensive, around 40-70 EUR, but can get you to the other side of the country in just a few hours.For cheaper options, Italy’s regional trains are a great alternative and get you where you need to go!Getting around larger cities like Rome can be done by Metro or bus, although the Metro only has 2 lines so it’s not my suggested mode of transportation if you’re trying to a fit a bunch of sightseeing in a day. For cities like Florence and Venice, walking is easy and my preferred mode of transportation!Read More: Traveling Italy in a Week by TrainAccommodation in ItalyThere are some great budget accommodation options to be found around Italy, but even at the low-end, you are usually looking at around 25 EUR a night for a bed in a hostel dorm room up to 90 EUR for your own room.With the costs usually a fair bit higher in the big cities like Rome, Milan, and Venice, the option of booking accommodation in the suburbs of a town with good railway links to the city can often be cheaper than getting accommodation in the city center.Helpful Tip: Airbnb is a great option for budget travelers, as it tends to be cheaper than a lot of hotels and accommodations throughout Italy.READ NEXT: Using Airbnb For Apartment Rentals Around The WorldEating and DrinkingThe amazing cuisine is one of the main reasons that many people will visit Italy, but with a restaurant meal with a glass of wine costing 15 EUR or more, it is not an option every night if you are on a strict budget.Many restaurants charge a “coperta” fee or tax for sitting down in the restaurant that starts around 3 EUR, so it is always important to read the menu before sitting down to see what the charge will be.Many restaurants will try to draw people in during their lunchtime service with set menus, and if you can eat your main meal during lunch and then snack later in the day, this will undoubtedly help you to reduce your costs.There is always the option for quick meals or pizza by the slice, which makes a delicious dinner, and will only set you back about 3-5 EUR.Helpful Tip: Ask for tap water with your meals, or you will end up getting charged for bottled water. Some restaurants also charge for bread, so it is quite alright to pass on it to save yourself from being charged at the end of the meal.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Eating Like a Local in ItalyBudget ActivitiesWhen you are exploring cities, there are plenty of activities to do, with areas such as the Spanish Steps in Rome drawing local street performers and musicians, while many museums have days where the admission fees are waived. Here are some budget activities you can enjoy:Walking tours are a great way to get your bearings when you arrive in a new city, and give you an idea of the main sights you want to go back to. Most hostels in big cities offer walking tours daily that are usually free with a recommended tip for your guide at the end.Plan your trip to fall during a festival like the Venice Carnival in February or the Rome Christmas market.Check out which museums in a city interest you, and check to see if they have a specific day of the week or period where they offer free admission.Renting a bike can typically cost around 15 EUR a day but allows you to see more of the city or outdoors area than you could be walking!If you are going to be exploring the coastal regions, like Cinque Terre, hiking is an excellent way to see the beautiful scenery and not spend a dime.Sit and relax in the Villa Borghese park in Rome or the Piazzale Michelangelo in Florence (the best overlook of the city), and bring a picnic if you like!Visit churches and basilicas to experience the long history and culture of the Italian people. Most have free entrance, like St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice, and are just breathtaking.Read More: The Ultimate Italy Travel GuideDo you have any budget travel tips for Italy?

https://theblondeabroad.com/traveling-italy-in-a-week-by-train/,Traveling Italy By Train in a Week,Italy,"Updated: December 2019As a nation that was once made of smaller states and kingdoms, Italy is a country that has some very strong regional identities, which range from the traditionally wealthy northern cities down to poorer regions in the south.Italy is one of the most visited countries in Europe because of the range of destinations and unique experiences you can have within its borders. To get a taste of what the different regions of Italy have to offer, and experience true Italian culture, there are many destinations to explore!There are a ton of destinations for a week in Italy, so if you have a week to spend in Italy, you are bound to find some places that fascinate you and inspire you to want to explore, and here are a few suggestions to inspire your Italian trip.Here are my tips for traveling Italy by train in a week!  Traveling Around Italy by TrainItaly is a vast country, but also very accessible with many modes of transportation. One of the easiest ways to get around, and connect all these destinations if your itinerary allows, is to travel by train.Europe has an extensive and travel-friendly train system, and you can purchase a rail pass that allows you to make reservations on regional and high-speed trains to travel through Italy. The best way to book your train tickets is to purchase a rail pass.With a rail pass, you still have to make reservations on most train trips because they fill up, but tickets come at a substantially discounted price most of the time if you have a rail pass.Helpful Tip: If you plan on taking more than 2-3 trips, it will save you money on your journey, but you will need to purchase your rail pass online before your trip!Read More:The Beginner's Guide to Train Travel in Europe Italy by Train ItineraryIt is always best to map out your trip and see what the most logical route would be to connect your destinations.I’ve compiled the most popular (and my favorite) destinations in Italy, and while it is possible to visit all in a week, I would suggest picking 2 or 3 cities that interest you the most and spend more time in each destination.NOTE: This is just a sample itinerary. You can always do this route from north to south OR south to north!    Start in VeniceVenice (Mestre) to Florence (S.M.N Station)Travel Time: Approx 2 Hours on High-Speed TrainFlorence (S.M.N.) to Rome (Termini)Travel Time: Approx 1 1/2 Hours on High-Speed TrainRome (Termini) to Pompeii (Villa dei Misteri)This trip actually requires two different trains- the first leg is taking a high-speed train out of Rome to Naples (Napoli Centrale station). The second train leaves from Napoli Centrale (underground platforms of Circumvesuviana commuter rail) to Pompei.Travel Time: Approx 2 1/2 Hours with Waiting TimePompeii (Villa dei Misteri) to the Amalfi Coast (Sorrento)The most common train to the Amalfi Coast is by the local Circumvesuviana commuter line (slower) train into Sorrento.Travel Time: Approx 50 Minutes on Local TrainEnd in the Amalfi Coast Explore the Canals of VeniceVenice is located in northern Italy on the Adriatic coast, and is one of the most iconic cities in the world, with amazing canals that link the series of islands on which the city is built.The Basilica di San Marco and the Doge’s Palace are among the most remarkable sights to enjoy in the city, and you can also visit the excellent museums in Venice if Italian architecture and history interest you.Helpful Tip: While being rowed by a singing gondolier may be prohibitively expensive these days, you can purchase a daily travel card for the water buses to explore the islands.Walk the Streets of FlorenceFlorence is a beautiful city, full of Renaissance architecture, art and history, and romantic cobblestone streets. As the capital of the Tuscany region, you can find amazing food and wine, along with world-class museums.The iconic sights of Florence are the stately Ponte Vecchio bridge and the towering Florence Duomo. If you have time to wander across the Arno River, you can get a beautiful overlook of the city from Piazzale Michelangelo!Spend a Day in RomeThis capital city one of the great cities of Europe both today and historically. Rome is home to the Vatican, the spiritual center of the Catholic faith, and a range of historic buildings dating from Ancient Rome.The city is a beautiful place to explore, with attractive places to relax such as the square facing the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.It is also worth exploring the cuisine of the city, and if you can get off the tourist trail into some of the local food markets, you will find some real delicacies that are truly delicious.Explore Pompeii and VesuviusThe town of Pompeii was once one of the most prosperous in the country, until a catastrophic eruption in 79AD from the nearby volcano of Vesuvius covered the town in a thick layer of ash, killing thousands, but preserving the city.When the town was discovered, and the hardened ash was removed, the town was still in impressive condition, and if you visit the area today, you can get a deep understanding of the way of life and city as it was.It is also possible to hike to the top of Vesuvius today, as it is relatively stable and hasn’t erupted in decades. Naples is also a short train ride away if you are interested in having some of Italy’s BEST pizza!Enjoy a Ride Down the Amalfi CoastThis stretch of the Italian coast is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful in the world and is one of the top summer tourist destinations in Italy.If you take the train into Sorrento, you also have the option to take a day trip by car or tour bus. It is an amazing drive and worth hitting the coastline to spend a day in Positano!Check Italy train times and prices here! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/rome-food-tour-pizza-making-with-walks-of-italy/,Rome Food Tour & Pizza Making with Walks of Italy,Italy,"Updated: September 2019Rome is synonymous with many things, including a rich history, ancient Roman architecture, fast-moving traffic and, of course, amazing food.While visiting Rome, I joined Walks of Italy for a Rome food tour & pizza making class, which, if you ask me, is the best way to discover a city…by tasting all the food!Wondering what it’s like to join a food tour? Let’s roam around Rome!     Campo de’ Fiori MarketWe began our day at the Campo de’ Fiori Market, a colorful meeting of vendors selling everything from olive oil to fruit to Limoncello.A trip to Rome wouldn’t be complete without visiting a local market, but having a guide made the experience even sweeter. We chatted up the vendors who shared their passion for their goods.We sampled a variety of olive oils and balsamic vinegars (including a life-changing truffle infused balsamic reduction) and learned about where they are produced throughout Italy.Then, we made our way to a Limoncello vendor where we sampled different flavors of the sweet concoction. I had no idea it was available in flavors other than lemon and fell in love with pistachio cream.It tasted like a cocktail made from melted pistachio gelato! YUM!All the Meat, Cheese, and Bread!The next few stops on our tour led us to meat, cheese and bread shops that showcased traditional Italian specialties.First, we stopped at a local butcher where we sipped on wine while learning about the different types of meats that are typical in Italy. I don’t eat meat, but I think it’s safe to assume things were delicious based on the group’s “mmm’s and yum’s!”Our next stop was a cheese shop with every type of cheese imaginable! This was like a personal heaven to me. We nibbled on countless types of cheese and, of course, there was more wine!We rounded out our appetites at a local bakery where we shared different types of sweet and savory bites. Mamma Mia, It’s a Pizza!My belly was already feeling full as we made our way through Rome heading to the part of the tour I was most looking forward to! Luckily, they don’t call it “Walks” of Italy for nothing as the informational walk helped me gain my second wind.We arrived at a traditional Roman pizzeria where we were going to make our own Napoli-style pizza. The wood-burning stove created a cozy atmosphere and the smell of fresh-baked pizza had my tummy grumbling once again.I had SO much fun stretching the dough and topping my pizza with fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, and arugula!   Last Stop: CoffeeOur final stop on the food tour was Sant’Eustachio II Caffè, a cafe established in the 1930s that serves up some of the best coffee in Rome.A cappuccino was the perfect end to a food-filled experience around Rome!We learned all about coffee culture in Italy, the *right* way to drink an espresso and even why Italians typically don’t drink milky coffees after 11 am.OverallI had an absolutely amazing time on my Walks of Italy tour and encourage anyone visiting Rome to take one of the tours and eat their way through the city. It’s such a good way to get a *taste* for the local culture. 😉Book your food tour in Rome here! Mangia bene!Wondering what food culture is like in Italy before you go?

https://theblondeabroad.com/discovering-pompeii-and-the-amalfi-coast-with-walks-of-italy/,Discovering Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast with Walks of Italy,Italy,"I awoke in the early morning to the hustle and bustle of Rome. It was my second time traveling to the ancient city and just as magical as the first time I laid my eyes on her cobblestone streets.As I sipped on my cappuccino, my feet tapped anxiously in anticipation for the exciting day ahead. I would be joining Walks of Italy with my friend Michael, of Go, See, Write, on my first ever trip down the Amalfi Coast to visit the town of Positano and the ruins of ancient Pompeii. PositanoWe began our day driving from Rome to the seaside town of Positano. Our journey led us down the gorgeous Amalfi Coast famous for her crystal blue coastline.We made a few stops along the way to take in the scenery where I encountered views that took my breath away.Our arrival into Positano made for some hilarious 10-point turns as our bus squeezed its way through narrow, winding streets. Because of the seaside location of Positano, the rest of our journey to town would be by foot.My eyes were wide as we passed shop after shop of boutiques overflowing with gorgeous white linen clothing.Positano is well-known for their artisan clothing and leather sandals. As a girl who is obsessed with Boho style, it was basically like walking through a Free People catalogue.On the beach. And with everything 60% off.I met with a sandal craftsman to inquire about having some beautiful leather sandals made and went into boutique after boutique running my hands over the delicate fabrics with colorful hand-embroidery.Retail heaven didn’t stop there though. On our final stretch towards the beach, jewelers lined the walkway selling beautiful jewelry with stones and corals indigenous to the area.I was so mesmerized by the beautiful pieces I nearly had to be dragged away!Our Walks of Italy guide led us down to our final stop, the beach, where pastel buildings in pinks and yellows spotted the cliffs. It was absolutely stunning!Read More: Tips for Visiting the Amalfi Coast in ItalyWe had some free time to relax on the beach and enjoy lunch at one of the beachside restaurants. I decided on Ristorante Chez Black, a local institution opened in the 1940s, featuring nautical decor and delicious seafood. I’ve always felt that I was mermaid in a past life and this restaurant made me feel right at home.We enjoyed perfectly grilled squid and a delicious octopus salad.Before returning to our bus to continue our journey on to Pompeii, there was one last essential stop in Positano. We made our way back up from the beach (my eyes closed to avoid any more shopping) to the town’s limoncello stand.The sweet & sour chill of the limoncello was the perfect ending to my sun-kissed afternoon in Positano.PompeiiOur journey continued on to the ruins of Pompeii. I had always dreamed of visiting Pompeii ever since I was a little girl.I remember learning about the ancient city in grade school and being fascinated by the history and secrets of the events that happened there nearly 2,000 years ago.When my feet first touched the streets of Pompeii, it was like being transported back in time. Our guide led us on an in-depth exploration of the site that was buried by ash from the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius (which is considered one of the most dangerous volcanos in the world to this day).To avoid rambling off on too much of a history lesson, I’ll share some interesting facts about Pompeii:The people in Pompeii and Herculaneum were taken by complete surprise when the volcano erupted. However, the signs were there in the form of a series of earthquakes. In 63 AD, a massive earthquake shook the region, and damage from the earthquake was still being repaired when Mt. Vesuvius erupted 16 years later. (source)The site was lost for about 1,500 years until its initial rediscovery in 1599 and broader rediscovery almost 150 years later by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre in 1748. (source)The objects that lay beneath the city have been well-preserved for centuries because of the lack of air and moisture. These artifacts provide an extraordinarily detailed insight into life during ancient Rome. (source)I was surprised to learn that Pompeii had multiple brothels and that the city was covered in erotic art and objects. Apparently ancient Rome was much more liberal than present-day!Our Walks of Italy tour guided us through ancient Pompeii where we walked through ruins of baths, homes and shops. It was absolutely fascinating to see how well-preserved everything is!We wrapped up our day just before sunset and, while the bus returned the rest of the tour group back to Rome, I stayed behind to take a train to nearby Naples.I had an absolutely amazing time on my Walks of Italy tour and encourage anyone spending time in Italy to book a tour to visit Pompeii and the Amalfi Coast!More InformationTour: Amalfi Coast & PompeiiCompany: Walks of ItalyCost: 216 USD/personSpecial thanks to Walks of Italy for having me as a guest on their tour. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/shipwrecked-in-sardinia/,Shipwrecked in Sardinia,Italy,"It had been a perfect week of sailing the gorgeous glass-surfaced waters of the Mediterranean; between the French island of Corsica and the Italian island of Sardinia. The last possible thing I could have imagined was an end to our trip…by shipwreck.[youtube id=”http://youtu.be/qIjhtIN5Cys” width=”669″ height=”375″]It was the second to last day of our sailing trip and our entire crew was excited to spend some time on the mainland exploring the cultural bits of Sardinia. We anchored in a small bay off the coast of Palau- a popular port destination. The weather was cloudless, hot, and sticky with humidity.We had organized that evenings dinner at a family-owned farm and restaurant, Lu Branu, and made plans to spend the following day exploring the regional wineries. Dinner that night was a feast of traditional Sardinian deliciousness; pastas, cured meats, suckling pig, regional cheeses and bottomless vino rosso.Life was good.After a four hour-or-so dining experience, we caught a ride back to port and returned to our boat. We found a note from a stranger that initially caused no alarm, but after attempting to start the engines (unsuccessfully) and watching dark clouds loom over us, the fear sunk in.“Hi, I had to move your boat as she had dragged her anchor and was in danger of being hit by the ferry! Sorry if she’s a bit further out. Please check your anchor again to be sure you get a good nights sleep. Hope all’s well.”We soon realized that, while the kind act of this stranger saved our boat from death-by-ferry, our troubles were far from over. While attempting to save our boat, they had accidentally sucked a stray rope into the starboard prop. Since the engine wouldn’t start, we also established that they blew the starter engine trying to repeatedly turn on the boat with the prop tangled.No engine = No anchor powerWe continued to try and start the engine, but with no luck. And because our starboard engine was out, we had no power to lift or let out the anchor. Our anchor was stuck, yet not let far enough out to hold the boat. The rain had begun to pour down heavily, wind thrashed at our boat, thunder boomed in the night sky and lightening lit the entire horizon.The boys hopped in our dinghy and arrived at the nearest sailboat to get help. A smaller, single prop sailboat came to our rescue! We tied our boats together and the sailboat began to tow us to safety. As soon as a glimmer of hope had appeared, it was washed away with the worsening of our storm. If the sailboat continued to tow us, it would capsize and we would both be, well, screwed.They cut their rope and we were on our own.Our catamaran was quickly being swept directly into the massive rocks that lined the bay and there was nothing to do but wait until we hit. Just moments later, the deafening crash of the cat against the rocks made my stomach sink and panic immediately ensued.While we wouldn’t be stranded on a Komodo Dragon infested island like fellow travel blogger, Kate, had been in Indonesia, her frightening story of jumping overboard from a sinking ship immediately came to mind.I ran to pack all of our belongings into waterproof bags and prepared to abandon ship. My Swedish friend onboard came to me, grabbed my shoulders, and said, “Now is not the time to panic. We are in no danger. We are fighting to save this boat. You panic when I panic. Now go to the front and help.”Perhaps, I was a bit overdramatic.She was right, though. Regardless of whether we were in danger ourselves, if we didn’t save this $1M yacht, someone would have our necks.I got to the front net of the catamaran just as the Italian Coast Guard arrived. Only problem, nobody on their boat spoke English and none of us spoke Italian. They shouted two questions in English, “Are you taking on water?” and “Is anyone overboard or injured?” Our answer was, “no.” They turned their boat around and sailed off into the distance.Strike 2. Still no help.When things felt like they couldn’t possibly get worse, out of nowhere, a stealthily disguised black hybrid of dinghy and speedboat pulled up to our catamaran. I barely made out the silhouette of the boat before about 5 Italian men, dressed in full black wetsuits (that may as well have been tuxedos), masterfully 007’d their way onto our boat. With cigarettes resting on their lips, they effortlessly overtook our ship and very cool-calm-and-collectedly began a plan to save us.It was a real life James Bond moment that will forever remain emblazoned in my memory.Our new Italian secret agents began sawing off our anchor. While this is obviously a solution to part of our problem, our captain wasn’t too keen on letting a $5k essential boat part sink to the bottom of the ocean. But, it had to be done.Bye bye anchor.We were now dealing with an anchor-less and starboard engine-less catamaran. *Awesome* The plan? To crank the port side engine and get us to safety. With only our left engine working, our cat would, no doubt, veer right as we attempted to sail straight. So, the Italian secret agents rammed their boat against the starboard side of our boat to keep us on course.After nearly 30 minutes of sailing, and at about 4 am, we arrived at an unfamiliar port. We would be staying at a Naval base on the nearby island of La Maddalena. Our boat was safely and securely tied up to the dock as our new Italian friends reassured us they we would be back in the morning to help us assess the damage to the boat.I fell asleep that night (or I suppose in this case early morning) with the sound of hail tapping above my cabin. I hoped to wake up and realize the whole thing had been a dream. At least, for a few hours, I could rest easy knowing that it was all over.And we were safe."
https://theblondeabroad.com/im-going-sailing-in-sardinia/,I’m Going Sailing in Sardinia!,Italy,"So after a two month stint back home in California, it’s time to return to my “being abroad” business. This upcoming trip involves ALL of my favorite things:bikinis, sunshine, sailing, culture and food!While I’ve visited the ancient cities of Rome, Florence and Pisa, I’ve longed to visit the incredible Mediterranean coast of Italy. I’ll be joining some South African friends that I met on The Yacht Week Croatia for a week long sailing trip around the island of Sardinia. Our crew will also be completed with some new friends from Sweden and the UK. We will be sailing to the pristine beaches around Sardinia and exploring the best food and sightseeing of the island.A little about Sardinia…Sardinia is one of the most beautiful sailing destinations in the world and is a unique island destination. Sardinia may be an Italian island, but it actually lies closer to the North African coast. Even still, Sardinia is described as feeling un-Italian with its strong sense of independence, “lost between Europe and Africa and belonging to nowhere.” – D.H Lawrence.One of my favorite behind-the-scenes looks at Sardinia was in an Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations Sardinia episode where Anthony visits his wife’s homeland. Anthony takes viewers on a culinary tour of the family-focused island while indulging in typical Sardinian delights; like suckling pig and homemade ravioli. While Sardinia has its own unique culture separate from Italy, they both clearly share a common interest… FOOD!Eh, chi non m’as postu frucchitta!“Or, as a great-aunt said once, scolded during a Sunday lunch in Cagliari since she was not touching her typical Sardinia food, ‘Why? You didn’t give me the fork!’ Once you’re at the table in Sardinia, eating is a must!” –CharmingSardiniaPhoto Credit: MySardinia.comI have a vague idea of what to expect in Sardinia based on my research, but I am going to leave most of my experience open to surprise. From what I do know, I’ll be returning home with a full belly and a bronze bum; and that’s reason enough to be excited!What would be your #1 thing to do in Sardinia?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/diving-the-red-sea-in-aqaba-with-deep-blue-dive-center/,Diving the Red Sea in Aqaba with Deep Blue Dive Center,Jordan,"If you’ve been following my blog for a bit then you know how much I love scuba diving. I take any chance I can get to go on a dive and explore the world from underwater. During a recent trip to Jordan, I went for yet another dive with Deep Blue Dive Center.I would say that it was probably the best dive team of anywhere I’ve ever dived (and that’s saying a lot)!Mohammed and the guys at Deep Blue are fantastic and super fun to be around and they make you really comfortable—even if you are trying diving for the first time! You can book a one on one and they are super sensitive to people that are nervous.We work with Deep Blue as our dive partner for our TBA Escapes Jordan tours and we have done over 10 discovery dives with them as well as dives for certified divers. The team is just really that amazing and their boat is wonderful.So whether you are traveling solo or booking with a group there are options for everyone!  Aqaba - from the TBA Escapes Jordan ""Ancient Wonders Tour""Where to StayIf you decide to book a dive, you can stay in Aqaba. There are quite a few options for accommodations. Deep Blue is located at Tala Bay Resort in South Beach, Aqaba so if you prefer to stay nearby, I highly recommend looking in that area.If you don’t mind being further away, I recommend the Kempinski Hotel Aqaba, my favorite property in all of Jordan. It’s beautiful, right on the water, has easy beach access, and is very well run. Management and the service are top-notch. What to ExpectDeep Blue Dive Center is a PADI 5-star dive center which I always recommend when looking for different dive shops to dive at.Once onboard, a full day of diving with Deep Blue includes lunch (where they usually grill). The chef is amazing and the food is delicious.If you can, I would recommend booking boat dives rather than shore dives, even though shore dives are available. You save a lot of energy and time by booking boat dives and get a little extra fun day out at sea because of it!As for the diving, there are some really cool wreck dives in Aqaba. One thing to note is that you won’t see dolphins from the Red Sea in Jordan as that’s only in Israel. Rumor has it that nets are set up to prevent them from leaving, However, you will still be able to see hawksbill turtles, lionfish, blue-spotted rays, and more!Top Dive SitesThere are so many dive sites along the coast, but the Tank and the Wreck are two of the most iconic. The new Sunken Plane is on its way to becoming a top location, too. Altogether, there are about 20-25 different spots along the coast, giving you plenty of options to choose from.The TankThe Tank, one of Aqaba’s most famous dive sites. Sunk by the Jordanian Royal Ecological Diving Society in 1999, it only lies 6m below the surface. It’s home to lionfish, scorpionfish, and eels, and is the perfect dive spot for beginner and advanced divers alike!   The WreckThe Wreck aka Cedar Pine is the wreck of a Lebanese freighter that sunk in 1985. By the request of King Abdullah II, it became used as an artificial reef. The 74m long boat lies on its side 28m below the water’s surface and is home to a wide variety of marine life.The Sunken PlaneThe Sunken Plane, a C-130 known as Hercules, was sunk in 2017 to create yet another artificial reef. Sitting nearby the Tank, it only lies 18m underwater and is easily accessible to all divers. If you’re an experienced diver, you can dive throughout the plane as the doors have been removed.Underwater Military MuseumRecently, the first underwater military museum was created in Aqaba. It consists of 19 fascinating battle relics including tanks, an ambulance, a military crane, a troop carrier, a combat helicopter, and more. Depths of the objects range anywhere from 11m to 28m, allowing you to enjoy the site in multiple different ways.There are also plenty of other dive sites on the coast. This includes Power Station, First-Bay North and South, Eel Garden, Rainbow Reef, and New Canyon (just to name a few!).If you’re looking to get your PADI certification, you can do so while you’re out!Fun Fact: The King of Jordan, King Abdullah II is a master diver and has advocated for a lot of coral restoration and has requested that artificial reefs are created. This makes Aqaba one of the best places in the world to dive!  OverallIf you’re looking to go diving in Jordan, Aqaba is a must-visit spot. I highly recommend Deep Blue Dive Center!Wondering what it takes to get your PADI scuba diving certification?And don’t forget to check out my 10-Day Itinerary for Jordan!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-the-dead-sea-in-jordan/,Tips for Visiting the Dead Sea in Jordan,Jordan,"The more I visit Jordan, the more I fall in love. When I visit (and when most other folks visit) a trip to the Dead Sea is one of the top things…and for good reason!While the Dead Sea is often associated with Israel, it’s actually on the border of Israel and Jordan (Jordan to the East, Israel to the West).Did you know that it’s the lowest point of land on Earth at over 400 meters below sea level? Oh, and fun fact: it’s got over 30% salinity (that’s the salt to water ratio…about 10 times more salt than typical seawater!), because the water is so dense that’s what allows you to effortlessly float.Although I like to take my time, you really don’t need more than one night.So if you’re trying to fit a bunch of things into your Jordan itinerary—do not fret. Get to your accommodation mid-day and leave after breakfast the next morning and you’ll have had ample time to experience the Dead Sea.I’m not sure what kind of magic is in the mud, but if you’re wanting to discover the marvelous wonders of the Dead Sea for yourself, here are my tips for visiting!  Where to StayWhen I’ve visited, I’ve always stayed at the Movenpick, a really beautiful resort with a ton of pools and fantastic restaurants, along with private Dead Sea beach access.While I’m usually all for prioritizing boutique accommodations, Jordan really isn’t a destination that offers “design hotels.” You’ll often find resorts at the major tourist sites, but that’s just the way it is.Once you’ve arrived at your accommodation, check-in and grab lunch by the pool. If there’s nice weather, I highly recommend having a little lazy afternoon by the pool.An hour before sunset, head to the Dead Sea beach to maximize your experience.Tips for Soaking in the Dead SeaTypically the resorts only keep their pools and Dead Sea paths open while there are lifeguards on duty, so access to the Dead usually closes when the sun has set. This is what you’ll want to plan your visit around.This is why I recommend getting there an hour or so before sunset. Helpful Tip:During my first trip to the Dead Sea, I wore an all-black bikini and the mud didn’t completely wash out even after several soapy scrubs. So a word for the wise: don’t wear your favorite swimsuit!   Soaking TimeBecause the water is so salty, it’s incredibly dehydrating so you’ll only want to soak in the sea for a max 10-15 minutes. I know this might not seem like enough time…but believe me, it is!Cover Yourself in MudOnce you’ve soaked, get out and cover your body in the Dead Sea mud. Movenpick has a huge tub of this on the beach provided for you with mirrors and it’s quite fun to cover yourself with it and get really muddy! (I’m guessing most other hotels in the area will, too.)Relax + DryThen you sit on a little bench and let it dry for about 15-20 minutes (it doesn’t have to be completely dry). Most hotels will provide bottles of water as well so you’ll want to keep drinking as it is super dehydrating. This mud is famous for its detoxifying and therapeutic effects.It’s rich in magnesium, calcium, potassium, and iron. These vitamins help regulate heart rate, circulation, and cell communication. Plus it does wonders for your skin!  Rinse + SoakAfter the 15-20 minutes, go into the Dead Sea to float one last time and rinse the mud off. If you put the mud on your face DO NOT use the Dead Sea to wash it off—in general, avoid splashing around completely.The tiniest drop of water in your eyes will momentarily blind you as it is so salty. It’s one of the most painful things I’ve ever experienced.Usually, the lifeguard on duty will help you with water on hand to help you rinse your eye. But you really don’t want to get the Dead Sea in your face, so just float and don’t get it above your neck (my recommendation). Just a very relaxed and controlled float.Shower OffOnce you’re mostly clean, get out and go in the outdoor showers to fully wash off the mud and the Dead Sea salt. There’s usually a large bowl of Dead Sea salt available so you can scrub your whole body for one final exfoliation. Do this last as any sort of abrasions will sting! Then rinse off one final time and feel amazing.If you can time it around sunset it really is spectacular.A Note on Cuts/AbrasionsIf you have any cuts on your body you will feel it and it will likely sting. It won’t hurt you but just be aware! I had a blister on my foot and it hurt for about 30 seconds and then I stopped feeling any pain. The general overall feeling is a very dull uncomfortable sensation.The same thing goes for exfoliating. I would not recommend exfoliating (or shaving) your body before going in but do this after!  Kempinski Hotel Ishtar Dead SeaThe Morning AfterThe next day I would recommend watching the sunrise from one of the pools. There’s a really cool soup bowl-style pool on the Kempinski Ishtar property—spectacular for sunrise! And if you want to do one final dip in the Dead Sea before you head out, do so that morning.Typically the hotels don’t require you to check out until noon which I personally find quite lovely. You’ll have plenty of time for one final dip, especially if you get up for sunrise!Movenpick (and I’m guessing other hotels in the area) usually provides really lovely Dead Sea products in your room. So yes, there are TONS of Dead Sea hair products, lotions, and skin products for you to sample and take home.Your skin will feel amazing for like two days after—I don’t know the secrets or the magic contained in the mud, but it’s soooo good!TBA TakeawaysBe prepared for a slight sting if you have any cuts or abrasionsDon’t get any of the Dead Sea in your eyes/above your neckDrink lots of water—it’s very dehydrating!Follow the instructions on how long to floatDon’t wear your favorite bathing suitGo at sunset if possible!Explore More of JordanIf you are planning a full trip to Jordan and would like some recommendations for how to plan the trip, check out my 10-day Jordan itinerary!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/highlights-from-the-tba-escapes-jordan-ancient-wonders-tour/,Highlights from the TBA Escapes Jordan Ancient Wonders Tour,Jordan,"Over the years, I’ve gotten so many requests for local advice, travel tips and itineraries for my favorite destinations around the world. So, not long ago, I was inspired to invite you guys to come along on trips I designed!TBA Escapes was created to bring epic travel experiences, in some of the biggest bucket list destinations on Earth, to like-minded female travelers from around the world.Since starting my TBA Escapes all-female tours in South Africa in 2017, we have launched new tours around the world — the “Ancient Wonders Tour” in Jordan, a “Luxury Yacht Eco Expedition” in the Galápagos, and a Morocco “Adventure Tour”.While in Jordan, the focus was on capturing the beauty of the country and teaching the ladies more about photography!The itinerary was an epic adventure, to say the least. We ventured through the city of Amman (the first place in the Middle East I ever visited in 2012!), hiked up the Wadi Mujib river, took a “float” in the Dead Sea, experienced the beauty of ancient Rose City of Petra, went diving in the Red Sea, and explored the historic Roman ruins in Jerash.Ready to see the highlights from the TBA Escapes “Ancient Wonders Tour” in Jordan? Let’s look!Photography Tour, You Say?One of the highlights of this tour was our partnership with FUJIFILM USA!This partnership was a huge perk for the ladies and something that makes me so excited about running these tours. Because photo tours can get quite expensive when you get new gear, we organized the unique opportunity for each attendee to borrow my favorite Fujifilm X-Series camera and lenses, at no additional cost!Learn more about my favorite FUJIFILM camera gear here!      The City of AmmanAmman is where it all starts. The majority of international flights arrive here and it is the perfect place to start exploring Jordan.Amman is actually the first place in the Middle East that I visited (back in 2012), and it will always be a special city for me. On these trips, we wandered the stunning sites throughout the city, like the Roman Theatre, the Amman Citadel, and Rainbow Street — and made some memories!Shot on Fujifilm X-H1And the food! I mentioned in my guide to the top ten things to do in Amman that cooking classes are a must — so that’s exactly what we did. We crafted Arabic and Jordanian staples like hummus and fattoush and learned from a local woman that founded the Beit Sitti Cooking School (which means “my Grandmother’s house”). How cool!  Wadi Mujib    Canyoning in Wadi MujibWadi Mujib is another adventurous highlight of traveling in Jordan! The Wadi Mujib Biosphere Reserve is home to a 70km/44 mile-long sandstone canyon, cut out by the Mujib River. It is one the top must-sees in Jordan and you can “canyon” or hike a portion of it!We opted for an adventurous hike upstream through the river current, rocks, and waterfalls with the help of each other and lots of ropes (for safety, of course).It was a serious adrenaline thrill!   The Dead SeaThe Dead Sea is a huge bucket list item when visiting Jordan! It’s the saltiest sea on the planet AND the lowest point on Earth.After a little “float” in the Dead Sea, we covered ourselves in Dead Sea mud (which is supposed to be great for your skin!) and jumped in for one last sunset float. We were lucky to experience both a sunset and a sunrise float.It’s such a surreal feeling!    Shot on Fujifilm X-T3Wadi Rum + Bubble TentsMars, I mean, Wadi Rum was the ideal location for a guided adventure in 4×4’s — hello, dune safari! The dramatic sandstone mountains and caverns created once in a lifetime photo ops that we couldn’t resist.Wadi Rum is one of the most beautiful deserts I’ve seen throughout my travels — and the terrain is unlike anywhere else on Earth!On top of that, we got to go off-the-grid for the night and stay in some of the coolest “bubble tents,” EVER! Glamping and serious views of the stars? Yes, please!Another bonus about being in a place without light pollution from the city? We got to work on night photography with the gals and learned how to capture the stars on our Fujifilm cameras!   Petra    Shot on Fujifilm X-T3 The Rose City of PetraOne of the highlights of the trip was seeing the ancient city of Petra — and it is seriously a breathtaking experience!We got to experience the “Petra at Night”, where you are serenaded by the local Bedouin people, playing gorgeous music with traditional rababas.And, we hiked into Petra for a full day of exploring. We walked over 20,000 steps and spent about 6-7 hours inside the complex. It’s MASSIVE!Petra is called the Rose City and it is easy to see why — it’s a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the 7 New Wonders of the World. The city can date back to around 300 BC but wasn’t rediscovered until 1812. It’s truly a magnificent look back into ancient history.We explored the fascinating sandstone carvings at the iconic sites like the Royal Treasury, Amphitheatre, and Monastery.  Aqaba     Aqaba and  The Red SeaAfter a few days of drying out in the desert, a dip in the Red Sea is much needed! We stayed at a beautiful beach-side hotel in Aqaba — a port city that was founded way back in 4000 BCE, and let me tell you, it’s buzzing!We spent a full day on the water with Deep Blue Dive Center, a PADI 5-Star Dive Center, and chartered a private boat to explore for the day. Scuba diving is one of the highlights of any trip for me and the Red Sea is a truly epic dive spot with shipwrecks, a sunken plane, coral reefs, and even a sunken tank! The marine and coral life was SO beautiful.For those attendees who were scuba certified, we offered a two-tank dive, and for those who hadn’t tried scuba diving yet, we were able to offer Discovery Dives so they could try it for their first time! It was so magical for me to see the excitement these girls had after their first dive!It was a much-needed day of sun, saltwater, and relaxation!  Shot on Fujifilm X-T3   JerashRoman Ruins of JerashJerash is known for having the best-preserved Roman city outside of Rome itself! Thriving since the Bronze Age, the city of Jerash has a dynamic history.The ruins were truly remarkable and in amazing condition, so we wandered through the ruins for a few hours and learned lots of fun facts from a local guide. TBA Escapes Jordan “Ancient Wonders Tour” Testimonials“Epic trip of a lifetime! Thank you TBA Escapes for helping me fulfill my #1 Bucket List item, visiting Petra, Jordan. No words can even begin to describe how amazing this trip was…it exceeded all of my expectations! When I think back to the week spent with 15 amazing women exploring all corners of the beautiful country of Jordan, a permanent smile on my face forms and goosebumps begin to emerge. I can’t even begin to pick my favorite adventure…exploring Wadi Mujib, Jeeping throughout Wadi Rum, floating in the Dead Sea, hiking all over Petra, scuba diving the Red Sea…it all was incredible! Thank you to everyone who made this an epic journey I will forever cherish. Can’t wait for the next adventure!”– Raquel T. “This tour to Jordan with TBA Escapes was truly a unique, luxury experience. The food, the views, the hosts; everything was beyond my highest expectations. This is not just packaged tourism. It’s the perfect mix of sightseeing with a local touch. I never imagined myself traveling in the Middle East, but thanks to TBA Escapes my dreams became an amazing reality!”– Arianna B. “I had high hopes for my trip to Jordan with TBA Escapes, and I can honestly say the experience far exceeded my expectations. Every last detail, from arrival to departure, was arranged thoughtfully. I saw things I only dreamed about, like the Dead Sea, Petra and Wadi Rum, and made friendships with incredible women. Our guides, Kiersten herself, Lauren and Reine, were absolutely lovely and made the trip that much better. Jordan was a perfect introduction to traveling in the Middle East, and I’m looking forward to booking another tour with TBA Escapes in the future!”– Michelle C. “I’ve never been on a group tour before (usually I like to travel solo!), so was a bit anxious about joining a group. However, this experience was incredible. I’m so happy I went, Kiersten and the rest of the team continuously went out of their way to make sure everyone was comfortable and taken care of. I was also hesitant because this was advertised as a “photography” tour, that my expectations were unrealistic and set too high. (I wanted to get more comfortable using my camera). Luckily that wasn’t the case, Kiersten was an excellent teacher and I learned SO SO SO much. I walked away from the tour with camera knowledge, Lightroom knowledge, and new experiences that I probably wouldn’t have experienced on my own. I’m so grateful for TBA Escapes and the confidence it gave to me.”– Kylie N.

While some countries are much more strict with their cultural and social expectations, I always err on the side of caution and dress conservatively to avoid any unwanted attention or to cause offense.For the most part, countries that have a large Muslim, Hindu and/or Buddhist influence are the countries that you’ll need to cover up in. It’s important to respect local and religious traditions at all times, and you should be aware of your behavior to ensure it doesn’t offend local customs — and that begins with dressing modestly.Take time to think through your outfits and pack for your trip to a conservative country!It is considered a sign of respect to keep your knees and shoulders covered, and so I’d recommend making sure you have items in your suitcase to do just that. When visiting very conservative destination, you may need to go as far as to cover your arms (down to the hands), hair, and feet.Headscarves may not be required everywhere in a conservative country, but from my experience in Morocco, I found that whenever I received unwanted attention as a tourist, all I had to do was cover my head and nobody would bother me. My rule of thumb is to always have something I could drape around my shoulders and cover my legs with, in case it’s necessary while I’m out exploring.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for when you plan your own trip to a conservative country like Morocco, Jordan, Turkey, Dubai, Indonesia, and more!What to Pack for Trip to a Conservative Country !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

https://theblondeabroad.com/homemade-hummus/,Homemade Hummus,Jordan,"This is a guest post by Amy Pamensky, Nutritionist, Natural Chef and founder of Nourished Balance. She is one of my favorite food bloggers and it’s an honor to have her share her recipe for one of my go-to dips!Hummus is one of my favorite spreads and dips. You can buy a tub of hummus at any grocery store. However, I much prefer the flavor of homemade hummus. Since it takes less than 5 minutes to make and it costs less money to make it yourself, I think that it is well worth the effort.[youtube id=”PptcjWxBoDM” width=”70%” height=”40%”]There are 2 reasons why homemade hummus is better than store bought hummus.All about the flavor! Any chef will tell you that the freshness of the ingredients used in a recipe has a drastic affect on the flavor in a finished dish. Using fresh lemon, a good quality olive oil and sea salt will make the world of difference when it comes to flavor.Clean ingredients! A lot of store-bought hummus contains additional ingredients to make the hummus last longer and to cut the cost of production. There is no need to cut corners on this delicious dip/spread. The poor-quality added ingredients turn a healthy snack into a not-so-healthy option. “While traveling through Jordan, I was served hummus at just about every meal- even breakfast! There’s nothing like fresh, homemade hummus!”-Kiersten, The Blonde AbroadBelow you will find a basic hummus recipe with a few mild spices. You can always change things up by adding some additional ingredients such as roasted red peppers, roasted garlic, roasted eggplant, etc.Let’s get to the RECIPE!Ingredients1 16 oz can of chickpea/garbanzo beans1/4 cup liquid from can of beans3-5 tablespoons of lemon juice*1 1/2 tablespoons of tahini**1 clove of garlic, crushed (optional)1/2 tsp sea salt1/8 tsp cumin1/8 tsp cayenne (optional- can add more if you LOVE spice)2 tablespoons olive oilDirectionsDrain beans of choice and set liquid asideAdd remainder of ingredients to a blenderMeasure out 1/4 cup of liquid from beans and add to blenderBlend until smooth (If needed for texture, add 1 extra teaspoon of olive oil)* Lemons vary in size and bitterness. Start with 3 Tablespoons then add more if needed for taste** Tahini is a creamy puree of roasted sesame seeds. You can use it for a creamy salad dressing.This hummus will last for 1 week if refrigerated in an air-tight container.Dig in with some delicious crunchy vegetables (carrots, celery, peppers etc.) for a fresh snack. Or, spread this hummus on a whole wheat tortilla with your desired toppings for a lunch option.Amy Pamensky is the founder of Nourished Balance.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ten-things-to-do-in-amman-jordan/,"Ten Things to Do in Amman, Jordan",Jordan,"Admittedly, I had no idea what to expect on my first ever trip to the Middle East. Would it be safe traveling alone? Would I like it? After spending three weeks exploring the beautiful country of Jordan, it became one of my all-time favorite destinations. I was astounded by The Dead Sea, impressed by the underwater splendor in Aqaba and mesmerized by the magic of the desert stars in Wadi Rum.I began my journey through Jordan in the capital city of Amman. As part of a collaboration with the Tourism Board of Jordan, I would be filming YouTube videos of some of the featured 99 Things to Do in Amman. I had an absolute BLAST exploring the city like a local and discovering everything from delicious food to ancient Roman ruins.Here are my top ten things to do when visiting Amman, Jordan!Visit the CitadelLocated in the center of downtown Amman you’ll find the ancient ruins of the Citadel. The site sits high on a hill and provides full panoramic views of the city.The most fascinating thing about this historical site is that it’s one of the world’s oldest continuously inhabited places dating back to the Neolithic period.Read More: The Ultimate Amman Travel GuideArabian Horseback RidingI had the opportunity to visit the Arabian Horse Club of Amman and I have to admit it was pretty special. I grew up around horses but never had the chance to ride an Arabian.Arabians have a reputation for being some of the most good-natured of all breeds. They are also the prized horses of the native desert Bedouin people of Jordan.Make Your Own PerfumeEver had the chance to choose from hundreds of scents to create your own perfume? It definitely beats shopping in a department store!In downtown Amman, there are tons of little perfume shops where you can test out musks and floral fragrances and bottle up your favorite. They even have some of the popular name brand perfumes like Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana, but for a fraction of the price.   [youtube id=”WkSGZuLmqso” width=”669″ height=”377″]Learn to Cook Arabic FoodThis was my favorite activity in Amman! Beit Sitti is an Arabic cooking school hosted in a cozy homestyle setting. You’ll learn to cook delicious Jordanian style food; like hummus, saffron rice and fattoush.Check out one of my “99 Things to do in Amman” videos highlighting my experience at Beit Sitti! Try Sugar Cane JuiceIn New York, you can grab a hot dog on just about every street corner. In Mexico, street tacos are easy to come by. In downtown Amman, be sure to try some of the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice.The flavor is refreshing and cool, but also a sweet and yummy treat! It’s the perfect afternoon refreshment!Relax at a Turkish BathFor all you spa lovers, a traditional Turkish bath is quite the experience. My first Turkish bath came as a bit of a surprise as you spend the day in nothing but your birthday suit!But don’t worry, men and women are separated into different rooms. After a hot jacuzzi, warm and cold saunas and a full body scrub, you leave feeling fresher and softer than a baby’s bum! Visit a Spice ShopA flavorful and colorful visit to the spice shop is a must! There are countless spices, nuts and other goodies!A few traditional Arabic spices you may not have heard of are Za’atar and Sumak. Be sure to grab some spices to bring back home to cook with!Read More: Highlights from the TBA Escapes Jordan Ancient Wonders Tour Enjoy a Cup of Arabic CoffeeMy love for coffee does not falter in any particular region. I am a devout café-holic.Arabic coffee can be distinguished between two types; Turkish and Saudi. In Jordanian tradition, coffee is served in small portions and the host/waiter will continue to serve more until the guest gestures he/she has had enough. Indulge in MezzeOh, how I miss mezze! Food is a very important part of Jordanian culture and mezze is the most popular style of eating. Mezze is basically what tapas or appetizers might be to other parts of the world; small plates cover the table before the main courses are served.Mezze is traditionally an assortment of hummus, fattoush (my personal favorite), falafel, baba ghanoush, tabbouleh, olives and pickles. It’s a vegetarian’s dream!Visit the Royal Automobile MuseumLast, but not least, be sure to check out the Royal Automobile Museum in Amman. It showcases the private collection of cars and motorcycles of the late King Hussein from the early 1920’s through present day.It’s an impressive collection (even if you’re not a big car fan). The museum showcases the automobiles in chronological order and is a fun way to learn about the history of The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.As you can see, Amman is full of unique things to see and do! While these are my favorite things to do in the capital, be sure to check out all of the 99 Things to Do in Amman on the Visit Jordan Website.Special thanks to the Jordan Tourism Board for hosting me on this trip. All opinions, as always, are my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/red-desert-dreams-in-wadi-rum/,Red Desert Dreams in Wadi Rum,Jordan,"Looking back on my time in Jordan, it’s so fascinating to me that my time in Wadi Rum desert, something so simple and seemingly boring, was one of my favorite experiences.The rose-red of the massive rock formations in that barren desert will forever remain emblazoned in my memory.I arrived in Wadi Rum after spending the previous day scuba diving in Aqaba. We drove north through the dry terrain, passing camel crossing signs along the way until we reached a small gas station along the road. My driver pulled over and I was introduced to a young man, no older than 20, who was going to be driving me through Wadi Rum on a 4×4 desert tour.Along either side of the truck bed were makeshift benches-turned-car seats. The driver fluffed the weathered mattress that lined the seat and backrest of the bench and helped me into the bed of the truck. Through broken English and a smile, my driver addressed me one last time as we pulled out of the gas station and into the sandy abyss.I think he said, “Hold on.”We tore through the desert’s dramatic landscape as I did my best to avoid bouncing out of the back of the truck. The massive granite and sandstone rock faces surrounding me jetted up to the heavens like seedlings towards the warmth of the sun. We drove through a narrow passage between two massive mountains and arrived at a Bedouin campsite. The Bedouin tribes are the desert people of Wadi Rum that still inhabit the area.I was offered an opportunity to continue part of my journey on the back of a camel, which I gladly accepted. A Bedouin man brought over one of his prized camels and the camel lowered itself down to the ground. Even with the camel tucked down on all fours, I had to hurl my body over its back and rearrange my legs to properly sit on its hump. As the camel began to stand, I was flung forward and then jerked backward almost getting flung off. Once my hump-backed friend found his stability, I looked down at the earth which now appeared to be 20 feet below me.Mounting a camel is not for the faint of heart.We rode through the desert together as I watched my shadow project upon the facade of the mountains. The camel and I as one. After a short ride, I said goodbye far too soon, but my 4×4 tour was just getting started. We loaded back into the truck and sped off again into the vast desert.The driver took me to some of the best lookouts and we even climbed a dune to view the full scenic panorama of the magnificent desert.  With every step I took, I would sink and slide back down the dune further than where I had started! Dune climbing should be an Olympic sport. We struggled our way to the top of the dune, but the view was completely worth it!Our desert tour led us to another Bedouin camp. Two Bedouin men greeted us in their traditional full-length white gowns (for lack of a better term) and red and white-checkered headscarves.I was invited inside for a cup of Bedouin WhiskeyEverywhere you travel in Jordan, you will be offered tea. In Wadi Rum, it is jokingly referred to as Bedouin Whiskey. It is customary to be served three cups. Hold the cup by the rim, do not set it down, and hand the cup back to your host for a refill. When you are done, simply wiggle the cup in your hand as you return the cup to your host.After Bedouin tea time, we hit the desert road for the final stretch of the journey towards my camp. I would be sleeping under the desert stars in a tent of my own tonight. We descended from the peak of our final dune as my camp appeared in the distance. Upon arrival, I was greeted by more friendly Bedouins and was showed to my tent. These were no traditional back-country tents, my friends.My ensuite tent at Captains Desert Camp had gorgeous drapery hanging from the ceiling and was lit by lanterns and candlelight. I even had my own bathroom.Not exactly roughing it!I hardly had time to set my bags down before I was rushing back out to catch the sunset! I jumped into the back of a truck, yet again, and we charged through the desert at the speed of the sunset. We arrived at the base of the mountain and practically ran up its steep face to reach a ledge that overlooked the entire Wadi Rum desert.My view opened up to one of the most stunning and beautiful things I had ever seen. The sunset shed its colors onto the massive mountains that seemed to go on forever in all directions. I stood awestruck at the mesmerizing beauty that stretched out before me. After we watched the sun hide behind the mountains, my grumbling tummy decided it was time to head back to camp.Dinner was being prepared for the entire campsite once we returned. Zarb, a Bedouin-style BBQ, is meat, potatoes and all kinds of vegetables cooked underground for extra deliciousness. We were led to the back of the camp where two men were uncovering some sort of desert manhole.They lifted the covering and steam and the essence of slow-cooked BBQ rose in the air. The Zarb was served with hummus, fresh bread and an array of delicious camp-style Bedouin specialties.After a sumptuous dinner, I joined fellow campers from around the world (Spain, Australia, Germany, etc.) by the campfire. The desert stars sparkled so brightly that they lit the entire desert night’s sky.We spent the rest of the evening staring up into the stars, sipping Bedouin Whiskey, smoking shisha and counting constellations. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/diving-in-the-red-sea/,Diving in the Red Sea,Jordan,"The southernmost tip of Jordan meets the Red Sea at the town of Aqaba. After spending the previous day at the Dead Sea, I was headed to Aqaba for an entirely different Jordanian experience: Diving! Aqaba is well known for its world class diving and gorgeous reefs with options for people of all levels of diving experience. There are over 30 main diving locations including a shipwrecked tank diving site!Aqaba is located near the borders of Egypt, Israel and Saudi ArabiaAfter checking into yet another beautiful Kempinksy Hotel in Aqaba, I was excited to get my feet wet. Last summer, I unsuccessfully attempted to scuba dive in the Great Barrier Reef, but learned some very important and valuable lessons:You cannot dive and fly in the same day. I planned on diving in the GBR and then flying out that evening. I was sadly notified that I would be unable to live out one of my lifelong dreams of diving for the first time in one of the most incredible wonders of the world. I still went snorkeling, but spare yourself the disappointment and plan ahead.Make sure you are listed on the crew sheet. I almost got left out at sea while on my trip to the GBR. You can read the full story about my Great Barrier Reef nightmare, but seriously, make sure the staff takes names after each dive!This time, I was fully prepared to dive!We went diving at two locations; one that was bustling with sea life and another that had an incredibly intricate coral reef. I had planned on sharing a video of the whole experience but, unfortunately, I learned that the GoPro Hero 2 doesn’t take good quality video underwater! I was so disappointed after reviewing the footage and finding everything grainy and completely unusable.Luckily, I brought my Canon s95 waterproof casing so I was able to capture some great photos of the experience. Here are some of my favorite shots:The perfect side profileI wanted to see him puff!Amazing view of the reefs full of fishSome of the divers exploring the reefAn eel hiding in the sea grassI had such an incredible time on my “discovery dive” thanks to my amazing dive master. I would highly recommend making Aqaba one of your choice destinations while visiting Jordan.I am oFISHally addicted!Read about my experience getting PADI scuba certified >>"
https://theblondeabroad.com/floating-in-the-dead-sea/,Floating in the Dead Sea,Jordan,"I have always wanted to visit the Dead Sea and float in its salty and mineral rich water. During my visit to Jordan in the Middle East, I was able to visit some of the most renowned destinations in the country. My first day outside of the capital city of Amman included a stop at Mount Nebo (where the Hebrew prophet Moses was given a view of the Promised Land), a visit to the city of Madaba and finally residing for the remainder of the day at the Dead Sea.Arriving at the Dead SeaA few factoids about the Dead Sea:Many people associate this destination with Israel, when in fact, it lies directly on the border of Israel and Jordan. Jordan to the East and Israel to the West.The Dead Sea is the lowest point of land on Earth at over 400 meters below sea level.At over 30% salinity (salt to water ratio aka about 10 times more salt than sea water), the water is incredibly dense. So much so that you are able to effortlessly float on the surface of the water.That’s not ice! It’s salt!I arrived at the Kempinski Hotel Ishtar Dead Sea in the early afternoon and was surprised to hear that I had been upgraded to one of their Executive Suites. The day was already off to a good start!The Dead Sea in Jordan is home to some of the most luxurious resorts in the entire country. I was so blown away by my suite that I made a short video tour to share with you. The view from my balcony was incredible!Time to Float!I quickly changed into my bikini and headed down to the sea. The resort has the Dead Sea equivalent to what I would describe as “pool boys” employed by the resort. A few of these “Dead Sea boys” are down by the beach area of the seaside ready to offer you a chair, towel and water.When traveling alone it’s hard to capture those magic moments without someone else playing photographer. But, I found a solution! I brought my LifeProof waterproof iPhone case and XShot camera extender so that I could capture my first float in the Dead Sea. Photography gadgets in hand… it was time to get to floating!The Blonde Afloat! Warning!There are a few guidelines you MUST follow when visiting the Dead Sea:Do NOT shave for a few days before your swim. I waited almost four days and could still feel the slight tingling of the salt on my legs. Shaving will most definitely ruin your trip and make contact with the salt water unbearable.Do NOT get the water in your eyes! No joke it’s like being temporarily blinded. Many people wear goggles in for extra precaution. I wore my sunglasses in and accidentally got a tiny drop of water in my right eye. I had to get out and cry it out. It was painful.Check out my video of the floating action!Time to Mud Up!I’m like a little kid when it comes to getting messy so when I heard you could cover yourself in the Dead Sea mineral mud… well, you can guess what happened.I’m so pleased with myselfWhen I arrived everyone was getting smeared with the Dead Sea mud by the Dead Sea boys but nobody approached me. I assumed it was an additional service that I had to pay for. After an hour of relaxing I asked one of the guests if it was a spa treatment. Apparently there’s a little unspoken insider mud code I was unaware of. Simply let the Dead Sea boys know you want “new mud” and the scrub. (It’s free for hotel guests!) They’ll then go scoop out some of the dark virgin sea mud and cover you in it. Sometimes beauty is just plain ugly!It’s the Dead Sea Monster!Scrub a Dub Dead!After waiting 20 minutes for the mud to dry and then washing off in the Dead Sea, return to the Dead Sea boys for a full body scrub made of a fragrant oil and salt crystals. After a third dip in the Dead Sea your skin will feel softer than a baby’s bum!An important note: Be sure to leave your favorite bikini behind. I wore an all black bikini and the Dead Sea mud didn’t seem to wash out. Even after a few soapy scrubs the water was still murky with remnants of mud.Sunsets and Belly DancersAfter parting ways with the salty sea, I went up to the soup bowl shaped infinity pool at the resort to watch the sunset. I think pictures will describe the moment better than I could ever put into words.Dead Sea SunsetThe sunset was, very simply put, spectacular. I ended my evening with dinner and a show. An outdoor BBQ served all sorts of Middle Eastern food while a live band and belly dancer performed.It was the perfect ending to a magical and muddy day at the Dead Sea!"

Having been three times, I find myself falling more in love with each visit.Something about its historical past, the preservation of arts, and natural beauty set it apart from other cities. Though it is an expansive city, it’s quite different from Tokyo and Osaka, two others frequently visited in Japan.The slower pace in Kyoto gives you a chance to immerse yourself in traditional Japanese culture.Nearby, natural landscapes like Arashiyama are opportunities to get outdoors. And of course, you can’t forget the temples, 1,600 of them to be exact. It’s the ultimate place to visit on any trip to Japan.Ready to explore Kyoto? Here’s my ultimate three-day itinerary to the city!Best  Time to GoSince the weather is rather temperate in Kyoto, it can be an ideal year-round destination. Each season ranges in temperature but nothing too extreme. The summer months of June-August are hotter and more humid and the winter months of December-February are colder.The ideal time to visit for me would be in the fall months to catch autumn colors or spring for the cherry blossom festivals. In the fall, the maple trees light up in bright pops of oranges and reds, making it incredibly scenic. Of course, those delicate pink cherry blossoms in the early spring is an iconic experience for Japan as well.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Japan  Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto  Where to StayMy personal preference for Kyoto is to be close to the Gion District or near Nishiki Market. The central location for both of these means easy access to nearby sights.One travel tip would be to book accommodations near a metro station as you’ll often use the local metro to get out to the temples and experiences.One great hotel in the Gion District is the Kyoto Granbell Hotel. On the last trip, I stayed a bit further north but conveniently near a metro stop at the Ritz-Carlton, Kyoto. It’s a splurge stay but worth every penny.Airbnb is also an incredible way to experience local homes in Kyoto. I often combine an Airbnb stay with a hotel stay when traveling here.  Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js'); Kamo River Chao Chao Sanjo Kiyamichi Your First NightOn arrival, I’d recommend making the scenic walk alongside the Kamo River near Gion-Shijo station. At night, the buildings light up and reflect across the river.If you catch the sunset here, it’s even more scenic.Adjacent to the river is the wonderful Pontocho Alley. A tight alley filled with endless restaurants and bars where there is something for everyone. I like to walk through the alley (the atmosphere is lively!) and head to my favorite gyoza restaurant, Chao Chao Sanjo Kiyamichi.They serve traditional thin skin gyoza made extra crispy, stuffed with an assortment of meats and cheese.  Day 1: Explore Arashiyama + Philospher’s PathExplore EarlyIf there’s one expert tip for making the most of Kyoto, it’s getting up early. Beating the crowds can be challenging but waking up for an early morning is a sure bet. Head straight out to Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (reachable by metro or taxi) to have it to yourself. I usually show up at sunrise and love how quiet it is with just a few locals running through.Tip: Walk to the end of the grove where the split is and look back for an incredible photo.Nearby, as you wait for the famed % Arabica Kyoto Arashiyama to open up for coffee (daily at 8 am), take a beautiful walk along Katsura River. The morning light here is beautiful for photography and the traditional wooden boats are incredible.  Lunch + Afternoon Walk to a Quiet TempleAs you’ll already be on the outskirts of town, I find it worth heading across to one of the other furthest experiences across town. Take the metro across and consider a taxi to get to where the Philosopher’s Path is.Tip: If the metro option is too long, Uber is a convenient and affordable way of getting across Kyoto.You can grab lunch at a traditional udon restaurant called Omen to fuel up for the day — don’t forget to slurp your noodles! Just outside of the restaurant is the start of the scenic path that follows a riverfront. In season, the cherry blossoms here are famous. Along the way, small boutiques and ice cream shops are there.Just another 10-minute walk up the hill is a favorite place to beat the crowds.Hōnen-in Temple is a moss-covered temple that sits perched up on the hillside. In the late afternoon, you’ll find you often have it to yourself.  Here CaféDay 2: Local Goods + Flavors of KyotoSlow BreakfastStart the day by heading over to Here Café for a beautiful space and a slow breakfast. Their coffee bar has a wonderful selection of drinks as well. Traditional Japanese breakfast often can be more savory than sweet, but Here Café has some great sweet pastries as well.Tip: Kyoto has a wonderful selection of local coffee shops. Here are 7 not to miss.Explore the Market + Shop LocalOne thing unique to Kyoto is the plethora of artisanal goods made locally. One spot to get to see a wide range is at Nishiki Market. This market hall sells everything imaginable and a good spot to get a bite to eat from one of the many vendors. If you like Takoyaki (fried dough balls stuff with octopus), the stands in the market are a wonderful spot to try it.For more Japanese kitchenware and ceramics, you can check out these 7 shops in Kyoto as well. A few are just around the corner from the market and make for great gifts to bring home. Ippudo Wajouryoumen Sugari Ramen DinnerA must-do thing in Kyoto is eating ramen. There are hundreds of styles of ramen and each chef has their own take on it. Hunting for new ramen in Kyoto has become a favorite experience and there are a few I love to recommend.The first is the iconic chain Ippudo. You order from a ticketing vending machine and get seated behind a wall where magically your order appears. The ramen here is a great introduction.One of the best local spots in Kyoto for fattier broth ramen is at Honke DaiichiAsahi near the train station. I’ve waited in the line for forty-five minutes before and it’s worth it. This is my favorite ramen spot in Kyoto after trying several locations.For a more upscale and refined ramen experience, wait in line for Wajouryoumen Sugari. The line will move fast here, so just buy a ticket with your ramen preference and follow the line. The ramen here has a stronger fish broth than most but rich in taste.Read More:10 Local Foods to Try in Japan  Fushimi Inari ShrineDay 3: Sights + TemplesMorning at the Red GatesFushimi Inari Shrine features a path creates by traditional, bright red gates leading up the mountainside. This another amazing experience to do while in Kyoto and worth waking up early to have it less crowded. It’s one of my favorite photography locations in Kyoto alongside these.Tip: Take the metro to Inari Station for quick access to the path.  Explore the Historic District of SannenzakaThis may be one of the most scenic areas of Kyoto to see. These pedestrian streets are lined with traditional wooden homes and buildings. The atmosphere is wonderful. You can shop for local goods here as well and stop in for lunch at one of the many restaurants.A few favorite places to see in this district include Kōdaiji Temple, the wired good store Kanaamitsuji, dessert at Rakushō, and Nineizaka street.  Kiyomizu-dera Temple   Afternoon With a ViewTo end the day, head up to the Kiyomizu-dera temple. Later in the afternoon, the crowds tend to be milder. As you climb up, you have expansive views over the city. If the timing is right, you can catch the sunset here as well. This temple is one of the most impressive in Kyoto.Tip: Be sure to check opening hours as the times vary depending on the time of year.Afterward, there are many options for dinner nearby or reference this list for the 20 best restaurants.OverallOverall Kyoto is a wonderful destination for an itinerary in Japan. The traditional architecture, a plethora of sights to see, and a deep sense of history make it truly unique. You can easily spend a week here and not see it all.Check out this ultimate guide to Kyoto to see more things to do in the city. "

With a unique way of life that you simply will not find anywhere else on the planet, this is one of those places that sticks in your mind long after you leave.From eating at robot restaurants to getting a mermaid manicure to wandering through the cherry blossoms, there is a surprise around every corner in Japan. The Land of the Rising Sun is a dynamic mix of modern and tradition that will absolutely fascinate you.Ready to say konnichiwa? Here are my top ten tips for your first trip to Japan!   Try All the FoodsYou guys are always asking me which country has the best food in the world. While I have sampled some amazing dishes around the globe, few places can compete with Japan.From the best sushi restaurants in Tokyo to the culinary delights of 7-Eleven (seriously!) you will find on every corner, every meal is an experience in Japan.One of the key things I learned while traveling around Japan is that oftentimes the best food comes from the least expected spots.Forget about white tablecloths and famous chefs! If you are looking for good sushi, look for the tiny spots that barely give you room to squeeze into your chair.For a fun and quick treat, grab sushi from one of the bullet train platforms.Served up by a robot, it’s a bit below Japanese standards but just as good as you would find in a decent Western sushi spot. Before you go, check out a few essential Japanese foods you must try on your trip (and they’re not what you’re thinking!).Hold on to Your GarbageWhile you will find vending machines, eating on the street is fairly rare and so are public garbage cans.If you find yourself accumulating trash on the go, hold onto it. It is actually quite common for women to carry little plastic bags in their purse to collect the little bits of trash they end up with as they go throughout the day.The cities of Japan are very clean and it is something they pride themselves on. Do your part by hanging onto your stuff until you can properly dispose of it.   Learn About  the CultureI would highly recommend going on a tour with a local to take a deeper dive into the culture and customs.It will much SUCH a difference in your overall experience and make everything along the way more meaningful. The language barrier often makes it hard to appreciate everything going on around you so local info goes a long way.When you are on tour with a local, ask him or her about the surgical mask phenomenon that you will notice as soon as you hit the streets.Before you go, do remember that some things are quite different.For example, tattoos are not the norm there. While it’s okay to show them on the streets if you don’t mind a bit of attention, some onsens (Japanese hot springs) require them to be covered.And come ready the fanciest toilets of your life! Almost all of them have different functions from seat heating to ambient noise for privacy and water and air sprays. It’s definitely a bit weird at first but you will come to appreciate them.Before you go, read my full guide to Japan so get a better idea of what to expect across the board.Use the Local  TransportationPublic transport is easy, cheap, and actually pretty fun. I actually find local transportation to be one of the best ways to get to know a place and its people better.Every major city in Japan has a subway system and it will be a key part of your trip. For longer distances, the bullet train is the best way to get around. While it can be kind of confusing when you’re first trying to figure it out, it’s worth it!Finding a Place to StayThink small! Everything in Japan is going to be smaller than you’d expect. From cars to restaurants to hotels, the Japanese have jammed a lot onto a little island—so don’t expect oversized places.If you’re considering an apartment stay, know that Airbnb is highly restricted in Japan. All hosts are required to be licensed and it’s likely to get stricter so check for the most up-to-date laws before you book.Hotels are generally a good option and, since they’re all going to be pretty tiny, pod hotels can be a fun and novel alternative.The WeatherThe weather is Japan varies quite a bit depending on the season. In the winter, the north and central part of the country gets very cold and, especially in the mountainous areas, snowy.Fun Fact: Did you know that the northern point of Japan is just 30 miles from Russia? We are talking about a Siberian level of cold!Meanwhile, in the heart of summer, you will see temps reaching up to 90 degrees F in some spots. And it’s a sticky heat! Much of Japan is quite humid; ultralightweight clothing is best, and plan for mosquitos.Read my full rundown on the best time to go to Japan to plan what to do when.No TippingWhile it’s generally not the norm outside of North America, it is actually considered rude in Japan.No matter how amazing the food or service was, don’t leave cash! The best and most respectful way move is to simply say thanks and compliment the server and/or chef.In more casual spots, you can ask for the check by simply making an “X” sign with your index fingers (avoid this at fancier eateries though). Take Off Your ShoesMany places will request that you leave your shoes at the door. Get in the habit of checking as soon as you walk inside. It’s a major faux pas to come stomping in with dirty shoes.Pause at the door to have a look around. Are there cubbies with shoes in them? Are there slippers set out?If you see Western-style tables and chairs, there is a good chance you can wear your shoes in…but if not, assess your surroundings. And, of course, the best clue is to simply look at the feet of those already inside.  A Mix of Old and NewThere is a fascinating mix of old and new throughout Japan.Where the Shinto shrines meet the neon jungle, you will find something oh-so-special. The blend of ultra-traditional and cartoonishly futuristic is what makes Japan a place unlike anywhere else.Whatever you do, make sure to see both sides of the country.While there is SO much to explore, Tokyo is an essential visit. And, even within the city, there is a mountain of choice in front of you! Here were some of my highlights of visiting Tokyo.Go for a Night of KaraokeOnce you are head over heels in love with Japan, you are ready to serenade her. Sing your heart out at and have an amazing night of karaoke.Head down to the Shinjuku district and into Tokyo’s famous Golden Gai area for a drink to loosen up those vocal cords.

Whether you’re looking for a snowy vacation in Hokkaido or you want to soak in the views of the cherry blossoms in Tokyo, the best time to visit all depends on what you want to see and do!The country prides itself on having four distinct seasons, and let me tell you…the way the weather impacts the scenery can only be described as pure magic! Plus, festivals take place year-round so there isn’t exactly a “wrong” time to enjoy a Japanese getaway!Heading to the Land of the Rising Sun? Here are the best times to travel to Japan!    March to MaySpring in Japan means temperatures begin to rise after a chilly winter and the flowers begin to blossom. In the south, you’ll experience balmy warmth and in the north, it still remains pretty cool.The highlight of spring is, of course, the cherry blossoms! Also known as sakura, the cherry blossoms in Japan are reason enough to make a trip during spring. However, they are only in full bloom for around a week or two out of the whole year…so you’ve got to get really lucky and plan accordingly.Japanese people view the blooming of the flowers as a symbol of human life and nobleness and they hold flower watching parties known as “hanami.” There are tons of cherry blossom-flavored treats and specialties during this time. Now that’s something I’d definitely want to take part in!But don’t fret if you miss out on the festivals or the peak weeks. After full bloom, the petals begin to float to the ground and it almost looks like it’s snowing hues of pink and white! It’s said to be the most beautiful at this stage.Read More: 10 Tips for Your First Trip to Japan   TokyoJune to AugustAlthough summer in Japan means rainy season, it’s also the season of grand fireworks, large festivals, and food stalls galore. Despite the humidity, travelers from all over the world come to experience the culture and parties that take place.In fact, there are so many festivals I don’t even know where to begin. During July in Kyoto, there is Gion Matsuri, one of the country’s most popular festivals. It’s known for its grand procession of floats called “Yamaboko Junko.” In the Port of Yokohama, over 6,000 fireworks are shot off to celebrate the beginning of summer!In Aomori City, locals revel with floating lanterns and thousands of chanting dancers for the Nebuta Matsuri festival!Whether you’re planning your trip around a celebration or you’re just looking to explore the cities, I highly recommend packing lightweight clothes and booking in advance.Also, if you’re taking photos be prepared for your lens to possibly fog up in certain locations due to the humidity.    September to NovemberOnce the summer warmth fades, Japan is covered with colorful autumnal hues. These leaves draw just as many travelers as the cherry blossoms do. In fact, viewing the leaves has been a popular activity for centuries. The best places to spot the fall foliage are at parks, temples, and the mountains.If you want to see the foliage for yourself head to Niseko, Hachimanti, Mt. Nasu-dake, Kinu-gawa river, and Mt. Fuji.   Shirakawa, JapanDecember to FebruaryBecause the climate varies vastly by region, there’s no blanketed way to describe winter in Japan. Bigger cities like Tokyo and Osaka experience little snowfall and sunny days. But if you head into the mountains, snowfall occurs almost every single day.That’s why Hokkaido is one of the best places in the world for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. They also put on the Sapporo Snow Festival—an international contest of giant snow sculptures.And you can’t forget New Years! Japan becomes jam-packed between December 29th and January 10th, as there are a ton of activities and celebrations. This means full occupancy at hotels, high rates, and overcrowded public transportation.However, there’s nothing like experiencing New Years in Toyko, just be sure to plan ahead of time.Come February, the scuba diving season begins and sea life such as sea turtles, sharks, sea horses, and manatees can be spotted in the waters. If you’re willing to brave the chill of the water, it’s also the best time to see some humpback whales. 10 Tips for Your First Trip to TokyoA dizzying blend of the traditional and ultra-modern, Tokyo is unlike anywhere you have ever been before.

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-japan/,10 Local Foods to Try in Japan,Japan,"Whilst exploring Tokyo, I was introduced to a whole new foodie scene! Japan is seriously POPPIN’ when it comes to incredibly savory foods and aesthetically-pleasing confectionaries.When most people think of Japanese food, they think of sushi or ramen but when you dive deeper into the Japanese culture and cuisine, you’ll find so many incredible dishes bursting with flavor.Very distinct spices and ingredients are used in these dishes, making them quite unique from anything else in the world. In fact, these foods coined the term “umami,” which refers to foods that are savory and often soy-based.Whether you’re visiting Japan or want to try authentic Japanese foods in your hometown, consider one of these 10 dishes!   Where to Find the Best Food in Tokyo Read MoreRamenYou’re probably extremely familiar with ramen as it has taken over the food scene by storm…and for good reason!The noodle dish was originally made with chicken bone broth but as it has become modernized, pork, beef, and seafood are being used, creating a diverse range of savory flavors. There are so many different varieties. So MANY. GyozaJuicy on the inside and golden brown on the outside, gyoza is a pan-fried Japanese dumpling.Filled with veggies or protein, these delicious dumplings are served at specialty shops, izakaya, ramen shops, grocery stores, and even at festivals.    SushiSushi rolls in America have become a lot more complex in comparison to those in Japan.Sushi in Japan is typically sushi rice, fish, and nori (seaweed). There’s definitely no cream cheese or avocado involved! It’s all about sweet simplicity. You can find sushi in little huts, higher-end places, 7/11 (yes, really!), and of course, the iconic conveyor belt sushi places.At the “sushi train” places, you can enjoy sushi for 100 yen a plate. That’s a little less than a dollar! Be prepared to stack tons of plates as you sample all the delicacies. OkonomiyakiOkonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake that can contain an array of ingredients.The name is derived from the word “okonomi” meaning “how you like” or “what you like” and yaki means “cooked.” Ingredients can include green onion, thin pork belly, octopus, squid, shrimp, veggies, mochi, or even cheese. Miso SoupMiso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that is one of the two essential soups of Japanese cuisine.It’s typically made of a stock called “dashi” and softened miso paste. It’s so popular that 75% of all Japanese people consume miso soup at least once a day—oftentimes even for breakfast. That’s a whole lot of soup! KaraageKaraage, sometimes known as Tatsuta-age, is fried chicken seasoned with soy sauce, salt, and other spices. In lieu of ketchup or mustard, it’s typically dipped in mayo. You’ll often find it served with rice and shredded cabbage or on its own.It was one of Anthony Bourdain’s favorite dishes and I think that says a lot. Katsudon or TonkatsuTonkatsu is a dish that consists of a breaded deep-fried pork cutlet served with Japanese Worcestershire sauce, rice, and veggie salad. Soba NoodlesSoba is Japanese for buckwheat and soba noodles are made of buckwheat flour eaten with a soy and sugar sauce. The noodles are often topped with egg, tempura, and other ingredients.The noodles can be found in a variety of settings, from more “fast-food” restaurants to expensive specialty restaurants. Kare RaisuCurry isn’t just an Indian dish!Kare Raisu is one of the most popular dishes in Japan and it’s rice with curry. The basic ingredients are onions, carrots, and potatoes, beef, pork, and chicken. TempuraTempura is a dish in which seafood, meat, or fresh vegetables are dipped in flour and egg batter and dipped and fried in oil. It was influenced by fritter cooking techniques that were introduced by the Portuguese who lived in Nagasaki during the 16th century.And it was that Portuguese influence that gave tempura its name! It comes from ‘ad tempora cuaresme,’ meaning “in the time of Lent.” As the Portuguese missionaries were not eating meat during lent, they found other things to replace it. Pretty interesting when you get those cross-cultural influences, huh? Bonus: Desserts + 7-ElevenJapanese desserts! They’ve got serious style when it comes to desserts and green tea-flavored sweets are where it’s at—from green ice cream to mini matcha mochi cakes (say that five times fast!).I know the reputation of 7-Eleven in the US is all about snack food and Slurpees…but the 7-Eleven in Japan is so surprisingly good! You can get everything from karaage to sushi (decent sushi at that!) and a whole spread of Japanese desserts! If given the chance, I highly suggest trying everything on this list. Japanese cuisine is full of rich and delicious flavors and shouldn’t be missed.What’s your favorite Japanese food?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-tokyo/,Where to Find the Best Food in Tokyo,Japan,"This Tokyo Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!13.5 million people reside in the city of Tokyo (there are 8.6 million people in New York City for reference).Yet this city, the largest in Japan, somehow feels incredibly organized and exudes a welcoming warmth. It has a palpable sense of pride in its food, dress, and design, and it’s clean enough to literally eat off the busy streets.  The politeness and generosity of the people in Tokyo never falter with manners and respect at the forefront of every interaction. Their friendliness is almost a shock to the system, often catching you by surprise in the best way possible. The same care and kindness is felt in the food; the quality, the attention to detail, and the service. I had mostly Japanese cuisine, but when I veered off track I was just as impressed. The food in Japan is so fun and vibrant it feels more like art than a meal. Here’s where to find the best food in Tokyo! NarukiyoI was determined to make it to an izakaya for our first meal. I had been told these establishments– Japanese pubs– are a great introduction to the food in Japan and now having tried one, I would be inclined to agree.Narukiyo, in particular, was by far one of the funkiest, quirkiest and most unconventional places I have ever dined. There are phallic photos and ornaments strewn about, mismatched plates with sketches of everything from Sumo wrestlers to James Dean on them, and an old-school American soundtrack blasting fun tunes in the background.  The owner was an absolute gem of a man, his unique personality clearly shone through, and he helped to make the experience one that I will not soon forget.RokurinshaIn most countries eating food from a train station would be something you went well out of your way to avoid. In Japan, it’s the total opposite.Rokurinsha, a ramen spot, is located in the area of Tokyo Station literally named Ramen Street. There will be a line since both locals and tourists love this spot, but the system is so efficient it won’t take long.As some point during your wait you’ll be grabbed by a member of staff, walked over to a machine you will punch your order into, all timed so perfectly that by the time you’re seated those noodles will be in front of you!Sushi NakamuraAt 9:00 pm on our second night in Tokyo we sat down to our first Michelin star meal in Japan. A Michelin restaurant is certainly not something I go out of my way to seek out.I am just as happy with a complete hole in the wall serving awesome, memorable food with authentic vibes, as I am with a perfected art show of sorts.  But in this city, where there were 234 restaurants that took this honor in 2017, you have to try at least one… right? It’s literally impossible to figure out how to choose which to go to, more difficult of a choice than in any other city, but eventually, I landed on Sushi Nakamura as the one.  The mood is quiet, but not so silent that you feel you can’t speak. The restaurant seats 11, as is typical for Japanese omakase style sushi spots. All patrons meals are timed perfectly with one another and dishes are presented one after the other for about an hour and a half. The central focus of the meal are the 12 pieces of nigiri, surrounded by small cooked seafood centric plates like Japanese blowfish, smoked clam and a killer egg tamago for dessert.Koffee MameyaBefore you even step foot into Koffee Mameya, you know you are about to be privy to something special. The entranceway itself makes you feel like you are walking into a high-end spa, with stones covering the ground and black-washed wood walls to greet you.Inside you’ll find a super charismatic and passionate staff behind the small counter, walking you through the 13 varieties of beans they have on hand from countries around the world. The treatment is somewhat like a brewery– talking through options, taste tasting, making a selection with guidance from the experts. The space is tiny but the experience is tremendous; definitely worth a visit.  Mr. FarmerOne of the things that struck me about the city of Tokyo was how incredibly varied the different areas were. You could look at a dizzying display of Harajuku girls and colorful cotton candy the size of your head one minute, and fall upon a street lined with funky boutiques and gorgeous city garden homes the next.Vegetarian friendly Mr. Farmer, which they coin as a “vegetable cafe” was located minutes outside of the crazed Harajuku section, in the entirely calm and sleek Omotesando Hills.  It was gorgeous here, and we were in dire need of a few hours to slow down the pace, so we settled in for some uber healthy and astonishingly delicious veggie based food, everything we needed to regroup and reset.Pizza Studio TamakiIn recent months it has become more mainstream knowledge, partially in thanks to David Chang’s Netflix show “Ugly Delicious,” that Tokyo is home to some pretty excellent pizza. Many say it even competes with Naples or Rome, Italy. I am here to tell you that this claim actually is absolutely true. Every part of the pizza at the newly opened Pizza Studio Tamaki wowed me, easily putting it into one of my favorites throughout the world. The “tamaki” option is the house favorite, so with just a bit of encouragement from the owner, it’s the one we settled on. A crispy dough made with a blend of U.S. and Japanese flour, topped with char grilled cherry tomatoes, smoked mozzarella, Pecorino Romano hard cheese and basil.HakkokuHakkoku was so fiercely and wholly unbelievable that while I stand by the fact that our first omakase experience was a great one, this next one was a level beyond. I have never in my life seen a set up of a restaurant quite like the one at Hakkuko.  It is like you are walking into another world, where bamboo plants thrive and fatty tuna appears from fancy black boxes (literally). There are three small dining areas here, each with only six seats around a small L shaped counter, each operated by its own chef over the two-plus hours you are there.Though the utter tranquility is hugely palpable, the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Our chef Jun Saito was having fun, and he wanted us to as well.The menu is designed to lead you through 38 pieces of sushi, 37 that are nigiri style served with a rice browned by vinegar, and one that is a fantastic tuna hand roll right at the start.  Go here, settle in, and prepared to have the meal of your life.Henry’s BurgerI don’t eat burgers but my travel buddy does, and she gave great reviews of Henry’s. I read about this small, takeaway only spot many times in my lead up to this trip, and encouraged her to try it out to see if it lived up to the hype. Sounds like it most certainly did.Afuri RamenAfrui Ramen is another awesome joint where your finger does the food picking ahead of time, and the service is quick and efficient. The selections are slightly broader than at Rokurinsha, but most of that choice comes in the forms of toppings; soft boiled eggs, braised pork, nori, bamboo shoots.  I went with the vegan ramen here, not knowing if a city mostly known for it’s pork based broths would be any good at all. Turns out it was- it was the most impressed I’ve been with a ramen yet.   "

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-tokyos-golden-gai/,The Ultimate Guide to Tokyo’s Golden Gai,Japan,"You’ve never been anywhere like Golden Gai. A throwback to days gone by, this area of the Shinjuku district gives you a glimpse into what the city looked like in the 1950s.With endless shanty-style bars and interesting architecture, this is not your usual nightlife scene. Most of the bars are just a few feet wide and offer a real one-of-a-kind experience.Ready to rub shoulders (literally) with the locals? Here’s my ultimate guide to Tokyo’s Golden Gai. History of Golden GaiGolden Gai, also known as the Golden District, is made up of six incredibly tiny alleys jam-packed with almost two hundred bars. This area actually started out as a black market in the 1950s and still looks pretty much the same. It was famous for prostitution until the sixties when it becoming a drinking hot spot.During the eighties, the bar owners guarded the area around the clock to prevent the Yakuza from burning the bars down.Despite the crazy history, Golden Gai is now ultra safe and friendly to female tourists. The Shinjuku DistrictGolden Gai is located within Tokyo’s Shinjuku District. It’s less than a ten-minute walk from the east exit of Shinjuku station.Each bar has different hours, but generally, the neighborhood operates from 5:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. Things are in full swing around eleven p.m.Most of the bars don’t serve food, so you’ll want to go for dinner before drinks. For the culinary equivalent of Golden Gai, check out Omoide Yokocho. Full of tiny hole-in-the-wall eateries, this little street serves up authentic Japanese grub.For a totally unforgettable dinner and show before the bar, check out the nearby Robot Restaurant in Tokyo! The Bars in Golden GaiEach and every spot in Golden Gai is different. Every place has its own claim to fame, whether it’s crazy decor, a signature cocktail, or so-bad-it’s-good karaoke. You’ll hear everything from punk music to flamenco blasting.Be sure to check out the view from Albatross, live it up in the leopard-print Kenzo’s Bar, or check out the crazy cocktail menu at Bar Darling. And keep going! There are so many bars to see, and they’re all interesting in their own way.While I would normally say, “go where the locals go,” Golden Gai is still very “locals only.” Many bars have signs that say “no photos” and “no tourists” so be respectful.To see which bars are tourist-friendly, the easiest thing to do is hit up TripAdvisor. While the bars are ultra small, you will find a lot of them reviewed online, so you can narrow it down to the most tourist-friendly spots and the ones that look the most like your style.Helpful Tip: Before you go, grab cash. Drinks aren’t too pricey by international standards but entry costs, table costs, and drinks can add up, and they are cash only pretty much everywhere. Getting Around Golden GaiAs you’re wandering down the tiny streets of Golden Gai, you’ll notice a mash-up of English and Japanese signage. If you see English info outside the bar, you know it is tourist-friendly.Spots that only advertise to locals can be tricky. Some of them only welcome regular customers—but of the bar really speaks to you, give it a try! Walk in, flash a smile, and see if they welcome you. You won’t be the first tourist who has visited, or the last.Some bars have a cover charge, and you’ll want to have cash handy as soon as you get to the door. Charges vary quite a bit and can go up to 4,000 Japanese yen ($35 USD) for the fancy spots.Helpful Tip: Some people in Tokyo don’t speak English or are shy to show their skills. I highly recommend having a basic vocab list with you and downloading Google translate offline for your phone.If you’re nervous, try starting off at Albatross, Champion (for some karaoke), Kenzo’s Bar, Totobar Shinjuku (for sake), or Bar Araku (no cover for international tourists). Don’t miss my favorite Tokyo-inspired styles! !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-robot-restaurant-in-tokyo/,Visiting the Robot Restaurant in Tokyo,Japan,"You can’t go to Tokyo without checking out the Robot Restaurant. While it may be touristy, the place puts on a show like no other. If you are into the crazy, colorful, high-tech side of Japanese culture, you are going to love this.Here’s my experience visiting the Robot Restaurant in Tokyo!Shinjuku’s Kabukicho DistrictJapan’s largest red light district, the Shinjuku’s Kabukicho District, is the place to be at night. Don’t let the “red light” district idea put you off. This area is totally friendly to female travelers.It’s the perfect spot to check out Tokyo nightlife. And the Robot Restaurant.There are tons of bars, clubs, and other local hangouts. Really, you can have a great night out just wandering around the Kabukicho District to take photos and do some people watching.Read Next: The Ultimate Guide to Tokyo’s Golden GaiWhat to Expect InsideGrab a sake and get ready to be impressed. The Robot Restaurant in Tokyo offers a cabaret-style show with singing, dancing, girls, robots, and a whole lot of things that you will only find in Japan.There’s nothing understated about this place. Rumor has it that it cost a whopping 10 billion yen ($89.5 million USD) to build the Robot Restaurant. It has all of the bells and whistles along with more sights and sounds than you could ever take in.ReservationsYou’ll need to make reservations. Depending on the time of year, there are three to four shows per day running from early evening to ten at night.You can make a reservation on the restaurant’s website up until 5:00 p.m. on the day of the show. You can also call after 5:00. When you book, you’ll pay an entrance fee of 8,000 yen (around $70 USD).Helpful Tip: A week before I flew to Tokyo, I bought discounted tickets through an third party which I would suggest as well. There are lots of websites offering tickets so do your research!You can also pay an extra 1,000 yen (around $9 USD) for a meal. Honestly, the food isn’t too impressive though, and it’s a bit pricey for what you get. Basically, it’s a bento box with an assortment of mini portions: dishes like tempura or nimono. Once inside, you can buy sake and beer during breaks in the show.Helpful Tip: I’d recommend getting into the Shinjuku area a bit early and checking out some of the other local eateries.When you book, you’ll notice that there’s a dress code.This means no sunglasses, “costumes,” or large wigs. So, it’s pretty easy to get ready for a night out there. Casual is good, but you won’t stick out if you do want to dress up. It’s important to note, however, that you can’t have any visible tattoos.Helpful Tip: In Japan, tattoos are strongly associated with the mafia and are nowhere near as common as they are in the West. You’ll actually see “no tattoo” signs in pools and gyms. If you’ve got visible tattoos, you’ll want to bring at least an outfit or two that can cover them.The Robot Restaurant ExperienceAnthony Bourdain called the Robot Restaurant the “greatest show on earth.” That guy has seen more than a few shows, so you know this is the real deal.When you arrive at the Robot Restaurant, you’ll be greeted by a friendly (English-speaking) staff member. They will give you your seat number and then it’s up to you to decide how long you want to take to get there.The entire journey to the stage area is an explosion of colors, sounds, and lights. I would highly recommend getting to the restaurant early so you have plenty of times to discover the decor and take photos.As for the show itself, it is always changing, but expect lots of lights, dancing and, you guessed it, robots! Halfway through, you’ll get a light stick so that you can join in. It really is a one-of-a-kind experience and SO much fun!Only in Tokyo!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/singapore-airlines-business-class-flight-from-la-to-tokyo/,Singapore Airlines Business Class Flight from LA to Tokyo,Japan,"There’s nothing like arriving at your destination feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world. Flying business class can totally transform your travel. My recent trip from Los Angeles to Tokyo was a dream.The trip takes a whopping twelve hours (and that’s if you’re on a nonstop flight). When you are in transit for that long, it is essential to be able to get comfortable. For the sake of some extra room to spread out, I upgraded my latest adventure.Here’s my Singapore Airlines Business Class flight experience from LAX to Tokyo!What to ExpectFor the past twenty-two years, Singapore Airlines has been known for having the world’s best business class. Having travelled business class on a few different airlines, I was looking forward to seeing how Singapore Airlines actually stacked up to the competition.From the dedicated Singapore Airlines Business Class check-in counters and Business Class Lounge to the top-notch on-board service, these guys didn’t disappoint.With oversized seats, massive LCD screens, and five-star food, Singapore Airlines checks all the boxes.Upon BoardingThe flight attendants are affectionately known as Singapore Girls. They are famous for their world-class charm and nonstop smiles. Having spent a ton of time in airplanes, I know that being a flight attendant is a tough job. But the Singapore Airlines crew never lets it show. The attendants are consummate pros. They greet you with a smile, and even after a dozen hours in the air, they are still energetic.After getting a first-class welcome, I got the chance to explore my seat and check out where I was going to be spending the day.AmenitiesOne cool bonus of flying Singapore Airlines Business Class is that you’ve got direct access to the aisle. Forget about debating whether you are going to risk waking up your neighbor so you can get to the toilet! Wherever you sit, you have got a forward-facing seat right next to the aisle.On such a long flight, this is a major perk.Unlike other airlines, Singapore doesn’t offer personal amenity kits in business class. This was definitely a first for me. However, they offer nearly everything you’d find in a typical amenity kit a la carte — toothbrushes and shaving kits in the restrooms, you just have to ask the flight attendants for eye masks, socks and slippers if needed. Not a big deal and definitely results in less waste!On all long-haul flights, I come prepared either way! I always pack compression socks, a face mask sheet, Evian facial mist, a hydrating lip balm and facial serum. Staying hydrated is SO important!SeatingSingapore Airlines Business Class has the biggest airplane seats I’ve ever seen in my life. In fact, they are officially the widest business class seats in the world. These ultraluxe, Scottish leather armchairs transform from oversized seats into an impressive seventy-eight-inch, fully flat bed.Singapore Airlines has been flaunting its new seat positions: the Lazy Z and the Sundecks. You can chill with your feet up like you are poolside or have your weight totally centered and balanced, La-Z-Boy style.These lush seats have got a side console that sits above the armrest so you can keep your laptop handy and connected to eXport, HDMI, and USB ports.EntertainmentWith more than 1,000 movies, television shows, music, and games, KrisWorld will ensure that you don’t run out of things to do. Get the free SingaporeAir mobile app before you go.If you are a multitasker, this app is a dream.You can watch a movie on your seat monitor and keep browsing for other options on the app. With a 15.4-inch LCD screen and a comfy seat to enjoy, you’ll feel more like you are vegging out at home than sitting in a plane.Food and DrinkWith top chefs from all over the planet, Singapore Airlines Business Class offers food and beverages above and beyond your average airline food. With seasonal ingredients and amazing fusions, this is a meal you’ll actually look forward to chowing down on.I’ll be honest, I wasn’t that impressed with the food. For being the “top” business class airline, I did expect the food to blog me away and I was left a bit uninspired.However, they do have the Book the Cook feature which I didn’t take advantage of and could have made all the difference. Reserve your seared Chilean bass, peppered fillet mignon, fresh pasta, delicious stir fry, or whatever you are into, and have it hot and fresh when you arrive.HELPFUL TIP: If you have been looking to get a travel reward credit card, I recommend applying for one before a big trip or purchase. Some of the biggest benefits are earning points to use for free flights and hotels. Plus, many cards offer additional points when making travel-related purchases. Some cards also offer travel protection when you pay for a trip with the card.My personal favorite is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (for frequent travelers) or the Chase Sapphire Preferred (if you’re just starting out)! Check out my favorite travel reward credit cards!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/mermaid-nails-jill-lovers-tokyo/,Mermaid Nails at Jill & Lovers in Tokyo,Japan,"Obsessed with Harajuku culture? You might be soon! If you aren’t already inspired by Japan’s coolest trend, it’s time to change things up.While head-to-toe Harajuku style might hard to pull off over the age of eighteen, there are some incredibly cool elements to this unique look that anyone can do. The best way to add a little Harajuku to your style is with nail art, and that’s what I got during my latest adventure in Japan.Here are my mermaid nails from Jill & Lovers in Tokyo! Harajuku CultureWhile it’s pretty new to the international stage, Harajuku culture is actually more than seventy years old. It took off in Japan right after WWII when American soldiers and their families opened up Western-style shops around Japan.Japanese young people were fascinated by American trends. They gradually transformed their favorite Western looks into a uniquely Japanese style. The fashionistas behind the trend started calling themselves the Harajuku Tribe based on the area where they lived.Generations of young people have pushed this culture forward throughout the years. Still centered in the Harajuku area, the culture is ever changing.The Biggest TrendsReady to try out some Harajuku culture? While it’s a massive mashup of different influences, there are a few core concepts.You’ll hear a lot about Lolita style, and it’s not what you think. Inspired by Victorian-era trends, Lolita style is all about petticoats and corsets. Gyaru, which is Japanese for girl, is based around the typical California-girl style. To add a bit of edge, Harajuku lovers are all about adding punk elements to create a dynamic style.Another big trend is Ganguro. Meaning black face, this look centers on fake tans, orange or silver hair, white eye shadow and major false lashes. Yamanba and Manba take that oompa-loompa-at-the-disco look to the next level. Harajuku Nail ArtTokyo nail art is some of the most intricate and impressive of anywhere I’ve ever seen. And there’s no better place to get yours done than at Jill & Lovers Harajuku.These ladies have the illustrious title of the “#1 shop for unnecessary nail design in Harajuku,” and I fell in love with them while I was in Tokyo.Jill & Lovers Harajuku has a massive variety of trends that you’d have never dreamt of and an ultra professional staff.

https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-visit-tokyo/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Tokyo,Japan,"Japan has been on the list of my “top countries to visit” for as long as I can remember. Well, I guess I crossed my fingers hard enough, because I got to explore the magical city of Tokyo this summer!I traveled to Tokyo with one of my best friends, Tiana, for the ultimate girls’ getaway. We explored the quirky Harajuku District– eating fairytale cupcakes, spending WAY too much time in photo booths and even trying rainbow spaghetti. It is definitely the center of Japanese fashion and youth culture, and I love that “growing up” here is totally optional!You also HAVE to check out the endless boutiques and vintage shops on Takeshita Street.Once you’ve worked up an appetite, you’ve got to go to Kawaii Monster Café. This place offers a crazy, bright, once-in- a-lifetime experience. Kawaii means “cute” in Japanese culture and there really is nowhere cuter than this restaurant.Another one of my favorite districts was Shibuya (famous for the Shibuya Crossing– one of the busiest intersections in the world). During rush hour, you’ll find more than 1,000 people crossing this famous spot. Shibuya is also home to some of the best karaoke spots and restaurants in all of Tokyo. We stumbled upon the highlight of our dining experiences in Tokyo in Shibuya, Narukiyo, where we had the best sashimi I’ve ever tasted.Other highlights from the trip were the famous Robot Restaurant, an authentic Japanese cooking experience and Tsukiji Fish Market tour with Traveling Spoon, and exploring Golden Gai— an area of only a couple of blocks packed with tiny, 5-10 person capacity bars!Whether you’re looking for the ultimate destination for a girl’s trip or are planning your first trip to Japan, look no further than Tokyo.It’s by far one of the coolest cities I’ve ever been to!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-tokyo/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Tokyo,Japan,"A dizzying blend of the traditional and ultramodern, Tokyo is unlike anywhere you have ever been before. Home to anime, video games, and cutting-edge technology, Japan’s biggest city is full of 24/7 energy.Visiting Tokyo is one of the greatest adventures on the planet. If you want to have your eyes opened and your world rocked, start packing!Here are all the tips you’ll need for your first trip to Tokyo!– Use Public Transportation –Tokyo has a world-famous transport system. There’s an overground, underground, and bus system. As soon as you arrive, get a rechargeable travel card. You can buy one from any ticket machine and it works on every bus and train.The local guides and maps to the transportation system are usually in English but can be confusing at first. I’d definitely recommend getting your portable Wi-Fi device before you try to get around the city. Google Maps makes navigating the train system easy.It will tell you exactly where to go and even give you the price of your journey.Etiquette on transportation is important in Japan, so it’s good to have an idea of what to expect before you go. The subway is one place where you’ll definitely want to respect the norms.When you are traveling, keep your phone on silent, and don’t answer calls. If you are sitting down, be ready to give up your seat to young children, pregnant women, elderly people, and the disabled.In Tokyo, these courtesies aren’t just polite, they are actually the law.– Eat Slurp Soba –Do as the locals do! Soba noodles are cheap, delicious, and traditional. You’ll find soba noodle restaurants all over the place offering a crazy selection of different varieties of soba noodles. Get experimental and find your new fave.– Sanitation –Public garbage cans are incredibly rare, and littering is even more unusual. Japanese women have zero qualms about tucking trash away into their bags for safe keeping. Stash a baggie in your purse so that you can safely tuck away garbage until you find a place to throw it away.Paper towels and napkins are other rarities.Japanese women often carry a small hand towel in their bags to keep things fresh when they are on the go.– Download a QR Code Reader App –You’ll find QR codes all over the city and some of them are really useful. Have a QR Code reader app ready to go so you can snap shots whenever you need to.– Language –You’ll find quite a few English speakers around central Tokyo but having a translation app is still very handy. The farther you are from the center of the city, the more likely you are to need translation help. Learning a few simple sentences will go a long way too.Japanese is a really interesting language, so try to master some key phrases before your trip.– Get a Wi-Fi Device –One of the most valuable things you can have in Tokyo is a pocket Wi-Fi device since very few places offer free Wi-Fi; Japanese people use 4G or hotspots provided by their ISPs.I rent a Skyroam device for all my trips– it’s a lifesaver!For around eight dollars a day, you can have a great connection and all the data you need to navigate, check messages, and post your pics to social media. They’re also offering a $99/month unlimited Skyroam connection at the moment!– Reading Maps –Opt for a bilingual map. People on the street are always ready to help but showing them a map that’s only in English can make it complicated to get directions. English/Japanese maps are easy to come by and can be really valuable when you’re lost.– Public Restrooms –Public bathrooms are common in Tokyo. Most of them are well-equipped and Western style. However, come prepared for the possibility of having to use a squat toilet or needing to supply your own toilet paper.Having a stash of tissue or wipes in your bag is priceless on these occasions.– Keep to the Left –Japanese people drive and walk on the left. When you are on public stairways and escalators, you’ll notice people always standing on the left side. Go with the flow so you don’t disturb foot traffic.– Don’t Tip –Tipping isn’t expected or even accepted in Japan. If you leave extra money on the table at a restaurant, your server might chase you down the street to return it.In fact, paying extra could even be considered an insult so just avoid it.– BONUS TIP –The only cash-dispensing ATM’s you will find are in 7-Eleven stores, and they dispense minimum $100 USD (but in Japanese yen). These ATMs allow you to withdraw cash by credit and debit cards issued outside of Japan, including Visa, Plus, Mastercard, Maestro, Cirrus, American Express, and JCB cards and provide an English menu!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-moving-to-tokyo/,The Ultimate Guide to Moving to Tokyo,Japan,"Life in Japan seems all fun and games, with the popularization of anime, video games, and cutting-edge technology. Tokyo might as well be the center of the universe, in terms of what it has to offer its inhabitants. If you come from out of the country, however, it can take some time and effort to adjust.Here’s a guide from our Expat Travel Expert, Wailana, on moving to Tokyo!(source)What to ExpectTokyo is a bustling metropolis—lights, movement, heat, energy—life here moves quickly and there’s always something going on 24/7. You’ll wander the city for years and never touch most of it.It can be a bit overwhelming. Luckily, the train system is so awesome you can zip somewhere else to enjoy a smaller town or the rural countryside. Take a trip out to temple-laden Kamakura, or to the green city of Nara.Societal Norms: The society is heavy with cultural cues and social behavioral norms, so by adopting some of these into your everyday life, you can improve your relationships with the locals.Respect elders. Bow when you meet someone. Learn a few standard phrases of politeness. These little gestures can go a long way.For a country that spent much of its history in isolation, there is still a fair share of xenophobia. The best thing you can do in these cases is to accept your status as a foreigner—with all that entails—and whatever you do, remain polite.Although less frequent, there is still the existence of the “well, you’re a foreigner so it can’t be helped” card, an unspoken assumption that you are a foreigner and therefore you can’t understand a social situation or a Japanese sentence. Whether this infuriates you or you play it to your advantage, that’s up for you to decide.Food: The food in Tokyo is some of the best in the world. Nowhere else will you enjoy a Michelin-star level of sushi and sashimi, at least not the proper Japanese way.Try some unusual local dishes while you’re here—natto (fermented soybeans), okonomiyaki (the Japanese answer to pizza), takoyaki (octopus balls), dried crabs—if you don’t like them, you’ll at least have a story for later!Cost of Living: Tokyo is expensive, but there are ways to keep costs down to a minimum. Go shopping at the hyaku-en (100 yen) store, buy healthy lunches at the wholesale market, cook at home, ride a bicycle around town, shop for clothes at secondhand shops.(source) Visas and ImmigrationDepending on your status, there are a number of ways to start your life in Japan. If you have savings of over 30 million yen per month for the duration of your stay, great! No questions asked, simply apply at your nearest Embassy. For those of us who don’t have such resources, there are basically three ways to stay in the country: Get a Job: In order to apply for a work visa, you’ll need official sponsorship from a company willing to hire you. Work visas can be granted anywhere from 4 months to 5 years. The easiest work to find as a US citizen is teaching English! Tap into sites like GaijinPot and O-Hayo Sensei, which list positions for native English speakers. If you have some ESL qualifications, so much the better: CELTA, TESOL, any tutoring experience won’t hurt your chances. Even if you don’t like your job you can quit and look for another, because you can be jobless with a work visa for up to 90 days. The key factor to finding a job is that it comes with visa sponsorship—but only a few companies will hire from abroad, so keep a lookout for those that do. Finding a non-teaching job is certainly less common, but if you have the right qualifications (or you are fluent in Japanese) you can give it a shot. Having a tight, impressive CV will improve your chances.Enroll as a Student: If you have been accepted as a student in a credited school, you’ll need a letter of enrollment as well as a bank statement or proof of scholarship that proves you can manage yourself financially for the time you are studying abroad. Note that you’re not allowed to work unless you get special permission from immigrations (and then only 20 hours per week are permitted).Get Married: Alternatively, you can marry a citizen or permanent resident of Japan. This grants you a spouse visa, granted in periods of 6 months to 5 years.Take note that you should apply for your permit before you leave home. Regardless of your visa type, you’ll have to submit several documents to the Embassy — Passport, visa application form, photograph, and certificate of eligibility (an official letter of sponsorship from a job or a school). It might take a few weeks to a few months to process, so make the arrangements well before your flight. As soon as you arrive in Japan at the airport with your papers in hand, officials will issue a residence card for you. Always keep this in your wallet. This card is necessary to open a bank account, obtain a cell phone, or convert a driver’s license. Within the first two weeks of your arrival, you need to register your address with the nearest city or ward office. As long as you are still employed or enrolled at the end of your visa, renewal of your permit is relatively painless, and takes only a few weeks maximum to process. You may stay in the country while it’s being processed, even if your previous permit expires. (source)AccommodationsIf you have a work visa, you can get the company sponsoring you to arrange your accommodation, but I generally advise against this, because a) monthly rent is usually expensive, b) you have no control over where you live, and c) it puts you in a difficult position should you ever want to quit.Better yet, find temporary accommodation, a share house, hostel or Airbnb, until you can get on your feet.There are many benefits to moving in a share house when you first arrive. Share houses are typically month-to-month contracts, utilities included, with only a down payment of the first month’s rent. They also often come fully furnished with bed, closest and desk.There are downsides however, especially if you’re someone who values privacy—the kitchen, showers and common rooms are typically shared. You can’t choose the people who share with, and there’s generally less personal space.In this way it’s more like a dorm building than an apartment. But then again it’s a fantastic way to meet fellow expats. I recommend staying with a shared house at least for the first few months until you are stable enough to rent.(source)Getting AroundTraversing Tokyo for foreigners is relatively simple, if you learn the basics. The train system is extensive and one of the best in the world. The Yamanote Line runs in a loop around central Tokyo, and from there you can transfer to a number of smaller lines.You’ll want to pick up a Suica pass—a small, rechargeable card that grants access to the train and bus systems—plus they work all over Japan. Downtown the Tokyo Subway Navigation app, it works offline and is useful for charting your route.Although many signs and announcements are in Japanese and English, it doesn’t hurt to know some basic kanji. Trains are classified into speed and can be identified by their kanji: Local (普通), Rapid (快速), and Express (急行). The local train stops at every station on the line, the rapid skips some, and the express skips even more. One of my first days in Tokyo, though I was familiar with these kanji, I failed to notice them and hopped on a rapid train instead of a local one, and the train of course shot past my stop!For other areas the metro doesn’t reach, there’s always the bus system—though it is a bit more confusing to the foreigner who might not know any Japanese. Bikes are another great way to get around, it can be more convenient and less annoying than pubic transit.Familiarize yourself with the rules of the road: don’t cycle with an iPod or phone, and keep to the left side of the road.(source)About the Expat CommunityThe expat community in Japan is HUGE. With a bustling metropolis like Tokyo, there’s people from all over—from South African diplomats to British ESL teachers to Vietnamese barbers. All in all, there are about 2 million expats. And how does one meet some of them?Meetup is a great app to find English-speaking groups who meet up for an after-work beer. Try to make connections with like-minded people (bloggers, for instance) before you arrive, so it’s easy to meet up once you’re there.Join an international nomikai, or drinking party, to meet other expats as well as Japanese who want to practice their English.Other Helpful TipsLanguage: Learn some Japanese before you go—it tends to impress easily!Etiquette: Remember to take off your shoes before you enter the home. I’m from Hawaii, where this is a norm so it wasn’t a problem for me, but for many Americans it can be surprising.Gaijin Trap: Be wary of the gaijin trap—a halfway point of culture shock in which you criticize your host country too much, leading to an unhealthy, negative spiral—and criticizing anything non-Japanese too much.Just because you are living in Japan doesn’t mean you have to go into full-blown immersion: for example, refusing to hang out with people just because they’re non-Japanese. In fact, this can lead to cultural burn-out in the long run.Strike a balance and go out for pizza once in a while and you’ll find adjusting to be so much easier."
https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-going-on-an-african-safari/,The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari,Kenya,"One of the best things about living in Cape Town is having the opportunity to explore the depths of Africa. Even after being based here for years, I still jump at the chance to explore the great outdoors. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, there is nothing more captivating than experiencing exotic wildlife in their natural habitat.As completely worthwhile as it is, planning an African safari is a massive undertaking.Where is the best place to go? When is the prime time to spot animals? What should I pack for a safari? You guys have been asking me tons of questions about safaris and I’m ready to cover ‘em all!Ready to get wild? Here is your ultimate guide to going on an African safari.    The Best  Time to Go on SafariImagine the United States, China, India, and most of Europe combined together into one whopping mass of land. That incredible supercontinent will give you an idea of how big Africa is! In fact, Africa is four times larger than the continental US.Of course, if someone asks the best time to visit the US, it would depend on countless factors. The same is true of Africa. This diverse continent has snowy mountains, vast deserts, lush grasslands, and dense forests.You can have a completely different experience at different times of the year.The great thing about the sheer size of Africa is that you can visit any time of the year. Check out my post on the best time to go on safari in Africa for a full month-by-month guide to help you figure out where to go and when.What to Pack for a SafariTypically when it comes to packing, less is more. After all, you can almost always just pop down to the local shopping center and grab whatever you need. It’s a whole different story when you are on safari, however.More of than not, you’ll have no local amenities.When you’re out on a safari, you’re fully exposed to the elements and it’s crucial to have everything that you need for the day. On top of that, luggage space is often strictly limited (if you’re taking short bush flights to get to your destination), so you need to be highly strategic.Before you go, review my breakdown on what to pack for every type of safari so you are looking and feeling fab for every unforgettable second.  How to Find a Safari LodgeFinding the right safari lodge is crucial to the success of your trip! Unlike hotels where you come and go as you like, a safari lodge is typically where you spend much of your time.In most cases, they also provide the game drive itself.It’s totally possible to come all the way to Africa and, for better or worse, only interact with your lodge. Lodges tend to encompass a huge space and offer a lot. Before you commit, do diligent research.The first step to finding the right accommodation for a safari is to choose your safari experience. From tiny tents to luxe lodges, there is something for every type of traveler.One of your early steps is deciding which kind of safari-goer you are.When you know what experience you’re after, carefully review these critical things to look for in a safari lodge.Last but certainly not least, think about the experience from the side of the animals. Safaris are about safely entering animals’ habitat without affecting a thing. Before you decide on a safari company, look for key tips on how to have an ethical animal encounter. Sadly, too many companies are focused on profit over animal welfare.Plan carefully for a cruelty-free adventure.  Gondwana Game Reserve Read More!Where I’ve StayedI have been so incredibly lucky to be able to experience some of the best safari lodges in Africa. While you are looking for inspiration, here is a country-by-country rundown of my most unforgettable places.South AfricaRovos Rail Durban Safari: Not your average safari experience, the vintage glamour of the Rovos Rail Durban Safari will transport you back in time.Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and Treehouses: I had a magical glamping experience staying at Lion Sands Ivory Lodge and Treehouses! What’s better than a night under the stars with the lions, tigers, and bears? Full disclaimer: there are no bears.Royal Malewane: Kruger National Park is widely considered to be South Africa’s top safari destination and staying at Royal Malewane brings you to the heart of it all.Gondwana Game Reserve: I had my first ever African safari while staying at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa and this place will always have a special place in my heart.  Giraffe Manor, KenyaKenyaCottar’s 1920s Safari Camp: This family-owned spot is iconic in Kenya. A night at Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp is perfect for disconnecting from the world and seeing Africa as it used to be.Mahali Mzuri: This luxury spot in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Park is an epic adventure. Owned by the famous Richard Branson, staying at Mahali Mzuri does not disappoint.Giraffe Manor: Easily one of the most Instagrammable properties in Africa, this retro-chic hotel will literally have giraffes eating out of your hand.NamibiaWolwedans Boulders Safari Camp: When it comes to Namibia, it’s all about the Wolwedans Boulders Safari Camp.

How Much to Budget for SafariSafaris aren’t cheap and you generally get you what you pay for. Before you go into sticker shock, do keep in mind that safari lodges are typically all-inclusive—so food, lodge, alcohol, and game drives are usually included. The only extra cost will be your flights.When you start considering the details of your trip, read through my guide on how much to budget for an African safari.Generally speaking, I’d highly recommend going for all-inclusive options. While you will see some cheaper options out there, be wary of any all-inclusive stay for less than $1,000 per night. The money you could save will come at the cost of your experience as well as the local ecosystem.If you want to reduce your cost, take a shorter trip. You can have an amazing two-night stay then move onto the more affordable nearby areas to explore nature without doing a formal safari.  HELL'S GATE NATIONAL PARKBest Places for SafariIf your schedule is wide open and you want to choose by destination, you’ll find options galore. Ultimately, the best place for a safari depends on your travel style.Definitely take a look at this: How to Choose an African Safari That’s Right For You!I love doing a combined city break and safari in South Africa or doing a road trip through Namibia.

Tips for Photography an African SafariSafari photography can be tricky. You are on a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and the animals sometimes just fly by in second.You have to be on your toes and know your camera well.

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-go-on-safari-in-africa/,The Best Time to Go on Safari in Africa by Month,Kenya,"Since moving to South Africa, going on safari has become one of my favorite things to do. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, the continent has such raw, natural beauty. And Africa has way more diversity than you might think!Far from a one size fits all experience, you can choose the best safari experience in Africa for you and your travel style.I’ve been lucky enough to explore the African bush a few times and experience some of the best safari destinations in Africa. I absolutely adore interacting nature this way and seeing animals in their natural habitats.Of course, if you’re a shutterbug like yours truly, an African safari is a must. You’ll be traveling through some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. African safari photography will take your snaps to the next level.Before you go, check out some of my essential reads for everything you need to know before your first African safari. I’m talking crucial info like how to budget for an African safari and what to pack for a safari.Curious as to when the best time to go on safari is? Because there are so many places to choose from and seasonal differences, I’m breaking it down by month!   Where to Go + WhyPeople often ask me about the best time to go on safari and the top places to check out. The truth is that it totally depends—an African safari is highly seasonal and location dependent.The time of year impacts migration, how wet or dry the land is, and ultimately which animals you are going to see (which is a HUGE factor).The easiest way to decide where to go on safari is to figure out when you’re going. Once you know which month you want to visit Africa, you can start researching where to go on safari.So, animal lovers, here are the best times to go on safari in Africa, based on the month!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari  JanuaryThis is the heart of the rainy season in many of the top safari hotspots—which is not necessarily a bad thing! Rain provides a lush green landscape and there are a few detours you can take to get to dry land.UgandaJanuary is actually the dry season in Uganda so the days are typically warm and sunny, though you’ll want to pack a raincoat for visits around the Volcanoes National Park. It’s prime time for gorilla trekking, which makes this one of the best times to visit Uganda, in my opinion.KenyaIt’s also the dry season in Kenya, which means that the bush and grass are all quite short. This is an advantage in seeing local wildlife. Maasai Mara is one of the most beautiful places in Africa and this is one of the best times to see it.South AfricaIt is the wet season in South Africa so pack a raincoat. Animals are on the move so you will need to be strategic to find them. Explore Sabi Sands near the Mozambique border or head down to Cape Town. Kruger National Park is an amazing safari park right outside of the city.This is especially great for a first safari because you can explore the bright lights of the big town, then simply hop in the car to go for a day trip to Kruger National Park. The animal sightings are just as impressive but there’s less need to rough it or pay for a pricey lodge out in the countryside.TanzaniaJanuary is the end of the rainy season and it is one of the premier months for spotting migrating wildebeest, zebra, and gnu, especially near the southern Ndutu and Salei plains.  UgandaFebruaryLike January, you will run into some rainy spots while exploring much of Africa in February. It is the best time of year to go on a safari though if you are interested in seeing baby animals (and who isn’t?)!South AfricaFebruary is a warm but rainy summer month in South Africa. The beloved Garden Route that runs from Mossel Bay in the west to Storms River in the east is lush and green. Make a stop in Knysna for a perfect base to explore. Make your way up to Kruger National Park to see the Big 5, or come down to Cape Town for an urban wonderland.KenyaBaby animals! Need I say more?For your very own cuteness overload, February is the time to visit Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda to see adorable little guys of all shapes and sizes. February is also good because it is a hot and dry time that will bring out big game and birds in places like Maasai Mara and Laikipia. Safaris will take you to the animals’ fave water spots where they love to hang out. Keep an eye out for wild cats too during this time!TanzaniaWhile the southern part of the country is too hot and humid for me, I love northern Tanzania during February. Almost half a million wildebeest are born in this single month in Tanzania! You will find cheetahs all over the Serengeti while you ooh and ahh at all the little babies. Best of all, the rain passes by Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya during February so it’s prime time for a visit here.Uganda and RwandaThe warm and dry weather makes perfect gorilla trekking conditions! Just be aware that the later you go in February, the more likely you are to run into rain, especially near Volcanoes National Park.Helpful Tip:While I’d recommend seeing as much of Africa as you can during your trip, this isn’t the time to visit Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Namibia if you’re interested in seeing big game. These areas are pretty quiet in February.  MarchFrankly, March isn’t the best time of year for a safari in the majority of Africa. That said, if March is your only available time, there are definitely a couple of places where you can make it work.TanzaniaThe rainy reason is just starting and migration is at its peak. I would highly recommend checking out the Serengeti during the famous Great Migration. It’s also a chance to see the little newborn wildebeests discovering their new world right alongside you.South AfricaThe weather is still good in South Africa in March and it’s a dream season to drive along the renowned Garden Route. It is also a perfect time to visit Kruger and Sabi Sands, though you’ll want to avoid areas close to Botswana and Zambia as they’re both pretty likely to be rained out.  RIVER CRUISE AT MENO A KWENA, BotswanaAprilApril showers bring May…tigers! The continent is washed over in April. Vegetation is ultra lush, which is beautiful but makes it harder to see the animals.Since water is plentiful, animals don’t need to congregate in any particular watering hole because water is all over. This can make animals hard to see in many countries. There are a few key spots that are at their best in April though.BotswanaWith the rivers full to the brim, this is the perfect time to explore the Okavango Delta and visit Victoria Falls. Located between Zimbabwe and Zambia, a trip to Victoria Falls is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Africa. While it’s not peak season for a game viewing safari, this is the best time to visit Botswana if you’re looking to save a bit of cash.Botswana is actually one of the most expensive safari destinations, so traveling outside of peak season can be a major perk for your wallet. Best of all, you can see the incredible raw beauty of the Okavango Delta flooded (a bucket list item for any safari lover!).NamibiaThe wet season is ending in April and Namibia is once against bathed in sun. If you are ready for the ultimate road trip, add a drive across Namibia to your things to do in Africa list.South AfricaWelcome to autumn in South Africa! As cooler and drier weather comes, trees lose their leaves and it’s easy to spot the local wildlife. Local game reserves are a perfect destination.TanzaniaIn April, I would highly recommend checking out the northern parks of Tanzania. It is a top time to go on a safari and you will be able to avoid peak season, which runs from July to October.  MayJust as things are warming up in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a chill in the air south of the equator. When it comes to the best time to go on safari, this simply isn’t prime time for most of Africa—with one spectacular exception though!MozambiqueJust before the peak season, Mozambique is at its best. The afternoons get into the high 80s while the afternoons rarely fall below 50 degrees. The skies are clearing up as the rainy season ends. Hotspots like Gorognosa and Niassa are prime for exploration.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Mozambique   Namibia JuneJune is the turning point of the year in Africa. Goodbye, rain. Hello, sunshine! June is one of the best times of year to go on safari in Africa in so many diverse spots around the continent.South AfricaIn South Africa, you’ll find two distinctly different seasons in June. In the northern part of the country, things are drying out. It’s peak game viewing time up there and the days are sunny. In the south, near Cape Town, however, it’s the absolute rainiest time of the year.While it’s not great for a safari, it is the best time of year to see the whale migration in the Southern Cape. Explore the delta as herds head to Chobe and then make their way over to Linyanti.NamibiaThe weather is dry and relatively warm. As the natural sources of water are diminished by the arid season, it is easy to spot animals hanging out together at local water sources. Be sure to plan ample time to explore Etosha National Park.ZimbabweThe peak season here is from June to September. During June, the landscape is drying out. You know by now that dry weather means animals partying at the local watering hole! June is also a dream month to visit Victoria Falls (and I’d highly recommend flying over to see the falls while they’re at their most powerful of the year).  OKAVANGO RIVER CRUISEJulyDry season is in full swing and you will be spoilt for choice all around the continent. This is peak travel time and easily the best time of year for a safari in the majority of the best spots in Africa.It’s nearly impossible to choose the best place to go in July—but you better hurry!This is the most popular time of year and things sell out fast. Of course, that means that trips come at a premium so your options for a budget safari are pretty limited.TanzaniaSerengeti National Park is a massive draw during July. The Great Migration in northern Serengeti will truly blow your mind. Elephants are migrating in Tarangire while spots like Katavi, Selous, and Ruaha offer something a bit more off the beaten path.South AfricaMore of the same from June, the weather in the north of South Africa is getting even drier and spotting wildlife is getting even easier. Meanwhile, the Cape is still rained out but with perfect whale spotting conditions.BotswanaJuly is definitely one of the best times of year to visit Botswana. Famous areas like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and Linyanti are flawless. The Delta is gloriously flooded and animal spotting is as likely as ever. Just note that animals have mostly left the Pans and Kalahari area.KenyaThe Great Migration is running its way through Maasai Mara during July and August. We are talking wildebeest and zebra galore! It is an amazing time but definitely busy. Take your time and do some research while picking a camp so you don’t end up anywhere too crowded when safari madness sweeps the world.  Kenya Ultimate GuideAugustAnother unbeatable time of year for an African safari! The weather is still dry for a bit longer and ideal across the continent in many spots.KenyaYou haven’t missed the Great Migration yet so get to Maasai Mara to see a draw-dropping movement of wildebeests and zebras. Be sure to spend at least part of your safari at the river where you can see these guys zigzagging between crocodiles as they make their way across the river.TanzaniaYou can also check out dramatic river crossing in Tanzania, especially in Lamai and Kogatende. Iconic spots like the Serengeti National Park are at their best as the elephant migration takes over the country (around in Tarangire). While tourism is at its peak, you can still check to find tranquil spots around Selous, Ruaha, and Katavi.BotswanaIf you want to see majestic elephants, look no further.The Chobe and Linyanti area has more of these massive cuties than anywhere else on the continent. The Okavango Delta is still flooded as well and looks incredible at this time of year. Just note that the Pans and the Kalahari are largely empty at this time of year as the local wildlife vacations abroad.ZimbabweAlso in its peak season, Zimbabwe is at the top of its game for safaris. Adventure lovers will want to make sure to hop over to Victoria Falls after the game spotting for more heart-stopping fun. The water is a bit lower at this time of year and it’s white water rafting season.NamibiaFor more unforgettable animal sightings, get to Etosha then make your way out to the Skeleton Coast to soak in the otherworldly beauty. Just LOOK at my latest pics and you won’t be able to wait another minute to see this epic country.  KenyaSeptemberGo big or go home in September! During the heart of the dry season, you are going to see the biggest of big game animals at top spots around the continent.TanzaniaDuring the Great Migration, Tanzania is at its peak with constant river crossings and elephants thundering through. Of course, the Serengeti National Park is an essential destination. For river crossings, the northern part of the park around Lamai and Kogatende is the place to be. To get up close and personal with the majestic elephants of Tanzania, be sure to plan time for Tarangire National Park.BotswanaSeptember is the best time to visit Botswana. Famous spots like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and the Linyanti are truly at their very best. Chobe and Linyanti is the elephant capital of Africa for the time. Meanwhile, the Okavango Delta is flooded and sparkling with beauty. While the whole country is beautiful, steer clear of the Pans and Kalahari areas, which many of the animals have left behind for the season.ZimbabweDry season is upon Zimbabwe and the conditions in the country couldn’t be better. After most of the tourists have gone home, all of the animals are gathering at their watering holes, and the country is ripe for exploration.NamibiaGet to Etosha peaks for unbeatable game viewing then make your way over to the Skeleton Coast for some of the most gorgeous scenery in all of Africa.MozambiqueTourists are clearing out as summer comes to an end (but the weather is still gorgeous!) in Mozambique. If you are looking to squeeze in a beach break during your African safari, look no further than this coastal retreat.KenyaOf course, it’s all about the Great Migration in Maasai Mara. This is one of the best times to visit Kenya. When you want to get away from the tourist hotspots, check out the quieter regions of the north. Game viewing is equally impressive up there but you’ll be a bit more off the beaten path.OctoberThe dry season is coming to an end in October but you can still find prime conditions across the country before the rain really starts to roll in.ZimbabweThe bush is still quite dry around Zimbabwe so animals are chilling around the most popular water sources. While the weather is still quite hot, it’s bearable. Be sure to plan time for Ruaha and Katavi where the tourists have cleared out and big game have taken their place. In the north, the Tarangire area is filled with elephants while the Serengeti is seeing many river crossings.KenyaPrices are lower than usual while the game is still active and visible. If you are looking for a budget safari option that will knock your hiking boots off, this one’s for you.TanzaniaStill in its peak season, it is warm but not crazy hot in Tanzania. To escape the heat of places like Zimbabwe, wildlife is coming to the permanent watering hole they know and love in Tanzania.  MEERKAT SAFARI IN BOTSWANANovemberThe southern side of Africa is into the rainy season. Humidity and heat (don’t forget it’s summer down here!) make it pretty uncomfortable in a lot of places. There is a minor East African migration for serious safari-goers in Liuwa Plain National Park but, otherwise, many of the popular spots are a washout.TanzaniaIf you stick to the northern part, you will see migrating herds making their way across the country despite the weather.BotswanaWhile it is not your traditional African safari fare, the skies above Botswana are alive with action. Birds are migrating through the Okavango Delta while dramatic storms sweep in for stunning photo ops.Although the weather is hot, it is at least a dry heat with the exception of passing storms. Since it’s not peak season, you can grab a major deal on when camps are offering up to 40 percent off their peak rates.DecemberWant to decorate the yuletide bush and ring in the new year under the stars? East Africa is the best place to be for a winter break in Africa. Across the regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the weather is dry and the animals are active.KenyaThe rainy season in Kenya is coming to an end in the middle of December. The scenery is lush and emerald but that makes it a bit tougher to spot game. It’s still worth it though! The Maasai Mara, Laikipia, and Lewa areas are drop-dead gorgeous at the end of the year.TanzaniaThe Serengeti and Ngorongoro area beautiful at this time of year but across the country rainfall will be making it a bit harder to spot game. Stick to the Northern Circuit to see the locals celebrating Christmas in their own way.OverallSo, my fellow explorers, that is all you need to create your perfect safari. I know there are a TON of options. Every month offers something a bit different.The bottom line is: just go! Africa, as a whole, is certainly one of the most underrated travel destinations on the planet. My best advice is to simply find a place that intrigues you and go for it.For me, the most dynamic and interesting countries in Africa for a safari are Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and, of course, my adopted home of South Africa.Note, while there are other places I could have included on this list, I mainly stuck to the ones with my opinion of “best experiences.”But I’d love to hear your opinions and what places you would suggest during certain times of the year below!"

The city is notorious for its traffic jams, and not everyone obeys the rules of the road.Giraffe Manor is only a 30-minute drive from the airport, and Uber rides are quite an affordable way to get around. If possible, try to book a flight that lands in the morning or early afternoon so you have enough time to soak up the full Giraffe Manor experience!Once you arrive, you’ll check into one of Kenya’s top hotels—Giraffe Manor is famous around the world for its herd of endangered Rothschild giraffes that often peek their heads through the hotel windows in search of a snack.While it is a luxury hotel, having breakfast with giraffes is a once in a lifetime experience!Read More: Staying at Giraffe Manor in Kenya   Hell's Gate National ParkDay 2-3: NairobiHead back to NairobiAfter spending a night at Giraffe Manor, head back to Nairobi and discover Kenya’s bustling metropolis.

While getting here requires a little effort, I highly recommend staying a few nights.Located 150 miles from Nairobi, you can take a small bush flight from Wilson Airport to get there, or you can hire a driver. If you choose to fly, keep in mind that there is limited space on the plane and there is a strict baggage weight limit!Mahili Mazuri is made up of 12 luxurious tents, and the daily rate is all-inclusive for food, drinks, and even laundry. There’s also a beautiful infinity pool and a lounge area with a fireplace.You can go on game drives twice a day. For me, the night drives were truly magical and one of the highlights of my trip. The camp also offers customized tours and private hires which are worth looking into if you’re after something more bespoke.End of your day in the bush at the on-site Nasaro spa!Lastly, no trip to Kenya would be complete without a visit to the Masaai community, only 10-minutes away from Mahili Mzuri.

From the Indian Ocean coastline to the sweeping savannah to the famous Great Rift Valley, this beautiful country has it all.A dream come true for nature lovers, there are more 45 national parks and reserves, mountains, and outdoor adventures at every turn.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-mahali-mzuri-in-kenya/,Staying at Mahali Mzuri in Kenya,Kenya,"Thank you to Mahali Mzuri for hosting me during my stay. As always, thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own.Mahali Mzuri means “beautiful place” in Swahili, but the phrase hardly does justice to what you’ll see at Mahali Mzuri in Kenya. This luxury safari camp is part of the private Olare Motorogi Conservancy, located in Kenya’s Maasai Mara National Park.Easily one of the most breathtaking places in Africa, the camp is owned by Sir Richard Branson. This guy has been to every corner of the planet and has properties in some of the most exclusive, enchanting spots. Of course, I couldn’t resist checking out the remote African area that caught his eye.Here’s my experience staying at Mahali Mzuri in Kenya.Getting ThereThe best way to get to the camp is to fly into Wilson Airport in Nairobi. From there, Mahali Mzuri is 150 miles (240 km) away.If you don’t mind small planes and want to be a bit closer, the Olare Orok airstrip is serviced by Safarilink Aviation, Air Kenya, and Governors’ Aviation. You can also check out the Mara North airstrip, which is an hour’s drive from the camp, and you can find flights there from Safarilink Aviation or Air Kenya.This flight, unfortunately, had a seriously small baggage weight allowance. I had to leave behind my tripod and a few other items, so be sure to plan in advance so you don’t have to shuffle your gear at the airport.Read More: What to Pack for an African SafariThe HotelNamed the favorite safari camp by Condé Nast Traveler, Mahali Mzuri in Kenya is a twelve-tent luxury safari camp. It only accepts a couple of dozen guests at any time and is all-inclusive of food, drinks, and even laundry — so you get the VIP treatment at every step.Offering a cozy lounge with a fireplace and an infinity pool, the main tent is the perfect place to unwind. It’s also the place to be if you’re hungry! The area features an over-size communal dining table for sharing safari tales and admiring the view.Luxury TentsThere are six luxury tents on either side of the main tent. You can choose from ten different suites with king or twin beds. If you’re ready to treat yourself, you also have the option of a couple of upgraded four-post king bed tents.And trust me; this place puts the glam in glamping. The tents impress at every turn, but you’ll hardly notice your room when you’re taking in the ground-to-sky vista of this truly awe-inspiring land.Food + DrinkWith top-notch in-house chefs, Mahali Mzuri is the best place to sample the greatest pan-African dishes. From bush BBQs to champagne picnics to your classic international faves, the camp has you covered.All meals and nonalcoholic drinks are included in the cost of your stay, and they’re great at dealing with any special dietary needs, so just let them know in advance.Each day starts with travelers meeting up at the communal table to chat about the day’s adventures while digging into the continental buffet of hot dishes and fresh bread.Mahali Mzuri offers lunch on the main deck à la carte or at the pool; and for dinner, you can chat at the communal table, find a private table in the bush, or head back to your room to chill with some room service.ActivitiesMahali Mzuri offers twice-daily game drives, which were the highlight of my experience. The sights on this once-in-a-lifetime excursion were absolutely incredible. I saw something new every time, and the night drives were magical.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-cottars-1920s-safari-camp-in-kenya/,Staying at Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp in Kenya,Kenya,"Since moving to South Africa, I’ve fallen in love with safaris. When it comes to safaris in Kenya, it’s all about the Cottar family. These guys are known as the “first family” of the safari business. In fact, it’s been almost 100 years since the family started its safari company, and it has earned ample bragging rights since then.The Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp has 2 accommodation options, the luxurious Bush Villa and beautiful, unique tents, within the 1920s-themed camp. I love old-time charm and another African safari was on my list, so I was invited to check out the camp for a few nights.Here’s my experience at Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp!Getting to Cottar’s 1920s Safari CampThe easiest way to get to the Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp in Kenya is by the Cottar’s private airstrip, which is just a ten-minute drive from the camp. Two airlines, Fly 540 and East African Safari Air Express, fly here twice a day during the low season and three times a day during the high season.You’ll also find a range of airlines that fly into Keekorok airstrip, which is a one-and-a-half-hour drive from the Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp.The HistoryOne of the trademarks of Cottar’s Camp is its proximity to the Maasai community, a famous local tribe that is seen by many as the embodiment of traditional Kenyan culture. While they’ve been well exposed to modern life, the people of the Maasai tribe have remained true to their traditional way of life. Visiting the local Maasai village was definitely one of the highlights of my visit to Kenya.I spent four days with a Maasai guide who told us tales of his childhood growing up in the bush.He shared so many of the beautiful lessons that the Maasai pass down through generations. On the morning of our departure, he took us to visit the village where he grew up. Children approached us in curiosity, smiling as they saw their likeness in the LCD displays of our cameras. We were welcomed into their humble homes and shown a much simpler way of life, which they hold dear.It was a profound experience that I will never forget.The Safari CampThe Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp is set on 6,000 acres of gorgeous landscape. There are two main tents there dedicated to eating, drinking, and being merry. They are the places to connect with other travelers or just unwind with a good book.Far from roughing it, this luxe camp has a swimming pool and spa area that will keep you feeling pampered throughout your glamping experience.I stayed in the Bush Villa, which is essentially a private, luxury home within the camp.It has a breathtaking view over the savannah and the Olderikesi Hills. Guests of the villa have a staff of 8 at their service, and can enjoy privately guided game drives, night game drives, bush walks, swimming and fishing. The villa was seriously impressive and overwhelming (in a good way!). It is over 10,000 square feet in size, and features a large living room, dining room, a magnificent viewing deck, and 5 en-suite bedrooms, all with stunning views.In addition to the villa, there are ten tents in the camp– a deluxe honeymoon tent, five double tents, and four family suites. They all have en suite bathrooms and feel ultra-private.In my opinion, this would be a great option for larger families or groups that want to travel together. The family tents hold 2 ensuite bedrooms with a shared veranda, a dining room and a living room with fireplaces! I loved that the entire camp is situated in a way that the tents are private and quiet, whether for the honeymooners or families with children.While it’s a good place to disconnect, you don’t actually have to unplug. There is Wi-Fi in the camp, and you’ll find a good phone signal in many spots. There’s also a cell phone available in the office that you can use anytime if you’re having trouble getting connected.ConservationIt’s not just about tourism for the Cottars. The family has set up the Cottars Wildlife Conservation Trust to help preserve local wildlife habitats while protecting animals from poachers. The money that you spend at the safari camp helps to support the Cottar’s 6,000-acre Olderikesi Wildlife Conservancy that is a refuge for threaten Kenyan animals.Activities & SafarisLocated just under one mile from the Maasai Mara game reserve, this is the perfect spot to take in the incredible nature and culture of the region.The Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp organizes day and evening drives to the Masai Mara game reserve so that you can see the animals in their natural habitat. There are also guided bush walks, river swimming, and fishing excursions as well as cultural visits with the local Maasai people.More InformationHotel: Cottar’s 1920s Safari CampLocation: Maasai Mara National Reserve, KenyaAccommodation: Luxury, SafariPrice Range: $$$Thank you to Cottar’s Camp for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-giraffe-manor-kenya/,Staying at Giraffe Manor in Kenya,Kenya,"Africa is such a dynamic and fascinating continent. It’s an incredible place to soak in history and learn about the past. One especially fascinating and visually stunning period here is the turn of the twentieth century.If you want to turn back time to see Kenya the way it looked in the 1930s, you’ve got to check out The Safari Collection’s Giraffe Manor. Incredibly preserved and sitting on top of 140 acres of land, this place is like stepping into a dream.Here’s my experience staying at Giraffe Manor in Kenya!The Giraffe ManorThe Safari Collection’s Giraffe Manor has just ten rooms, which can accommodate up to twenty-five guests. While it’s definitely a luxury spot, it doesn’t have the usual fitness center and swimming pool setup– it’s not a place to do business or even think about your life in the twenty-first century.With that said, it does offer Wi-Fi, massage therapists, complimentary chauffeured vehicles, and full boarding, which includes an incredible choice of international cuisine and spirits. There are 10 rooms on property, and they each have their own stunning decor and unique personality.However, there’s usually one main reason that everyone comes to the Giraffe Manor…and that is to see the world-famous giraffes that roam the property!Getting to Giraffe ManorWhile you’ll feel like you’ve traveled back in time, Giraffe Manor is actually just over thirty minutes from Nairobi’s International Airport in the Lang’ata suburb of Nairobi, and an airport transfer is included in your rate! It’s also just a quick ride to the center of town or the Nairobi National Park.While Nairobi is a great place to visit and Kenya has a ton to offer, you are never going to want to leave Giraffe Manor.The GiraffesThere are around twenty Rothschild giraffes that wander around the space between the Giraffe Manor and the Nairobi Giraffe Centre. These guys are incredibly friendly and are very, very used to interacting with people.The giraffes will eat right from your hand, and they definitely expect you to feed them! They have so much personality that the staff actually knows each and every giraffe by sight and name and can even tell you about their personalities and ancestors.In the morning, you’ll wake to giraffes impatiently waiting for you to come to your balcony and treat them to some snacks. We woke before the sun and were giddy with excitement to see two giraffe faces peeking through our balcony.Just before sunset, high tea is served in the company of the giraffes. You can enjoy scones, cookies and cakes along with tea or a cold glass of wine as you feed the giraffes and watch as the fading Kenyan sun lights the sky on fire with pink and purple.And, the pièce de résistance of my experience at Giraffe manor was getting to enjoy breakfast with the giraffes. Guests gather in the dining room to feed the giraffes their breakfast, then enjoy a delicious “human breakfast” to themselves.I should note that the Rothschild’s giraffes are one of the most endangered subspecies of giraffe and one of the world’s most at-risk species. So while they are definitely a tourist draw, the Nairobi Giraffe Centre and The Safari Collection’s Giraffe Manor are really there to help local giraffes.The Safari Collection is all about sustainability, community, and conservation.They work to positively affect the community and wildlife while teaching the world about Kenya’s wildlife. In addition to helping these tall guys, The Safari Collection works with different organizations that help the mere 20,000 lions and 7,000 cheetahs remaining in Africa.Read More: Ethical Animal Encounters Around the World (and How to Find Them)The FoodAt the Giraffe Manor, all of your food and drinks are included so you don’t have to worry about anything. Your day starts with a breakfast that can range from a quick bite of fruit to a full, cooked breakfast.Lunch and dinner are both from a set three-course menu.One aspect of dining at the Giraffe Manor that I really liked is that you sit down and eat family style with the other guests. The food is seasonal and varied, but you can generally expect a blend of international cuisine with fine dining touches and African flair.It’s a unique place and you get to meet people from all over the globe! What You Should KnowThe property is family friendly – which is great for kids and families! However, if you’re coming for a romantic, quiet getaway, be prepared to potentially have a lot of little ones running around.At dinner, the guests were separated to families could eat together, while the adults traveling without kids ate in the formal dining room.ActivitiesThe Giraffe Sanctuary on property is a must-visit, as well as the nearby David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust — a haven for elephant and rhinos orphans.In addition to activities around the property, Giraffe Manor creates customized itineraries for each guest. It organizes everything from horseback tours to hot-air balloon rides to camel treks to visits in local villages where you can learn about the native culture.The Safari CollectionThe Safari Collection owns and operates boutique, luxury lodges and camps throughout Kenya. Their other properties are truly remarkable, and if you’re looking to extend your time in Kenya (beyond the Giraffe Manor) here’s the highlights of their other properties:Sasaab Lodge in SamburuImagine nine individual cottages situated high on the banks of the Ewaso Nyiro River– that’s Sasaab Ladge! The property commands breath-taking views across the arid landscape of the Northern Frontier District and offers a truly exceptional safari experience.Solio Lodge in LaikipiaSolio Lodge is located on a private wildlife sanctuary, tucked in the valley between the lofty slopes of Mount Kenya and the peaks of the Aberdare Mountains, directly north of Nairobi. Talk about intimacy!The Solio Reserve is also internationally recognized as the most successful private rhino breeding reserve in Kenya, so you WILL see them!Sala’s Camp in the Masai MaraLocated in the heart of the Masai Mara, Sala’s Camp is one of the most intimate and luxurious lodges in the reserve. The camp can sleep up to 18 across seven luxury tents that come with all the comforts guests could wish for including en-suite bathrooms with hot showers!This camp allows access to some of the most untouched parts in the Mara where game viewing is less likely to be shared with other tourists. Win, win! In My OpinionOne night was actually enough time to experience everything on the property. I arrived in the afternoon just before tea, and left the following day just after lunch.I’ll be honest, I was a bit worried that it would feel like a tourist trap and I’d leave feeling like I got scammed on a place that’s nothing more than an epic Instagram photo opportunity. But, that’s not the case.This place is the real deal.Giraffe Manor is literally the coolest boutique hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Aside from the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to share your breakfast with giraffes, the food, staff and accommodation truly are next level amazing.More InformationHotel: Giraffe ManorLocation: Nairobi, KenyaAccommodation: Boutique, LuxuryPrice Range: $$$Thank you to The Safari Collection for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-pack-for-an-african-safari/,What to Pack for an African Safari,Kenya,"Updated: October 2019An African safari was one of my biggest bucket list experiences and, I’ll be honest, at first, I was confronted with a completely new packing dilemma — what should I pack for a safari?I had done an elephant safari in Sri Lanka and spent a couple of days at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa, but since then, I’ve explored many game reserves throughout the top safari destinations in Africa, including Namibia, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, and have refined my safari packing list.When you’re staying in and exploring the bush, my best advice is to choose comfort above all things. But, comfortable doesn’t have to mean frumpy. A cute safari style is easily achieved with comfortable layers that will keep you warm on early morning game drives and cool during hot afternoons back at your accommodation.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for your own safari trip!My African Safari Trip DetailsLocation: KenyaTravel Dates: Late-MarchSeason: Beginning of Wet SeasonWeather: We had beautiful weather around Maasai Mara in late-March. However, March to May marks the wet season across much of Kenya.In the peak of the rainy season most other parks, especially in the highlands and the coastal parks, can be problematic with regards to heat, humidity, and continuous rain. June through October and January-February are typically high season and offer the best weather.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African SafariWhat to Expect on an African SafariDepending on the destination you’re traveling to, most game drives are in the early morning (around 5 or 6am) returning around 11am and in the evening (around 4pm) returning just after sunset.Helpful Tip: “Safaris” are typically referred to as “game drives” around Africa.Morning Game Drive: It is typically quite cold on the early morning game drives, so you’ll want to wear lots of layers and remove them as the morning sun gets warmer.When staying at Mahali Mzuri and Cottar’s Camp in Kenya, they provided hot water bags on our early morning game drives to help keep us warm as well!After exploring for a few hours, your guides might set up a bush breakfast or coffee and tea for you to enjoy before heading back. You’ll typically return to your accommodation before the heat of the day really sets in.Evening Game Drive: Your evening game drive starts when the warm sun is still up, but expect the temperature to drop quickly — especially at sunset. Most evening game drives involve a couple of hours of exploring and end with sundowners (evening drinks at sunset) and snacks before heading back.You’ll definitely want to have layers for your evening drive as it can get pretty chilly with the wind.Read More: Top Things to Look for When Choosing a Safari LodgeHow to Choose an African Safari (That’s Right for You)Luggage Requirements and Baggage AllowanceTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance if you have to take a bush flight. When traveling from Nairobi to the Maasai Mara, my flight with Safari Link had some pretty strict requirements.Unfortunately, they only allowed 15 kgs / 33 lbs inclusive of hand luggage. That meant all of my camera gear and camera bag (zoom lenses, cameras, etc.), my purse, toiletries, and clothes all had to weigh less than what I’d normally pack in a carry-on.I ended up having to leave behind a ton of clothes and even my tripod. It was a HUGE bummer but they are very strict with their policies. Fortunately, they offered free luggage storage. But, if you are connecting in multiple airports and not returning to your original airport, you’ll need to take everything with you.You also might not be allowed to use a hard suitcase if they require “soft” suitcases. That means you’ll need to use a soft bag, like a duffel bag.I always travel with this wheeled duffel bag that collapses easily!My advice, again, is to triple check your airline luggage requirements, pack LIGHT and use a soft duffel bag.What to Pack for an African SafariKeep in mind neutral, earth tones for your safari wardrobe! Dark colors will attract heat, and make sure to avoid blue or black clothing as they attract tsetse flies (if you’re in an area with them). !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Not only will it keep you warm on the sunrise and sunset game drives, but it can also be used to keep the dust out of your face.3. Sunglasses // Protect your eyes, and keep some dust out of them while you’re at it.4. Socks & Underwear // Trust me on this, bring a LOT of socks and undies. You get pretty dirty while on the game drives and you’ll want to keep changing to feel fresh.Helpful Tip: You’ll also want to bring along gloves for warmth and earplugs for the nighttime noises. *cue hippo snoring*5. ONA Camera Bag // I typically travel with the ONA Camps Bay backpack, since it can fit all of my gear, however, since I had to pack lighter for the safari, a bag like the ONA Prince Street Messenger was an awesome choice.

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-travel-to-cambodia/,The Best Time to Travel to Cambodia,Cambodia,"Cambodia is one of the few Asian countries that boasts a fairly constant climate year-round, making it a year-round destination. However, it does have two distinct seasons: wet and dry. Both of which will definitely be a factor in determining the best time to go!Whether you’re looking to bathe in the sunshine or explore the city life, there’s never a wrong time to visit the country full of culture and beautiful lush scenery. With such a wonderful climate, it’s a great place to start backpacking around Southeast Asia.Here’s my guide for the best time to travel to Cambodia!March to MaySpring in Cambodia means plenty of sunshine and a lot of humidity.Starting in March, the winter tourists have left, making it a great time to visit if you’re looking to avoid crowds and save some money. Visit Cardamom Mountain’s jungle or float down on the river on the outskirts of Kampot during these months as the weather is perfect.In April, Khmer New Year takes place and is celebrated with traditional games, rice cake baking competitions, drinking, and dancing. May is littered with public holidays from International Labour Day to the Royal Ploughing Ceremony to the Day of Remembrance.  Angkor WatJune to SeptemberThe wet season in Cambodia officially begins in June and can present certain challenges to travelers. Humidity can reach up to 80% every day and heavy downpours dampen trips to places like Cardamom and Sihanoukville. Despite this, the rains don’t last all day and if you’re willing to find shelter for a bit, it’s a great time to explore.Temperatures cool due to the rain and the countryside is lush and green.Paddies are flooded and rivers are overflowing, making it one of the best times to visit the countryside. Tonle Sap Lake swells up to five times its normal size and is home to many floating villages and flooded forests. There are also little to no crowds at Angkor Wat.  Siem Reap, CambodiaOctober to NovemberWith the rains starting to subside, October is one of the best months to visit Cambodia.The winter crowds have yet to arrive and the green landscapes are lush because of the rains. The waterfalls of Rattanakiri and Mondulkiri are overflowing, making them great swimming spots. Come November, travelers begin to flock to the country, making visits to the temples a bit longer.However, don’t let this deter you. With temperatures averaging around 77 and the sun shining, this is one of the best times to visit the islands and the coast.October and November are also filled with festivals and celebrations!In October, Pchum Benh, a Buddhist festival that celebrates the deceased ancestors, is celebrated over the course of 15 days throughout the country. Many of the main celebrations take place on the final day as the locals pay their respect to deceased family members.In Phnom Penh in November, the Water Festival aka Bon Om Touk is held. During the three-day event, which marks the beginning of the fishing season, hundreds of colorful dragon boats race across the Tonle Sap River. Millions of people from all over the country come to the festival so the capital gets quite busy.   December to FebruaryDecember means the beginning of peak season for Cambodia.The weather is undoubtedly the best, with rainfall being very rare and humidity being next to nothing. Although the Buddhist country does not typically celebrate Christmas—Christmas trees, decorations, and festive events dominate the month.Hotels are often booked up far in advance so you’ll want to do the same if you’re looking to visit in December.January is arguably even busier than December, with huge crowds at spots like Angkor Wat and Phnom Penh. To avoid crowds, visit smaller stops like Ta Prohm and Kampot.Lastly, come February, the crowds are still holding on strong. If you’re willing to fight the crowds a bit and you’re looking for a romantic Valentine’s Day getaway, consider Cambodia. The country has welcomed the Western holiday over the last few years and you will find heart-shaped balloons, giant teddy bears, and bunches of flowers everywhere you look. "

The Southeast Asian country is famous for its temples, white sand beaches, friendly locals, stunning mountains and valleys, untouched forests, and tasty street food.Several years ago, I ventured to the Temples of Angkor Wat, Phnom Penh, Kampot, and Kep, and immediately fell in love with the country. Watching the sunrise over the Temples of Angkor—the largest religious monument in the world—is a bucket list experience in itself.And let’s not forget about the pottery classes, quad bike tours, ziplining, and massages, that can be experienced in Siem Reap, the city nearest to Angkor Wat. I’d highly recommend doing a cooking class while you’re there and you definitely don’t want to miss Siem Reap’s Night Market!If you are looking to backpack around the country or simply just spend your days exploring the cities, the best time to do so is between November and May when you won’t have to worry about rainstorms ruining your plans. Just keep in mind that this is the most popular time to visit, so prices tend to go up and big attractions will have large crowds.If these photos have piqued your interest and you want to learn more about what to expect in Cambodia, check out my ultimate guide to Cambodia here!Read More:Visiting the Temples of Angkor in Two Days Recommended Tours in Cambodia!Are you heading to Cambodia in the near future or are you reliving your experience there through these photos?

https://theblondeabroad.com/jasmine-valley-eco-resort-kep-cambodia/,"Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort in Kep, Cambodia",Cambodia,"UPDATE: It is with great sadness that I share that Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort has closed down since my visit over 5 years ago. My warmest regards go out to Owen and Jasmine. Thank you for an unforgettable experience.After a short stay in Kampot, a small French-Cambodian town in the south of Cambodia, I hopped a motorbike to explore the seaside town of Kep.The drive took about 30-45 minutes as the scenery changed from endless rice fields to the lapping waves of the sea.Kep was once Cambodia’s most popular and prestigious beach destination for the French and Cambodian elite. But, after decades of civil war, the town is now haunted by the abandoned remains of old French villas. While much of Kep was destroyed during the Khmer Rouge days, some of the charm still remains.Despite Kep’s dark past, it is currently one of the fastest developing tourism areas in Cambodia.The National Park, island archipelago, beautiful beaches, fresh crab and world-famous black pepper are just some of the reasons I was determined to visit Kep.I only had a single night to spend in Kep, but made plans to stay at the Jasmine Valley Eco-Resort per the recommendation of a fellow traveler I met in Bangkok.Jasmine Valley features solar powered accommodation, healthy, home-grown foods, the sound of the Cambodian jungle, magnificent views across islands to Vietnam and the sweet fragrance of jasmine and jungle blossom.Upon arriving, I was warmly greeted by the loveliest staff. The receptionist offered me ice blended lime juice and a wet towel. I quickly checked my emails and then was showed to my room.My accommodation was an amazing ensuite mud-brick and thatch bungalow right in the middle of the Kep jungle!The owner, Owen, and his beautiful wife, Jasmine, keep the resort running using as few resources as possible. It’s the perfect “off-the-grid” accommodation for travelers to relax- completely.Inside my BungalowAn outdoor sink – literally – in the middle of the jungleI hung out around the resort all afternoon, relaxing and catching up on my last few days of blogging. I was just a few days into my first-ever solo trip and loving the independence and confidence I felt as I organized the rest of my travels from Cambodia to Vietnam and then to Bali.When deciding what to do for dinner, the owner, Owen, suggested I indulge in fresh caught crab at the restaurant Srey Kev at sunset.I took the rainforest trek from the resort up the mountainside and back down to the coast to the famous Kep Crab Market. The trek took about an hour and I can’t even begin to describe how humid it was.My clothes were absolutely drenched by the time I arrived!The View from the TrailIt took a bit of trial and error to figure out which beachside crab shack was Srey Kev (and I may never know for sure if I actually ended up there) but wherever I arrived was a little slice of heaven.The view from my table was absolutely surreal. Immediately after ordering fried crab with Kep pepper (said to be the best pepper in the world) and an ice-cold Angkor beer, I watched as a Cambodian woman walked out of the restaurant and enter, about knee deep, into the water to pull up a cage and literally fetch my dinner.I’d say that’s fresh seafood!The sunset was the most beautiful one I’d seen in my entire journey in Cambodia. The sun burnt the sky in orange and pink as rays of light reflected off the surface of the ocean and glimmered endlessly towards the horizon.The warmth of the humidity subsided as the sea air blew through my hair. For a moment, all I could hear were the crashing of small waves onto the shore.I was revived from my daydream as the smell of freshly prepared crab arrived at my table. While it may sound like an exaggeration, it was, quite literally, the best meal of my life. Literally. Life changing.(I even asked the young boy serving me for the recipe!)Two young German guys, Nicolas and Sebastian, (curious about my lack of company at dinner) asked if they could join me. After cracking open another Angkor beer, we shared stories about each others’ travels.They were on a similar trip as myself, only they are spending more time in Vietnam which I wished I could have done too. Nicolas told me about a man he ran into in Phnom Penh who spent 15 months traveling from Madrid to Cambodia by bicycle. I’m not sure how that’s even possible!I never could find his blog, so if anyone knows who they were talking about, be sure to comment below!It was an incredible (albeit short) stay in Kep, but it was unforgettable nonetheless.

We were overwhelmed by about 10 drivers, as usual, but managed to organize our trips.We said our goodbyes and I was officially on my own!I got a shared taxi. By shared, I mean SHARED! I paid to have the passenger seat while two people shared the driver’s seat and five people shared the backseat! We even hit a dog on the way in! The driver pulled over and checked to make sure his car wasn’t damaged and then we were off again.Apparently no big deal when there are hundreds of mangy dogs running around everywhere. It took about 2 hours to get to my destination, Les Manguiers guesthouse, where I planned to spend two nights.Les Manguiers, or “Mango” in English, is a little French getaway in Kampot, Cambodia that was recommended to me by a fellow hostel mate in Bangkok. She said it was a MUST for anyone traveling through Cambodia in need of a little R&R.Arriving in KampotThe driver dropped me off on the side of the road where the owner of Les Manguiers was going to pick me up. I was bombarded by little kids shouting “Hello! Hello!”I felt like a celebrity or something.It’s really remote so I assume tourists are scarce and seeing a white blonde girl is probably like seeing a unicorn. The owner picked me and my bag up on a motorcycle and we drove past rice fields along a little dirt road to the guesthouse. The area is just outside of Kampot and sits on the Kampot River.It is absolutely beautiful!Driving through the Rice FieldsThe owners are French Cambodian so it has a lot of beautiful European influence. I got my things settled in my room and enjoyed dinner in a bungalow on the river. The sunset was incredible and just as usual during my time in Cambodia, a lightening storm lit up the sky for the rest of the evening.Sunset DinnerI got an early start and had a 7 am breakfast. For $3, I got an amazing French breakfast that included: homemade organic mango, passionfruit banana, and guava jams, fresh honey, peanut butter, chocolate sauce, cheese, a baguette, fresh fruit, coffee, and orange juice.Breakfast on the RiverNeedless to say, it was delicious!Before heading out for the day, I walked the property to take in all of my surroundings. Arriving at night is always disorienting and I was so surprised with how cute everything at Les Manguiers was! There were cute Khmer style bungalows on stilts and lambs tied up to palm trees.My BungalowLes ManguiersI decided to spend my morning kayaking. The owner of Les Manguiers suggested I take a boat up the river and get dropped off with a kayak to paddle my way down through the Emerald Palace loop and to make a stop at a café on the riverside.The entire kayak trip felt like I was in the Jungle Book as I paddled through the lush tropical loop. Nobody else was around. Just me and the winding water surrounded by the tropical banks of the river.Kayaking in KampotPassing a cute little wooden bridgeThe river houses of KampotStopping to soak up some sunWhen I got to the café, it had long since been closed down but a local boy took me on a little walk and told me a bit about the history of the town. There are seashells all along the fresh water river and the boy told me about a legend his grandmother believes in that says the seashells came from the ocean that used to reach this town.After a short stop I finished my kayak trip back down to Les Manguiers and enjoyed a passion fruit and banana smoothie from the comfort of a hammock. That afternoon I visited the Epic Arts Center in town with an Australian family staying at the guesthouse.The Epic Arts Center was developed for local disabled children as a haven to establish their own community and receive artistic education. The owner’s daughter Marie led us to the center and we had a full day of arts, crafts and got to enjoy a performance by the kids.The amazingly talented boys performingWe got back to the guesthouse just before a lightening storm hit. The Australian family I met, Louise and her two children, Liam and Alice, all shared dinner together and Louise gave me some advice on traveling in Vietnam and where to stay tomorrow night in Kep. Kep is only 30 minutes from the Vietnamese border so I’ll hopefully be moving on to Vietnam the day after next.I had such a wonderful time in Kampot and can’t wait to see Kep tomorrow!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/epic-arts-disability-arts-charity-in-kampot-cambodia/,Epic Arts Cambodia: Charity for the Disabled,Cambodia,"This morning the owner at my bed & breakfast, Les Manguiers, mentioned that there would be a performance at the local center for disabled children. I wanted to attend, so after a morning of kayaking I returned to get ready for the bike ride into town.The Epic Arts Center was just a short bike ride away so the owner’s young daughter, Marie, led me and an Australian family staying at the guesthouse into town.Marie leading the way through the rice fieldsThe Epic Arts Cambodia Center was developed for local disabled children as a safe haven to establish their own community and receive artistic education.Once we arrived at the center, we participated in several workshops set up by the children, painted, learned some sign language, and even some dance routines. The local children who participate in the Epic Arts programs are taught gardening, crafting, dancing, painting, and music.Arts and crafts taught by the childrenAfter all of the workshops finished up, a snack of local fruits and nuts was served, and then the children got ready to put on a performance.A group of deaf children put on multiple modern and interpretive dance performances, while another group of deaf boys danced, juggled, and performed a comedic skit with stunts, and another group of blind children played their instruments beautifully.Snack time!I was completely awestruck during the whole performance. I was laughing and almost crying by the end of it. The children were so talented and so happy.It was very apparent that Epic Arts had created a place where the children could feel a part of something very special, with other children they could relate to, without the burdens of a society that would normally make them feel outcast.The amazingly talented boys performingIt was such a special gift to be able to witness something like this so unexpectedly. Good work Epic Arts!For more information on Epic Arts and their multiple programs in the UK, Cambodia and China visit their website: Epic Arts Cambodia"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-temples-of-angkor-wat-cambodia/,Visiting the Temples of Angkor in Two Days,Cambodia,"I arrived at my hostel in Siem Reap by way of the craziest Tuk Tuk ride ever from my night bus from Phnom Penh! After 2 weeks and oodles of noodles, while traveling in Thailand, I took full advantage of my egg and toast breakfast at the hostel.My friend Lindsay and I were absolutely ecstatic to be in Siem Reap and spend the next few days exploring Angkor Wat. We had arrived without a plan, but the hostel helped us organize a 2-day tour of Angkor Wat.Here’s my guide to visiting the Temples of Angkor in two days!Facts about the Temples of AngkorAngkor extends over 400 square kilometers and consists of more than 1000 temples!From the 9th to 15th century, Angkor was the center of the Khmer Kingdom.During the course of the 15th century, nearly all of Angkor was abandoned, except for the temple Angkor Wat, which remained a Buddhist shrine.Read More: The Ultimate Cambodia Travel GuideTips for Visiting the Temples of AngkorWhen we arrived at each temple, we would be swarmed by little kids trying to hustle us and sell us guidebooks, bracelets, etc. They were pretty relentless and at one temple Lindsay had a little girl follow her almost in tears for 10 minutes. It breaks your heart, but the guides tell you not to buy anything because the local adults give kids quotas of things to sell and it has become a huge problem. It definitely put the consequences of the effects of tourism in developing countries into perspective.Overall, I think most people would get enough sightseeing out of a two-day tour. Our days were exhausting and, by the end of the day, you had seen enough of the temples.We had great weather but I would try to plan your visit during the time of year with the best sunrise behind the Angkor Wat temple.Siem Reap is a very cool city and deserves a good exploration. Also, the night markets were better than any market I went to in Thailand – less expensive, and less touristy.Onederz Hostel Siem Reap is a great option and offers daily tours and recommendations — it has private and dorm room options. Definitely recommend their Angkor Wat tours.A three-day pass to explore the Angkor temples costs $62 USD. A single-day pass is available for $37 USD or a week-long pass can be purchased for $72 USD.Day 1 of the TourWe met a couple from Spain, Sara, and Carlos, who joined Lindsay and me on the tour. Once introduced to our guide, we all boarded 2 separate tuk-tuks, and headed to our first temple, Angkor Wat. We spent the day visiting various temples and exploring their ancient wonders.Angkor WatAngkor Wat was built between 1113 and 1150 and is the largest religious monument in the world. Half of all tourism to Cambodia is credited to international tourists wanting to visit Angor Wat.Banteay KdeiBanteay KdeiBanteay Kdei is known as the Citadel of Monks.Ta ProhmTa ProhmThe Angkor temple Ta Prohm is easily recognized (and famed) as the set for the movie Tomb Raider. Large vines cover the ruins creating a fantasy setting like something from a storybook.Ta ProhmBayonBayonBayon was one of my favorite temples. Its unique construction features a number of smiling stone faces on its towers. There’s a (not-so-secret) spot here where you can get a photo touching noses with one of the statues.BayonPhnom BakhengPhnom Bakheng is a symbolic representation of Mount Meru, home of the Hindu gods. We ended our day here and made the long climb to the top to watch the sunset. It was breathtaking!Phnom BakhengThe Hindu and Buddhist history, along with the history of the different ruling empires, felt absolutely unreal. It’s mind-blowing to think of these incredible temples as they were during the reign of their Kingdoms. Nearly a millennium ago, someone envisioned and created these wonders that we still revel in.Little girl at Pre RupDay 2 of the TourWe accidentally slept through our alarm on our second morning! We were woken up by our hostel staff and has to rush out to our Tuk Tuk at 5 am to make it to Angkor Wat for sunrise. Unfortunately, it ended up being too cloudy, but the haze made the temple look just as magical as it felt.Apparently, the sunrise is only really good twice a year.The rest of our day was packed with adventures and even more temples. We climbed to the 3rd floor of Angkor Wat which, during its reign, was reserved only for the king and queen.After that, we went to Pre Rup (a funeral temple), Banteay Srei (the jewel of Khmer art), Banteay Samré (named after the ancient people of Indochina), East Mebon (used to be on a manmade island), Ta Som (overgrown by a sacred fig tree), Neak Poan (the sacred island), and Preah Khan (contains a stupa that looks like a lit candle from a sunlit opening).Pre RupBanteay Srei TempleIt was a long tuk-tuk ride out to Banteay Srei, but hands down the most incredible drive I’ve ever experienced. We drove past endless green rice fields, children playing, people cooking & working and countless smiles.We even packed some roadies. Cracking a cold one on a tuk-tuk needs to be on everyone’s bucket list.At the Neak Poan temple, we sipped on coconuts and had a couple of local boys help us break them open… or at least help us attempt to open them. We sat down in the ancient temple and sipped away. Definitely a surreal experience!On our way back to Siem Reap, we stopped to make reservations at Koulen Restaurant for dinner and a traditional Apsara dance performance. We made a quick turnaround at the hotel and then left for our dinner performance.The dinner was set up buffet style and literally had every Cambodian dish you could think of… and then some! We stuffed ourselves and watched the beautiful Apsara performance. It was really cool to see!Apsara DancersDo you have any tips for visiting Angkor Wat? Let me know in the comments below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/land-of-smiles-to-the-kingdom-of-wonder/,From the Land of Smiles to the Kingdom of Wonder,Cambodia,"My last morning in Thailand, the “Land of Smiles” was definitely bittersweet. I set out to find the last of my desired swag from the local market and grab my last Thai meal. I walked to Sri Mariamman Temple, a Hindu temple, to pay my last respects to the beautiful country of Thailand that I’ve spent the last two weeks growing to love.Sri Mariamman Temple in BangkokI had been looking for a specific Ganesha pendant my entire trip in Thailand since I first saw it in Krabi and decided not to buy it. Ganesha is the Hindu elephant God widely known as the “Remover of Obstacles.”Throughout my yoga and spiritual practice, I’ve always had a strong connection with this particular figure and wanted to keep something with me along my travels. When I got to the temple I looked at the charms and trinkets they had and, sure enough, there was my Ganesha pendant.After stringing it onto my necklace, I bought my last Thai iced coffee, my last grilled plantain, and my last “folded pancake like taco filled with marshmallow cream and shredded coconut” thing I can’t pronounce in English.I made my way back to the hostel to say my final farewell to Apple, her sister, Katy, and Sevi. After meeting Apple on the flight from Melbourne to Bangkok, meeting Sevi and Katy in Koh Phi Phi, and reuniting again in Koh Phangan, we somehow managed to all meet up in Bangkok one last time. There was never really a need for goodbye until today.We hugged it out, and Lindsay and I were on our way.Our last day in Bangkok togetherI must admit our airport experience was seriously amateur. We arrived 3 hours early and managed to almost miss our flight. After checking in, we got comfortable and grabbed some lunch, organized our things, took a survey for some local kids (while they snuck our photos), wasted time, and didn’t even think about going through customs!Twenty minutes before our boarding time, reality bashed me upside the head as I realized we are most likely going to miss our flight.Getting interviewed by students at the Bangkok AirportWe booked it to the international departures line and waited and waited. We finally made it through security and got through quicker than we anticipated. Thinking we had plenty of time before boarding, we stopped to smell colognes and browse the duty free shops. We then decided to head to our gate at 21C.Wait… There’s no 21C???Gate: Seat: 21C – Easily confused!We checked our tickets again and, sure enough, we had read the seat number. We ran to the departures screen and we realized our plane was literally on the other side of the terminal and it was reading “FINAL CALL.”*Insert cuss word here*We sprinted down the terminal for what seemed like forever, lugging all of our bags, until we got to our gate. There were about four employees waiting and, upon seeing us, smiled in relief and rushed us through.You’ve got to appreciate a culture known for smiling even in times when you’ve pulled a major blonde moment!Brushing up on what to do in CambodiaWhen we boarded the plane, there was this strange steam coming from the overhead bins. We figured it was some sort of fragrant incense. At first we questioned whether or not it was laughing gas but apparently AirAsia goes a step above the rest to ensure a comfortable flight.It was only an hour flight to Phnom Penh, Cambodia but we saw some of the most beautiful cloud formations I’ve ever seen on a flight!Flying above ThailandAfter landing, we had to get our Cambodian visas.Apparently, I was supposed to carry some extra passport size photos with me. Noted. Also, Cambodia uses US dollars! Noted yet again. I started feeling seriously unprepared for Cambodia.Now… What to do with the 14,000 Thai baht I have on me?We decided to catch a night bus to Siem Reap so as not to waste any time and get a full day in at Angkor Wat in the morning. A lovely Spanish couple, Carlos and Sara, approached us outside the airport to organize the adventure together.Monkeys on a wire in Phnom PenhWe all got a cab to the bus station and booked an 8:30 pm bus to Siem Reap. After eating dinner, we boarded our bus for the 6 hour trek up north. I had many friends tell me how rough the roads were here, but that’s a serious understatement!Imagine 3 ft diameter potholes every couple of feet and driving straight through them at 30 mph!Anyways, thanks to my friend Cody’s recommendation, we booked a hostel in Siem Reap and were picked up at 1:30 am when we arrived (complete with welcome sign).Welcome to Cambodia, the “Kingdom of Wonder!”The Temples of Angkor WatTraveling Thailand on $20 per DaySolo Travel in Thailand24 Hours in PhuketThe Beginner’s Guide to Thai Street Food Bangkok Travel TipsHow to Connect with Locals in Southeast AsiaPhi Phi Ley Island HoppingThe Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok "
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-morocco-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Morocco on a Budget,Morocco,"One of the most captivating countries in North Africa, Morocco has it all. From the madness of Marrakech’s maze-like streets and hectic markets to the vast empty Sahara Desert and its nomadic peoples, you can have a different experience each and every time.With a diverse population and strong European influences, Morocco has a rich past and present. The dynamic culture has created world-famous cuisine and some of the planet’s most beautiful handcrafts (shout out to my fellow Moroccan boho-style lovers!).Looking to travel Morocco but don’t want to break the bank? Here are all my tips for traveling on a budget!  When to GoMorocco is an incredibly diverse country. Exploring the snowy Atlas Mountains, the bustling medinas of Marrakech, the arid Sahara Desert, and Mediterranean woodlands, each region is vastly different.This diversity is one of the things that brings me back time and time again.When it comes to cheap Moroccan travel, you’ll generally want to avoid the peak months of July and August. Visiting in winter will let you get a more authentic glimpse of life in Morocco without all the tourists. From Europe, you can fly to hotspots like Marrakech and Fes for as cheap as $20 so things can get seriously busy.For a full season by season breakdown, check out my guide to the best time to visit Morocco to give you an idea of what to expect.Where to StayYou can find options at every price point in Morocco. If you’re in a major city like Marrakech or Fes, plan for around 80-110 MAD ($8-12 USD) per night to stay in a basic hostel. If you opt to stay further from the center of the city, you can find spots as cheap as 50 MAD ($5 USD).If you are up for paying 1500-250 MAD ($16-26 USD) per night, you can upgrade to a private room in the city. If you’re outside of town, you’ll be looking at even lower costs.  Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');TransportationPublic transportation can be hit or miss in Morocco. In Marrakech and Casablanca, you’ll find public bus services but, honestly, it’s not really worth it. The buses are old, crowded, and really hard to figure out. If you are limited on time, you’re better off to go with a faster method since transport, in general, is affordable.Want to travel around Morocco but don’t want to worry about transportation? Check out the TBA Escapes Morocco Adventure Tour!TaxisTaxis are typically a good option but negotiate before you get in. The prices aren’t fixed or metered and cabbies expect you to drive a hard bargain. Know exactly what you are going to pay before taking off.When it comes to taxis, there are a few options. Petits taxis are super popular. These tiny little vehicles that can hold up to three people.They are cheap, though you will still want to negotiate ahead of time and be aware that there is often a surcharge after 8 pm. Having a surprise charge at the end of the trip will just be frustrating and cause confusion.To go on longer trips, grand taxis can be a good choice. They carry up to six passengers and only leave when they are totally full. You’ll easily find them at most taxi stands and bus stations.Again, confirm the cost before you get inside and keep in mind that there may be a luggage surcharge if you’re carrying a lot of baggage.   Train TravelI took an overnight train in Morocco and loved it!There are a few sleeper car options. You can get a spot in a four-bed compartment room for Dh370 ($38 USD), a private double compartment is Dh690 ($70 USD), or a private single for Dh480 ($50 USD).For a long-distance trip, especially one that will cover a night’s accommodation, it’s a bargain.  Sahara DesertBook a TourWhile Morocco is a good destination for solo travelers and women, the distances between the best parts of the country make the option of booking a tour worth considering.You can save time and money by booking a package that includes transportation and accommodation. There are options galore so it’s easy to find one that covers what you’re looking to do and see.   Cheap EatsIn most Moroccan towns, you are never far from a market and it’s the perfect place to try the local cuisine. A staple meal is tagine—a slow-cooked dish of spiced meat and veg (with occasional vegetarian options), along with a traditional Moroccan mint tea.And the street food! You can eat well on the cheap here.For just a couple of dollars, you have your pick of barbecued corn on the cob, kebabs, sausages, roasted chicken, and massive sandwiches. You’ll also find a range of cheap sit-down eateries with dishes around 30 MAD ($3 USD). For the most part, you actually have to go out of your way to pay a lot to eat here.Read More:Traditional Foods to Try in MoroccoBuying + Bargaining for SouvenirsFrom luxe handmade rugs to one of a kind pottery, Morocco is a shopper’s paradise.Just come prepared to do your homework. You’ll often find the same item from numerous vendors so shop around to get an idea of the price. Get a number in mind that you’re happy to pay then bargain a bit.Remember, it’s all about getting a price both you and the seller think it fair rather than trying to get a steal on every deal.

Featured all over Instagram, the artsy blue-washed village feels as if you’ve been transported into a new world the minute you arrive.Nicknamed “The Blue Pearl,” the village was founded in 1471 by Jews and Moors who were fleeing from Spain. There are many different theories as to why it’s blue. Some say it was painted by the Jews who settled there after escaping Europe in the 1930s, while others say it keeps the mosquitos away.It’s also said to be blue because it represents the color of the sea and the sky.Whatever the reason for its magnificent blue hue, one this is certain: Chefchaouen is absolutely stunning and is a major highlight in Morocco—find some of my other highlights in this two-week itinerary for Morocco!Because Morocco can get pretty hot, wandering around town during the day can get pretty uncomfortable. This makes choosing the best time to visit important as walking is the easiest way to get around town. My favorite time to visit is between March and April when you’ll find deals on hotels and flights and you won’t have to bump shoulders with crowds of people.Read More: Tips for Traveling Morocco on a BudgetIf you do decide to visit during the warmer months, keep in mind that Morocco is a conservative country. This means you’ll want to err on the side of caution when trying to decide what to pack and how to dress.

Since 2012, when I started The Blonde Abroad, I’ve received so many inquiries about itineraries and requests to plan trips just like mine…so I thought, why not do just that?My goal with creating TBA Escapes was to curate educational tours for the adventurous female traveler—the woman who dreams of colorful destinations far from her comfort zone. The flagship TBA Escapes tour is in South Africa, we have an Ancient Wonders Tour in Jordan, Luxury Yacht Eco Expedition exploring the Galápagos Islands…and other destinations will be announced soon!Today, I’m so excited to share the highlights and testimonials from the TBA Escapes Morocco Adventure Tour! We discovered the “Blue City” of Chefchaouen, cooked traditional Moroccan food in Casablanca, experienced local life in Fes and made our way through the souks of Marrakech. We even adventured into the Sahara Desert for the ultimate luxury glamping experience.With the help of several local guides along with TBA Escape’s Head Host and “Escape Artist,” Caity, we traveled from the far north to the south on one seriously epic adventure while enjoying luxurious riads and hotels along the way.Ready to see the highlights from the TBA Escapes Morocco Adventure Tour? Let’s look!  Chefchaouen  All The Blue Hues!          The Blue City of ChefchaouenThe ‘Blue City’ is arguably one of the prettiest places in Morocco. Set against a wide valley and nestled between two peaks in the stunning Rif Mountains, its medina has been lovingly cared for with striking blue and whitewashed houses.Caity guided the girls to the best photo opp spots and it was so awesome to see them all helping each other get the *best* IG-worthy shot.The girls were treated with a Hammam experience at a local spa. A hammam is a Middle Eastern type of steam room bath experience intended as a frequent ritual for cleansing the body. Let’s just say this was a real ice breaker activity! 😉  Fes         Sampling Local Dishes     Leather Goods in Fes    FesOnce we checked into our beautiful riad, we adventured through narrow streets alive with craftsmen, markets, tanneries, mosques, and colorful local characters.What’s cooler than being able to watch how traditional Moroccan pottery is made?! The only thing that made it even better was the leather goodies that we walked away with!While in Fes we went on a souk tasting trail and sampled our way through Morrocan pastries, nougat, olives and dried fruits. Hellloooo, Moroccan food! Oh and you can bet that *alllll* the Moroccan mint tea was had. 😉  Casablanca    CasablancaAlthough Casablanca was quick, there was still enough time to take a Moroccan food making class to learn how to prepare the famous dish: tajine.Because the itinerary was so jam-packed, Casablanca was the perfect place to catch up on a little R&R. We stayed at a hotel with gym facilities and Western food options, which was especially nice for those who may have felt a little “tagine’ed” out and needed to move their body a little after all the driving!  Le Riad Yasmine, Marrakech  Moroccan Honey          YSL Museum   Hanging at the Hammam MarrakechMarrakech was the ultimate slumber party! We privately booked Le Riad Yasmine where we took a dip in the prettiest pool before exploring the bustling souks of Marrakech.Along with watching the sunset from rooftops, visiting historical mosques, wandering Le Jardin Secret, putting our bargaining skills to test, and exploring treasure troves full of *magic* lamps, the city was absolutely mesmerizing.  Sahara Desert       Sahara DesertThe trip to the Sahara Desert was a 4-night adventure straight out of a movie. We were picked up in private 4×4 vehicles and escorted to the Atlas Mountains. During our stay, we discovered the ancient ruins of Ait Ben Haddou, experienced the grandeur of the Todra Gorge, and stargazed from the middle of the Sahara Dunes. TBA Escapes Morocco Adventure Tour TestimonialsMaggie B. “The TBA Escapes Ultimate Morocco Adventure truly exceeded my expectations! From the pre-trip communication to the last day of the excursion, everything was seamless and fun. Caity Shearer was so organized, calm and patient, and is who made this trip memorable for me. I had the pleasure of spending time with 12 other amazing women from all different cities and backgrounds. We bonded immediately over our love of traveling and had the best 14 days together exploring Morocco. Thank you TBA Escapes for the trip of a lifetime!!”Tara L. “I have never given someone else the voice of my vacation. I like to do things my way in my time, so giving that to someone else was overwhelming. But then there was a sweet young lady named Caity waiting for my arrival at the airport. The moment I met her, everything was arranged for me. Everything from dietary restrictions to sightseeing, my voice was heard. I would have never gone to Morocco myself, so this was the perfect chance to see a place with an incredible group of people. #saharaburn”Caitlin F. “I’ve been on two TBA Escapes tours and both have been exceptional. The Morocco trip was a dream come true. I’ve been dying to visit Morocco for years, but it always felt so intimidating…I didn’t know where to start. When TBAescapes announced the Morocco tour, I knew I couldn’t miss it. I’m so glad I didn’t. It was one of the best trips I have ever had. Every part on the tour was so intentional and mindful. The food was delicious, the accommodations were divine, and every stop felt special and magical. Caity, our guide, was incredible at leading us, but also making a connection with every single woman on the tour. Her light and positivity were contagious, and she made sure every one of us were taken care of. I cannot recommend this tour enough. Seeing the Sahara was beyond anything I could ever imagine, and seeing it with such an incredible group of women on such a well-planned adventure was the icing on the cake!”Victoria T. “My tour with TBAEscapes was absolutely out of this world! The accommodations were stunning and the food was delicious; we were literally treated like royalty! Going into the tour I was a little nervous of the safety of the location, but our guides made sure that our safety was of the utmost importance, and I never felt uncomfortable at all during our trip. Traveling with a group of like-minded women was one of the highlights for me! Everyone was so incredibly nice, supportive, and adventurous. Morocco was truly a DREAM, and it was all made possible by TBA Escapes!”Abby R. “TBA Escapes planned the perfect trip to Morocco! All transfers, accommodations, meals, and activities were expertly planned and executed and allowed us the opportunity to see so much of Morocco in two weeks. From the beautiful blue walls of Chefchaouen to the winding alleys and souks of Marrakesh, we experienced it all! The excursion to the Sahara was a once in a lifetime experience I will never forget. I could not recommend this, or any other TBA Escapes tour, more! I met such amazing women who share my passion for travel. Do not hesitate to join a TBA Escapes trip if you have the opportunity.

The streets of Marrakech are chaotic, the contrasts will mesmerize you, and the scents and sounds of the city can overwhelm you.If you’re looking to experience the more relaxed side of Morocco, add two days in Essaouira to your itinerary. Located on the country’s Atlantic coast, it’s known for its laid back atmosphere, excellent kitesurfing conditions, and beautiful beaches.Ready to explore Morocco? Here’s how to spend 48 hours in Essaouira! Getting ThereThe best way to get to Essaouira is to fly in from Marrakech. However, if you’re on a budget, there is a bus that connects the two cities.The journey takes about 2.5 hours, and multiple companies make the trip throughout the day. Another option is to hire a taxi from Marrakech Airport and a one-way trip will cost around $90.During my two-week trip around Morocco, we drove from the Skoura Valley Oasis (after a stay in the Sahara desert) to Essaouira.

With a rooftop pool, restaurant and luxurious rooms, it’s a great option for a luxurious stay.Read More: What to Wear in Morocco as a Female Traveler Day OneExplore the MedinaStart your first day in Essaouira exploring the Medina. Originally named Mogador, it was once an international trading seaport, linking Morocco with Europe and the rest of the world.Unlike Marrakech, Essaouira’s medina is smaller and calmer. You’ll find spices, juices, crepes, handbags, and more!Walk the Port SideNext, take a 10-minute walk to Essaouira’s port side. In its heyday, it linked the country to Africa, Europe, and the Americas.Today, fishing boats still line up along the port and stalls are selling fresh fruit and fish. It’s a great spot to pick up some snacks or food if you’re staying in self-catering accommodation.Grab Lunch at La Chalet De La PlageSince 1893, Le Chalet De La Plage has been a staple on Essaouira’s restaurant scene. Located on the seafront, it overlooks the ocean making it an excellent spot for lunch or sundowners.Don’t leave without eating your weight in their fresh seafood dishes!Try a Traditional HammamA hammam is a Middle Eastern version of a steam bath. Similar to a sauna, Villa Maroc boasts one of the city’s top Hamman sessions that you can pair with nine kinds of massages.After a long day of shopping, eating and exploring, it’s a perfect way to unwind before dinner.Have Dinner at La LicorneEnd your first day in Essaouira with a romantic meal at La Licorne. The restaurant has a wonderful ambiance and the menu is full of delicious and authentic Moroccan food.I recommend trying the seafood dishes like spider crab or the vegetable pastilla! Day TwoWalk on the BeachWake up early and spend the morning exploring Essaouira’s beaches before the heat of the day kicks in. If you’re feeling adventurous, you can try your hand at windsurfing or kitesurfing.I recommend Plage Tagharte, but if you have the time Plage Safi, Cap Sim, and Sidi Kaouki are also good options.Visit the Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdullah MuseumThe history museum is named after the founder of Essaouira, Mohammed Ben Abdullah. Located in a 19th-century mansion and it houses historical artifacts such as pottery, coins, jewelry, photographs, and carpets which are all relevant to Essaouira’s history.One of my personal favorites is the costume display!Sign Up for a Cooking ClassInstead of going out to lunch on your last day in Essouria, attend a cooking class! It’s one of my favorite ways to soak up another country’s culture and add a delicious dish to my repertoire.Unwind at a Rooftop PoolThere’s nothing better than an epic rooftop pool overlooking the city. Not only are the photo ops amazing, but with Morocco’s heat, there’s no better way to cool off before dinner.L’heure Bleue Palais boasts panoramic views of Essaouira. It’s one of the best spots in the city to grab a cocktail and watch the sunset in style.Have Dinner at L’heure Bleue PalaisAfter soaking up the last few rays of sunlight at the rooftop pool, make your way downstairs to L’heure Bleue Palais onsite restaurant. The elegant Salon Oriental serves up inventive Moroccan cuisine, and the restaurant is decked out in opulence.Come here on weekends for their themed nights and a more festive atmosphere. OverallVisiting Essaouira is a unique experience, and I’m so glad I included it on my two week Morocco itinerary. While Marrakech is the more well-known tourist spot, Essaouira is less chaotic and offers the same authentic cuisine, markets and shopping, beautiful views and a rich in history.Read More: Essential Tips for Your First Trip to Morocco Have you been to Essaouira?

While some countries are much more strict with their cultural and social expectations, I always err on the side of caution and dress conservatively to avoid any unwanted attention or to cause offense.For the most part, countries that have a large Muslim, Hindu and/or Buddhist influence are the countries that you’ll need to cover up in. It’s important to respect local and religious traditions at all times, and you should be aware of your behavior to ensure it doesn’t offend local customs — and that begins with dressing modestly.Take time to think through your outfits and pack for your trip to a conservative country!It is considered a sign of respect to keep your knees and shoulders covered, and so I’d recommend making sure you have items in your suitcase to do just that. When visiting very conservative destination, you may need to go as far as to cover your arms (down to the hands), hair, and feet.Headscarves may not be required everywhere in a conservative country, but from my experience in Morocco, I found that whenever I received unwanted attention as a tourist, all I had to do was cover my head and nobody would bother me. My rule of thumb is to always have something I could drape around my shoulders and cover my legs with, in case it’s necessary while I’m out exploring.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for when you plan your own trip to a conservative country like Morocco, Jordan, Turkey, Dubai, Indonesia, and more!What to Pack for Trip to a Conservative Country !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-its-like-traveling-as-a-woman-in-morocco/,Is Morocco Safe for Female Travelers?,Morocco,"Updated: August 2019Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Morocco. From the charming quaint villages of the Atlas Mountains to the vibrant city markets, this is one North African country that should be on your travel bucket list.With that said, people often ask me if Morocco is a safe destination for women. The simple answer is: yes. I traveled all over the country and I never felt in danger. However, there’s a lot more to safety and traveling as a solo female, and a lot of it has to do with cultural differences.Moroccan culture may take some adjusting to if you haven’t experienced anything like it.Here are my thoughts on traveling Morocco safely as a woman.Is Morocco Safe for Female Travelers?In short, YES! Morocco is a safe country to visit for female travelers. As with all destinations, my best advice is to remain vigilant. The main crimes you need to watch out for are pickpockets and scams.As a female traveler, you’ll need to have your guard up a bit more as the unwanted attention from men in Morocco can get exhausting.Another question that I get asked quite a lot is if Morocco is safe for Americans. I never experienced any discrimination in the country because of my nationality or felt threatened.While you’re unlikely to be in real physical danger, petty crime and harassment can happen. Use common sense, your best judgment, and follow my safety tips for Morocco below and you’ll be able to avoid any real problems. Set Boundaries in MoroccoAs soon as you hit the streets, you’ll likely attract the attention of a few men. Whether they are shop-owners trying to get a sale or locals trying to get a reaction out of you, the unwanted attention gets stale very quickly.I would say that from personal experience, and feedback from friends, the most painful part of a trip to Morocco is unwanted attention from men. It’s not that I felt unsafe, just extremely uncomfortable with so much attention and name-calling. I won’t sugar coat it. I heard expletives of all kinds shouted at me, from “you’re a [email protected]!” to “suck my d!ck, Miley Cyrus!”.Unfortunately, even for local Moroccan women, sexual harassment is an ongoing issue.I found it easiest to deal with when I covered my head in crowded areas. I would walk close to other tourists — specifically men. That might sound crazy, but when my friend Jessica and I walked closely behind male tourists, the cat-calling stopped completely.The best advice I can offer you is to simply ignore it. Don’t feel obligated to respond to everyone who talks to you and get comfortable with having their words go in one ear and out the other.The male harassment can start to feel overwhelming, but it’s worse if you let yourself get worked up. I was frequently tempted to scream back at the men equally expletive things. But, know that it is not worth it. Morocco is a different country, with different laws, and, unfortunately, the law might not always be just or in our favor.Again, it’s not that I felt unsafe in Morocco, but the leering could be uncomfortable at times. So long as you don’t stop and engage with every man that looks your way on the street, you’ll find that it gets easier to ignore.Dress Appropriately in MoroccoFinding the right clothes to wear in Morocco is very much a large consideration. Ultimately, the less you wear, the more attention you are going to get.This is an issue made tricky by the fact that it can get incredibly hot in the country. Temperatures exceed 100 degrees in the Sahara Desert in the summer so staying cool is an actual necessity.Your best options are lightweight full-coverage looks. Think scarves and maxi skirts! Before you go, be sure to check out my post on what to wear in Morocco as a female traveler for inspiration on comfortable outfits for conservative destinations.Read More:What to Wear in Morocco as a Female TravelerSolo Travel in Morocco as a WomanOf course, you all know that I find solo travel to be an incredibly empowering experience. There are so many amazing destinations perfect for visiting on your own.So is it safe to travel to Morocco alone? I think so, but at the same time, I feel that Morocco is a destination best enjoyed with friends. I would never say you need a man along to have a good time, but you will get less unwanted attention when you’re with others (especially those of the male variety).I’ve even heard of female travelers who wear faux wedding rings to keep men at bay.Though, from my experience, the local men started calling at me before I was close enough for them to see my fingers.You can have a great time in Morocco with your girls, too. I traveled with my friend Jessica. It was definitely annoying for us walking around together at times but, the few times we went into the city alone, we were far more overwhelmed. Traveling in a group will definitely make you feel less singled out by cat-callers.If you do want to experience Morocco alone, consider joining an organized tour group. There are incredible options all over Morocco that are worth checking out. Otherwise, grow a thick skin and always use common sense!If you do want to experience Morocco alone, consider joining an organized tour group. I’m even hosting my own TBA Escapes All-Female Tour in Morocco! If you’d still prefer to travel to Morocco alone, grow some thick skin and always use common sense to stay safe!Read More:Why Solo Female Travel Isn’t “Safe”The Solo Female Traveler's Guide to Marrakech  Research Morocco’s CultureWhether you’re traveling to China, Brazil or Morocco, for example, it’s always good form to learn about the culture before you go. It’s easy to make a faux-pas when you don’t know the local customs.Morocco is a predominantly Islamic country, which means that women dress very conservatively (though, in tourist hotspots like Marrakech, you’ll see all kinds of fashion). Most local women don’t smoke or drink in public and, in many Moroccan cities, it’s a common belief that only prostitutes do these things. You often won’t see women out by themselves, and storefronts are usually hangouts for men only.It is also worth noting that only Muslims are allowed into some mosques. However, there are a few open to tourists. Keep in mind you’ll need to be covered past your knees and over your shoulders to enter.  Fes, MoroccoWatch Out for Scams in MoroccoOne of the big things you need to watch out for in Morocco is the scams. Whether you’re visiting Marrakech or Fes, you’ll find people trying to entice you into their shops.It usually starts with a local inviting you in for tea or someone wanting you to read or write a letter to their cousin. Don’t fall for it!It’s a scam to get you into the store so they can wear you down and eventually get you to buy something. The vendors are relentless, so save yourself the headache and firmly say “no thank you,” or say nothing, and walk away. Don’t worry about hurting people’s feelings. Tips for Staying Safe in MoroccoAvoid Wandering in Alleys Alone: The key to staying safe in Morocco often means not venturing too far away from the crowds. The quiet back alleys are often where thieves hang out.Remember, you don’t know the streets as well as the locals. You could easily walk down an alley that leads to a dead-end and put yourself in a risky situation.That being said, the most populated touristy areas are also where most thieves hang out. They’re looking for an easy opportunity, so keep your belongings in sight and be aware of your surroundings.Leave Your Valuables at the Riad or Hotel: Morocco is not the place to show off your wealth. It will only attract more attention. So, leave your flashy designer bags and jewelry at home. Don’t forget to leave your passport in your hotel room safe as well (this goes for nearly every travel destination!).Don’t Look Lost: No matter where you are in the world, you don’t want to look lost while exploring a city. Scammers will spot you from a mile away! If you need to look at your phone for directions, make sure the maps are preloaded and try to look at your device as inconspicuously as possible.Try to memorize it as much as possible, so you don’t need to be constantly glancing down.You want to always walk with purpose and keep your eyes forward. It will help you avoid sticking out and looking like a damsel in distress.Don’t Walk Around Morocco Alone at Night: If you must, make sure you’re in a group and listen to your gut! If something doesn’t feel right, rather pay for a taxi and get to your hotel or destination safely. Get Travel Insurance for MoroccoTrust me. You don’t want to go to Morocco without travel insurance. If your bag is stolen with your new DSLR camera, you’ll want to have the peace of mind that it’s covered.I’ve been using World Nomads travel insurance for years, and I’ve never had a problem when I’ve needed to submit a claim.Read More:Do I Need Travel Insurance?10 Reasons to Get Travel Insurance for Your Next Trip I wanted to share my personal experience (the good, the bad, and the ugly) so that you can have realistic expectations before visiting. Travel is not always butterflies and rainbows. Aside from the unwanted attention, I truly had an amazing trip. Morocco is a beautiful country and most people I met were absolutely wonderful."

Tables are scattered throughout the property, so you can dig in to fresh dishes in the dining room, on the patio, or at the pool.One thing I especially loved is that you can grab a basket of treats for picnics in the garden.There’s also the TOUCO café near the pool, which is a must-try local street food experience run by the residents of the nearby Tassoultante Village.Activities at Fellah HotelThe Fellah is more than a hotel; it has done so much to turn the place into an experience, and it has definitely succeeded.The hotel offers yoga classes, a library, and a spa for when you want to chill.When you’re ready to dive into local life, head out to the farm to gather eggs, groom the donkeys, or milk the goats. Once you are ready to be off your feet, check out the artists in residence program, and then make your way over to the Salon for concerts, DJs, film screenings, and regular banquets.If you’re bringing little ones, the Fellah Hotel has activities for kids that you will want to check out.

It offers an incredibly diverse calendar of activities so you can have a blast without even leaving the hotel.Even if you have time for only one thing, I highly recommend getting to the kitchen for the expert cooking classes. I’m obsessed with Moroccan food—and I’m sure you will be too after checking out this class; it’s the ultimate souvenir.Another great way to learn something new and soak in the culture is with one of the Arabic language sessions at the lodge.Treat yourself to a henna session.

And, whatever you do, look into the day trips. On Mondays, you can visit a local souk (traditional market) and browse for a while; then plan a full day or more to explore the region.L’Ma is in the heart of a stunning area and it offers excursions to Rose Valley, the almond trees, Dades, and Draa Valley, which means you can really see the best of Morocco from here.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>More InformationHotel: L’Ma LodgeLocation: Skoura Valley, MoroccoAccommodation: Boutique, LuxuryPrice Range: $$ "

https://theblondeabroad.com/morocco-outfit-inspiration/,Morocco Outfit Inspiration,Morocco," Before my recent trip to Morocco, I had some serious issues deciding what to pack. I was traveling to Morocco in March, so I knew the weather would be warm, and it was very humid, which made packing conservative clothing even trickier!Because Morocco is a conservative and religious country, clothing is something you should be mindful of to respect the local culture and social norms. Local women dress very conservatively, but you’ll see a range of styles on the streets, especially in Marrakech.Here’s some Morocco outfit inspiration based on my own conservative travel styles!Long Kaftan + Tan SandalsThe most comfortable outfit you can rock in Morocco is a long kaftan. The style has been worn by men and women for thousands of years. Lucky for us, they’re in fashion so there are tons of super cute options available online! !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

While some countries are much more strict with their cultural expectations, I always err on the side of caution and dress conservatively to avoid any unwanted attention or to cause offense.It’s important to respect local and religious traditions at all times, and you should be aware of your behavior to ensure it doesn’t offend local customs — this begins with dressing modestly!Throughout Morocco, it is considered a sign of respect to keep your knees and shoulders covered.

https://theblondeabroad.com/spending-24-hours-in-fes-morocco/,"Spending 24 Hours in Fes, Morocco",Morocco,"Known as the cultural capital of Morocco, Fes is one place you’ll definitely want to see. Stroll around the winding streets to explore the famous Fes El Bali walled medina and shop the colorful souks while soaking in the old world charm.Fes is located just over 300 miles from Marrakech so you can get there via train or plane. And it’s well worth the trip! This UNESCO World Heritage site city is one the most well-preserved old Arab cities in the world and it’s the planet’s largest car-free urban area.Ready to start exploring? Here’s my experience spending 24 hours in Fes, Morocco.Stay at Dar Seffarine in Fes, MoroccoOn my trip in Morocco, I only had one night in Fes. I stayed at Dar Seffarine and it’s definitely a spot I’d recommend. Located in the the ancient medina, it is a central location and has a traditional Moroccan style that is absolutely stunning.It’s the oldest hotel in the medina and, with just six guest rooms, it has a very intimate feel– a nice place to escape the busy streets.Start your day early at Dar Seffarine! They serve a tasty breakfast on the roof. It’s a good spot to linger, take in the sun, and get inspired for a day of exploration.Visit the Tanneries in FesLeather tanneries are a big thing in Morocco and you can’t visit the country without checking out at least one. The tours are fascinating and education but smelly. Seriously smelly! A lot of places offer you herbs to hold under your nose while you’re walking around, but the smell is still incredibly powerful. It is totally worth it in my opinion though. It is just something you’ll want to be prepared for (maybe don’t plan a visit around mealtime).Handcrafted leather is a great Moroccan souvenir and, even if you’re not a leather fan, there are a lot of beautiful pieces of handiwork to browse at tanneries and in the souks.Shop 64While the tanneries are worth exploring, they are actually more interesting from above. There’s a famous shot featuring a perfect vista of the tanneries.It took us a while to track down the right angle for the “perfect shot” but it’s actually from the balcony of a place called Shop 64. In a land of winding alleyways and narrow streets, it’s best to ask a local how to get to Shop 64.We were lucky enough to ask a local guy on the street who knew just where to go, and he promptly lead us up a few flights of stairs to the perfect view of the tannery. Upon entering, you’ll be handed mint– don’t be shy to ask for more if needed!It’s free to visit, but typically a little tip or small souvenir purchase is a nice “thank you.”Explore Al Attarine MadrasaStanding in the heart of the medina, that’s been around since 1325, this madrasa (which is the Arabic word for any sort of educational institution) is a must-see for any visitor of Fes. It is one of the few madrasas open to the public and the architecture is stunning.It doesn’t take too long to visit, but with such an interesting history- and amazing photo opps- you won’t want to miss Al Attarine Madrasa.I was blown away by the details in the tile, the architecture and just the serene nature of the courtyard. We were lucky enough to have a few moments alone to take in the sight.The Markets in MedinaI absolutely love shopping in the medinas of Morocco. Filled with endless lines of color and aromas, these heady markets are unlike anything else that you’ll find in the world. You can bargain with any vendor and get rock bottom prices on great stuff.The aesthetic of Morocco is one of my faves. I adore the rich textiles like Berber rugs and wedding blankets, and the fab lanterns. It is also an amazing spot to stock the kitchen, with fresh and local spices like saffron, turmeric, and cumin, alongside cool kitchenware like tagines and super chic tea glasses.Don’t miss the markets in Medina!Our day in Fes was jam-packed and I felt like we saw a lot of the highlights we set out to see. As with everything in Morocco, it was more spectacular than we expected!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/moroccos-sahara-desert-glamping-guide/,Morocco’s Sahara Desert Glamping Guide,Morocco,"Did you know that the Sahara Desert is almost as big as the entire United States? This vast landscape is filled with natural treasures, and it has sparked my interest for some time.During my latest Moroccan adventure, I wanted to check the magnificent desert off my bucket list, so my friend Jessica and I decided to travel from Marrakech and spend a few nights glamping at a luxury Sahara desert camp– it was an unforgettable experience. BUT, it is a long journey to get there.We decided to book with a private camp, Desert Luxury Camp, for a three-night luxury glamping adventure. The experience included two nights in their luxury tents and one night at the Skoura Oasis.If you’re headed to northern Africa, I highly recommend getting out of the cities for at least one night to see the incredible, natural landscapes.Here’s my guide to exploring and glamping in Morocco’s Sahara Desert!Getting to The Sahara DesertI learned that there were many “desert” day tours and getaways offered out of the major cities like Marrakech, but many don’t actually go all the way to the Sahara due to the travel time.But I was committed to getting there!We started our journey around 7:30 am from Marrakech, with the private driver we booked through the Desert Camp. Our driver met us with a 4WD car and we began our journey driving through the Atlas Mountains. Six hours of mountains, valleys, winding roads, and breathtaking views.We stopped around 1 pm, to stretch our legs and grab a bite to eat. Our driver brought us to a yummy little spot, and then we continued on for about 3 more hours until arriving at the desert! After passing through the “gates of the Sahara”, it was still about an hour drive out of town and a 4WD journey through sand.Eventually, we made it to the camp around sunset. It wasn’t the most comfortable travel day, but we were so amazed when we finally arrived.I can’t even describe it!Helpful Tip: Make sure to bring toilet paper, medication if you get carsick, plenty of snacks and water.What to Expect at a Sahara Desert CampThere are many Sahara Desert tours offered, with options ranging from camping, day trips, or extra night add-ons coupled with city tours. There are honestly a ton of options to choose from, and so we just chose to go off a few recommendations and booked with Desert Luxury Camp.The camp situated in the Sahara Desert was a dream– it was definitely the ultimate nomad experience but “glamped” up. Our team was ultra friendly and helpful, which is key to having a good experience anywhere. The food was incredible (I’m waiting on the Berber restaurant trend!), and I never felt like I was roughing it.The beds were comfortable, and the tents have full bathrooms (warm showers), outlets, and blankets, so you won’t feel like you’re camping in the Sahara– but “glamping” instead!Throughout our four day Sahara Desert adventure, we hiked dunes to watch the sunrise, rode camels and sand-boarded. We visited Ksar of Ait Benhouddou, Skoura Oasis, and traveled to Todra Gorge to check out the water and grab a bite to eat.The evenings spent watching the sunset from camp are moments I will never forget.4 Day Itinerary for the Sahara DesertDAY 1The first day was a travel day for us. As described above, we left Marrakech at 7:30 am and travel by private car for about 11 hours until reaching the Luxury Desert Camp. Just in time for a beautiful sunset and a delicious dinner!DAY 2We woke up before sunrise to join our guide on a hike. We climbed the highest dune in the area and watched the sun break over the expansive desert. It was a magical moment!We spent about an hour taking in the view, shooting photos and chatting with our guide before heading back to camp. After a picturesque breakfast, we had opted for a camel ride before the sun got too high in the sky.After about an hour-long ride, Jessica and I spent the rest of the day hanging out at the camp. It was really nice to be disconnected from cell phone service, and just sit around and relax. Before the sun set, we tried our hand at sand-boarding. Let’s just assume I wasn’t the most graceful 😉Evening at the camp was memorable—live Berber music, a great dinner spread, and the most stars I’ve ever seen! We fell asleep in the luxury tents for our second night.DAY 3Day three was our last day at the camp, so after our early breakfast, we departed around 8 am with our private driver. Instead of heading back to Marrakech, we drove towards the Skoura Oasis.We grabbed some lunch and then headed on to the Todra Gorge to see running water. Afterward, we made were dropped off at our hotel in the Skoura Oasis, filled with hundreds of palm trees.Skoura is a beautiful oasis located in Dades Valley, a.k.a the Valley of One Thousand Kasbahs.There are many hotels to choose from in Skoura, and you can find something that fits in with your budget. We opted for a beautiful stay at L’Ma Lodge and would say we both absolutely loved it.DAY 4Sadly, this was our final morning in the desert! Our next stop was Essaouira, so our driver met us at L’Ma Lodge at 8 am and we started our journey. On the way, we stopped at the incredible Ksar of Ait-Ben-Haddou for a quick tour with a local guide that was informative.Along with a few stops for food and the restrooms, we arrived in Essaouira around 5:30 pm.Helpful Tips for Traveling to the Sahara DesertBring toilet paper, medication, snacks, and water. While it’s a luxe experience, you’ll still be in the middle of the desert, so you can’t just run down to the corner store for something. And throughout Morocco, toilet paper isn’t the norm. Most bathrooms have bidet-style options that use water instead of paper.Wear appropriate clothing. You’ll be hiking and riding camels, so be prepared!Be prepared for cold nights. Temperatures in Skoura can vary by one hundred degrees throughout the year, so it’s good to check the weather before you go. In the summer, temperatures in a single day can range from seventy to 110 degrees. In the winter, temps can be between forty and seventy degrees. Whatever the weather is like when you go, you’ll feel a major drop at night.Pack well: sunscreen and a hat are essential in the desert. You’ll also want comfortable closed-toe shoes for exploring the areas as well as flip-flops for when you’re running around the campgrounds. Also, wipes are great for long days of travel.Bring cash. It’s handy to have cash for tips. Generally speaking, you’ll want to keep at least a Moroccan dirham in your pocket any time you’re out. Cash is king here. More InformationHotel: Desert Luxury CampLocation: Sahara Desert, MoroccoAccommodation: Boutique, Glamping, LuxuryPrice Range: $$-$$$WATCH my Morocco Video!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-wear-in-morocco-as-a-female-traveler/,What to Wear in Morocco as a Female Traveler,Morocco,"Packing for conservative countries, like Morocco, can be tricky—especially when the weather is warm. While it’s good to stay covered, it’s also essential to stay cool. Local women dress conservatively, but you’ll see a wide range of styles on the streets of this ultra-popular tourist destination.Women in tourist areas wear everything from bikini tops to burkas. I highly recommend finding some middle ground, respecting local culture, and dressing conservatively in Morocco. Street harassment is common, and, like it or not, the amount of attention and respect that you get will depend on what you wear. Want to look and feel amazing on your adventure?Here’s what to wear in Morocco as a female traveler!And don’t miss my Morocco Packing Guide either!Clothing Tips for MoroccoDress for the WeatherIn the winter, you’ll find temperature from forty to seventy, and in the hottest months of summer, days range from seventy to over one hundred degrees Fahrenheit. At any time of the year, bring warm layers for the evening.Bring Practical ShoesClosed-toe and comfortable shoes are must-haves for long days of exploring. It’s also handy to have flip-flops for when you want to run around the riad or campgrounds.Think Loose and FlowyAll things lightweight and full coverage is ideal — loose trousers or maxi skirts are perfect. A tunic shirt with leggings or a full kaftan is perfect too. Not only does full coverage allow you to dress conservatively in Morocco, but it will also protect you from the sun.Wear a ScarfWhatever you wear, have a lightweight scarf with you. You can use is to cover up before going into a mosque or just keep the sun off your skin when you’re overheating. Moroccan scarves are also gorgeous souvenirs. You’ll find them in pretty much any city or town, so you don’t need to bring your own if you don’t want to.Use Sun ProtectionThe sun in Morocco can be intense throughout the year. Bring sunglasses, a hat, and sunscreen. "

This year I got to visit this magical place with my good friend, Jessica, of Bon Traveler!This country is so vibrant and full of color, everywhere we went I was amazed by the unique culture.Our two-week trip started off in the major city of Marrakech. Here we explored the busy streets, shops, and ate to our heart’s content. We stayed for two nights at the Pinterest-worthy Riad Yasmine, and from there went to La Mamounia Hotel for two more nights. There are so many markets in Marrakech filled with Moroccan goods– spices, rugs and beautiful clothes galore!We woke up bright and early the next day to take a trip out to the Sahara desert with Luxury Desert Camp.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-traveling-by-train-in-morocco/,The Ultimate Guide to Traveling by Train in Morocco,Morocco,"Getting around Morocco by train is a great option for all types of travelers. They’re fast, cheap, and a great way to see some of the incredible landscape between cities.While there isn’t an extensive network of trains, you’ll find that the majority of tourist destinations in Morocco are well connected. If you want to do some city hopping and explore places like Marrakech, Fes, Casablanca, Rabat, Oujda, Tangier, or Meknes, just hop on board!Here are is my ultimate guide for traveling by train in Morocco.Where to Buy Train Tickets in MoroccoIn Morocco, it’s easiest to buy your train tickets in person. You can get information on timetables and prices on the ONCF website, then just head to the nearest train station to book your tickets. Be sure to bring cash! You might be able to use your credit cards, but don’t count on it.Most train routes run regularly so it’s rare to have every seat sold out, but it’s good to book in advance if you want to guarantee your spot. The stations are always centrally located and you can buy tickets a few weeks in advance, so just grab ‘em whenever it’s handy. Train Ticket Prices in MoroccoYou can get all of the details on pricing and ticket options at the ONCF website. While the site is only in Arabic or French, the options are pretty straightforward (just open it in your web browser and Google translate will get it into English). You’ll also find that many ONCF staff speak English so they can usually help you out at the station.For every journey, you will have the option of first or second class seats. Prices vary per route but you’ll rarely see first class costing $15+ more than second class.For night trains, you’ve got a choice of sleeper cars. A four-bed couchette costs Dh370 ($38 USD), a single compartment is Dh480 ($50 USD), and a double compartment is Dh690 ($70 USD). Considering it covers your travel and accommodation for the night, it’s super affordable.Travel Times for Popular Train Routes in MoroccoOn some routes, you’ll see an option for “rapide” trains and “ordinaire” trains. Generally, speaking, the rapide trains are around 30% more expensive but much faster.RouteTravel TimeMarrakech to Casablanca3 hours 10 minutesMarrakech to Fes7 hours 10 minutesMarrakech to Rabat4 hours 15 minutesTangier to Marrakech (Overnight train)10 hoursTangier to Casablanca6 hoursCasablanca to Fes4 hoursCasablanca to Casablanca Airport32 minutesRabat to Fes2 hours 30 minutesHelpful  TipIf your cities aren’t connected by train, check out Supratours buses. They’re operated by ONCF and it’s a reliable way to get around. And, after July 2018, there’s going to be a new high-speed (TGV) line to link Tangier, Rabat, and Casablanca.First Class vs Second ClassYou’ll find every train in Morocco divided up into compartments, with six people in a first class compartment and eight people in a second-class compartment. When you book for first-class, you will get a particular seat reserved for you. When you book second class, you’ll just find whatever seat is empty.Since the prices are very reasonable, I’d recommend always opting for first class. You can get travel fare for $20 here. In fact, you can get a seven-day pass for under $100 (with extra discounts available if you’re under 26) that will take you anywhere in the country.If you’re only traveling for two or three hours, the class isn’t really a big deal. When you’re going overnight, first class is essential. Trust me, there’s nothing worse than arriving at your destination tired, sweaty, and hangry.What to Expect on a Night Train in MoroccoI’ll be honest, I was really nervous about the safety of an overnight train in Morocco (traveling as two girls) because there was very little information about it online. But, when I went to purchase my ticket, I realized women traveling solo, with children, or essentially without a male companion, are assigned to women-only cabins.We had a mom with her young child and another single woman in our cabin, and it made for a very relaxed atmosphere. If you decide to take a night train, get the first class sleeper tickets.Generally speaking, the trains are comfy. They provide you with a pillow, a blanket, and a bottle of water. Expect them to be quite hot though, especially in summer. Make sure that you stay hydrated and wear lightweight clothing.While it was a bit warm, I slept like a baby!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/essential-tips-morocco/,Essential Tips for Your First Trip to Morocco,Morocco,"With a rich history, landscape, and culture, Morocco is one of my favorite spots on Earth. From the vibrant red Atlas Mountains to the explosion of colors in the endless markets scattered around the ancient medinas, this place has a unique beauty all its own.For all things boho chic, it’s a dream shopping destination. It’s also a perfect spot for lingering in French-inspired sidewalk cafés or riding a camel into the desert to spend a night under the stars.Ready to explore this North African gem? Here are a few essential tips for your first trip to Morocco.Languages Spoken in MoroccoEnglish, French, Spanish, Arabic, Berber—you’ll hear it all here! On a daily basis, most people speak Darija, or Moroccan Arabic, while the sizable Berber community has their own indigenous language. In official settings, you’ll hear Standard Arabic and French. Spanish is very popular in the north, while English is becoming increasingly popular everywhere.As a traveler, you’ll be able to get by with English, although knowing a few words of French can be very handy.Currency + ConversionThe local cash is the Moroccan dirham. One US dollar will get you just under 11 dirhams. Prices can vary a lot depending on your travel style but, on average, travelers can spend around $40 per day, per person, here.The majority of businesses in Morocco are cash only so make sure you’ve always got enough handy to cover your purchases. The best way to do that is to withdraw cash from an ATM once you get into the country.Read More: Tips for Traveling Morocco on a BudgetGet Phone Data in MoroccoWhile you’ll find that most cafés, restaurants, and hotels in the city have Wi-Fi, it’s handy (and cheap!) to have 4G when you’re exploring the country. You can grab a Maroc Telecom SIM card for only 40 dirhams (just over 4 USD) and get 10GB of data for 100 dirhams (10 USD).Helpful  TipIt can be difficult to source a Maroc SIM card, but your best bet is to check in tobacco shops. Be sure to have them top up your data and check to make sure everything is working before walking away.Male Intimidation in MoroccoThe vast majority of Moroccans are very friendly and will make you feel welcome. However, street harassment is an issue for local women and tourists alike. The best policy is to just ignore it. If men are catcalling, keep moving.It’s also very common for men to offer directions and that can quickly escalate into harassment or demands for money. Don’t feel like you have to be polite to anyone who’s being rude to you. Be firm in saying no and just walk away, if you’re ever feeling uncomfortable.I personally never felt “scared.” It just became incredibly annoying. It’s sometimes worth covering your head and walking quickly through more aggressive areas if you want to avoid it completely.Read More: What It’s Like Traveling As a Woman in MoroccoWhat to Wear in MoroccoOpt for lightweight, loose-fitting clothing. Be sure to always cover your shoulders and knees. Think shawls and maxi skirts. They’re ideal for warm, sunny conditions and it shows respect for the culture- which, in turn, will get you treated with respect.I always carried a scarf or shawl to wear over my shoulders, tie in my hair, or cover my head depending on where my adventures would bring me each day.Read More: What to Pack for a Trip to MoroccoGetting Around in MoroccoTrains are ideal for city hopping. I’d recommend buying first class tickets because they’re not much more than second class and it’s well worth it. In first class, you’ll have a comfortable experience that is comparable to anything you’d find in Europe.They typically offer snacks, but not a huge variety, so it’s usually better to buy what you like in advance and bring it with you. If you decide to take a night train, get the first class sleeper tickets.eIf you’re a solo female traveler or in a group of girls, you’ll be booked into a female-only cabin. We had a mom with her young child and another single woman in our cabin, and it made for a very relaxed atmosphere.Generally speaking, the trains are comfy. They provide you with a pillow, a blanket, and a bottle of water. Expect them to be quite hot though, especially in summer. Make sure that you stay hydrated and wear lightweight clothing.For everything else, taxis are the way to go. You can usually negotiate a price beforehand—especially if you’re looking to travel a long distance. Please keep in mind that driving can be quite dangerous in Morocco, so speak up if your driver is driving erratically.Helpful  Tip: If you want to get off the beaten path, check out the nationally run Supratours buses. They aren’t as fast as trains but they’re cozy and will take you anywhere you want to go.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Traveling by Train in MoroccoI’ve never been to a place that was so vibrant with colors and culture.

The diverse cuisine has so many rich, flavorful dishes. And it’s really easy to find tasty vegetarian, and even vegan, foods.If you’re headed to Morocco, get there hungry! This is a prime spot for a culinary tour.You don’t even have to pack your passport to get good Moroccan grub. Its national specialties have gotten popular all over the world, so if you’re dying of wanderlust, head to your nearest Moroccan restaurant for some exotic tastes.Here are the top traditional foods to try in Morocco!Common Moroccan IngredientsGoat CheeseGoat cheese is in tons of Moroccan recipes, and it’s amazing. If you’re a big fan of goat cheese, I highly recommend that you find a tasting so you can sample several delicious forms.DatesDid you know that there are hundreds of different types of dates? In the US, almost all dates are of the deglet noor variety, which is amazing, but there’s still a wide world full of dates out there that you have to try.OlivesMorocco is home to a wide assortment of olives. The country is one of the world’s biggest olive oil producers, so it is the perfect spot for sampling all kinds of olive varieties.FigI’m actually allergic to figs, so I can’t enjoy them. But, if you’ve never tried fresh figs, you are in for a very nice surprise. Fig Newtons definitely don’t do justice to how delicious these little guys are!AlmondsAlmonds are the foundation of so many tasty things here, especially orange blossom-flavored almond milk (my favorite!) and Moroccan spiced almonds.MeatsMorocco is famous for its incredible meats—from beef to chicken to camel. Tourists clamor to try the meats, which are slow cooked in a tagine.CouscousAnother staple of local dishes is couscous. You’ll find it served with a variety of main dishes, and, in my opinion, it’s always much tastier than rice. Traditional Morocco DessertsFried DoughnutAnother French import, beignets are a pastry lover’s dream. They are similar to fritters, and you’ll find them all over the country sprinkled with powdered sugar.Moroccan SweetsYou’ll find shops full of incredible sweets. Fortunately, a lot of them are bite size, so it’s easy to taste a variety. Of course, you’ll want to grab some shortbread and baklava. My personal faves are almond briouats and pretty much anything doused with orange blossom water.Moroccan CrepeOne import made better by Moroccan ingenuity is the already-amazing crepe. Called mesamen or musamen, this stuff is pure buttery goodness.ZaazaaMade with bananas, apples, kiwis, custard, and random toppings of candies or nuts, this is the ultimate sweet tooth fix.Ready for a sugar high? Grab a zaazaa! Traditional DishesTagineYou can’t go to Morocco without trying tagine! In fact, you’ll probably leave hungry if you try to avoid it. This is the quintessential local dish, and you’ll find it everywhere. There are countless varieties, so do some experimenting.Pastilla (or Bastilla)You’ll find both savory and sweet versions of this dish. The most traditional form features chicken with almonds, and it’s a common delicacy to serve at weddings.Moroccan SoupThis stuff is a dream for anybody with special dietary needs. Chickpea based, this incredibly filling soup is almost always vegan and gluten-free.MeatballsKefta (or kofta) is a popular seasoned meatball that is much loved by the locals, and it is one of Morocco’s most popular fast foods. Other Traditional CuisineSpicesThe spices of Moroccan cuisine are its crowning glory. You’ll see spice shops all over the place offering ultra fresh cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, and so much more. Experiment with different flavors while you’re there, and then pack some up as souvenirs.Argan OilMorocco is home of the world’s beloved argan oil—this stuff is the holy grain. Drip your bread in it. Drizzle it on couscous and pasta. Pour it on your hair. Massage it into your skin. It doesn’t get any more multipurpose than this.Mint TeaUbiquitous in Morocco, mint tea is more than just a beverage.It’s seen as a sign of hospitality, and you’ll be offered it regularly. Since Moroccan tea kettles are usually metal, it’s traditional (and practical) to use handle mitts. They come in a gorgeous array of styles, and they’re a perfect souvenir."

Since 1923, the hotel has welcomed guests from around the world. Everyone from Winston Churchill to Franklin Roosevelt has come to admire the beauty of this Art Deco-meets-Imperial-Morocco hotel.Here’s my experience staying at La Mamounia in Marrakech!The HotelThe hotel is located within seventeen acres of a gated garden, and you’d never know you were in the center of Marrakech here. During the day, you’re surrounded by opulent gardens. At night, the place transforms into a magical garden lit by Moroccan lamps.La Mamounia Marrakech has all of the amenities you’d expect from a luxury resort, like tennis courts, a fitness center, a luxe spa, and outdoor and indoor pools.Unlike in most hotels, however, the gift shop is definitely worth noting here.This place is all about “Morocco’s refined art of living.” It has sumptuous perfumes made exclusively for La Mamounia along with a line of accessories created for the hotel by French designer Barbara Rhil. As I mentioned, I brought home an infuser that literally smells like heaven.Be sure to check out some of its tasty treats made with local olives, argan, and honey too!The RoomsLa Mamounia is one of the world’s most iconic luxury hotels, and you can feel it in all the rooms. They have marble bathrooms, ornate Moorish-inspired title work, and impressive views, and I fell in love the first time I turned the key.This hotel really isn’t overhyped.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-riad-yasmine-in-marrakech/,Staying at Riad Yasmine in Marrakech,Morocco,"The Riad Yasmine in Marrakech is in a league all its own. This boutique hotel is one of Instagram’s most famous spots, and it’s easy to see why. A quiet oasis in the center of the buzzing city, it could easily be one of Morocco’s most impressive riads.While Riad Yasmine’s famous pool gets all of the attention, the entire place is incredible. From chilling on the rooftop and taking in the view of the medina to sipping traditional Moroccan mint tea from the oversized sofas in the lounge, you have to see this place when you are in Marrakech.Here’s my experience staying at Riad Yasmine in Marrakech!The HotelThe solarium on the roof at Riad Yasmine is the perfect spot to start your day. There’s ample room to spread out over the more than 2,200 square feet while you get a view of the city and into the Atlas Mountains.They’ve thought of everything to make the rooftop an ideal spot to unwind. Hanging out of the rooftop is something of a tradition in Marrakech, and it’s a perfect way to pass the time when you need to get off your feet.Relax under a parasol or bask in the sun while you sip on some fresh-pressed juice.Of course, the pool is an incredible hangout as well. According to the owners, a whopping 80 percent of guests come to the riad because they’ve seen pictures of the pool on Instagram and Pinterest.Every inch of the place is Instagram worthy, but don’t listen to me—the pictures speak for themselves!The RoomsRiad Yasmine has only seven rooms, which creates a very cozy environment.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-moving-to-morocco/,The Ultimate Guide to Moving to Morocco,Morocco,"So you’ve decided to move to Morocco—congrats! There are few countries to rival Morocco’s rich diversity of culture, language, music, architecture, landscape and market scents.This country is one of my favorites, and it isn’t difficult for Westerners to move there.There are some adjustments to be made of course, but once you get past these hangups, Morocco’s beautiful and colorful landscape will take you years, if not decades, to explore.Here is a guide to moving to Morocco from our Expat Travel Expert, Wailana!What to Expect in MoroccoMorocco runs on “Mediterranean Time,” meaning that things happen when they happen. While you’re here, it’s best to adjust to a slower, simpler pace—everybody else has.Don’t expect the same standards as in Western countries. Life here is more relaxed and easygoing—but on the flip side, this means that there is garbage on the streets and sometimes restaurants can feel a bit dirty.The FoodThe food is incredible—seriously my favorite country is Morocco almost exclusively due to its food. Fresh bread, colorful spices, countless type of olives, spicy Merguez sausages, Harsha with olive oil, lamb tagine with couscous, kofta tajine…ah, the list goes on and on.EtiquetteOverall, Moroccans tend to be very polite and genuine. They are usually quite curious and open-minded, yet appreciate privacy. There is an intimacy among friends—and even strangers help each other out, giving gifts and kindness without a feeling of reciprocity.Avoiding ScamsHowever, the country does have its fair share of scams, especially in the cities of Tangiers, Casablanca, and Marrakech, so be on the lookout for anyone trying to make a quick buck. People may grab your hand for a henna tattoo, or take you to a cheap carpet shop owned by their cousin. It’s not common, but it does happen. Just be aware. It’s also best to get used that you will spend more than the locals, just by the fact that you’re a foreigner. Shopkeepers, museum docents, and ticket sellers will charge you more.The LanguageIt’s a good idea to pick up some of the local languages here, as many people don’t speak English. Start with Darija, the Moroccan dialect of Arabic—if all else fails you can resort to French or Spanish.Cost of LivingIt’s extremely affordable to live here. Sandwiches will cost you about $2 USD. Almost everything will cost less than in any Western country. This is great news if you earn US Dollars or Euros by remote work, but if you earn Moroccan dirhams expect to live within modest means.Visas and ImmigrationAs a U.S. citizen, you plan to stay in Morocco for more than 90 days, you will need a residence permit (carte sejour) from the immigration office. There are a number of ways you can apply for a residency permit in Morocco, whether you’re a student, married to a Moroccan, employee or pensioner.Ultimately the information changes depending on who, when, and where you ask.It’s best to inquire directly at the immigration office in your district about what exactly you’ll need. Expect to go through a lot of bureaucracy while you’re sorting out your paperwork—Morocco is not known for its organization or communication in the public office!Required documentation, in general, includes application forms, passport photos, criminal background record check, a copy of your passport, birth certificate, bank statement, and medical certificate from a local doctor.You may also need to have a rental contract and a police form, and some of these documents need to be translated into Arabic or French. Of course, if you are applying as a student or an employee, you also have to submit documents that prove your status.Once you have submitted your documents, you will be issued a 3-month temporary residence permit while you are waiting for your official permit. The waiting time varies widely, but expect at least 2-4 months.You can avoid the permit process if you leave the country every 3 months. However, this is generally not recommended as you may encounter a bit of trouble from the authorities. They may require you to stay out of the country for a week or more. Plus the hassle of going to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta (the closest border crossing) every 90 days is a bit annoying.How to Find AccommodationAccommodation is a bit tricky to secure in Morocco. The best way to find one is through word-of-mouth; ask friends, ask around. If you already have a job arranged, ask your employer.Go around in a neighborhood and ask the doormen if there are any open apartments in the buildings. You could also use a real estate agent but the costs can be high; about one month’s rent once you find a place. If all else fails, try the website avito.ma, which lists apartments.Many expats choose Rabat or Marrakesh as their home base.You can either opt to live in the medina, the old part of town, but this usually comes with archaic plumbing and building structure—or choose the more modernized Ville Nouvelle area. Almost every city has one of each.Getting Around MoroccoIt is extremely easy to get around in Morocco if you know the system. There are planes, boats, trains, long-distance buses, grand taxis and petit taxis that will get you practically everywhere. If you’re taking a cab, negotiate the fare in advance.Trains are the most comfortable and quickest but the route limits you to a few select cities. Buses are divided into luxury and local, with the former offering A/C and tend to add more comfort and expense.If you’re traveling between towns for less than an hour, opt for the grand taxi. The price is distributed between passengers, so you can hop in a car that already has 3-5 people heading to your way.Grab a petit taxi for a quick way to zip around within a city.What’s the Expat Community Like?Morocco has been an ethnic melting pot for centuries—here you’ll find Europeans, Berbers, Africans from the south, Middle Easterners, Americans and more.As the crossroads of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, the locals have embraced many customs, dialects, traditions into what is now a rich cultural mishmash. Because of this, the expat community is alive and well and quite close-knit, with neighbors relying on each other for news and info in their adopted home.However, to find them you have to go hunting at first. Sign up for Facebook groups. Try an expat club like the Intercultural Thaqafat Association or the American International Women’s Club of Casablanca. If you have a job, for example, if you work as an ESL teacher, take the time to connect with other teachers.Other Helpful TipsTimeBe patient, and keep your schedule loose. In Morocco, things tend to move at their own pace, and you never know what challenge is going to be next.The HammamTake full advantage of the hammam while you’re there—Moroccan public baths where you can relax, get a vigorous massage, and scrub away all the dirt from your day. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-solo-female-travelers-guide-to-marrakech/,The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Marrakech,Morocco,"Marrakech is a colorful city full of Arabic culture, Berber history, French language, and lively marketplaces!This Moroccan city is a stunning destination and becoming increasingly popular for the sights, cuisine and culture. As a solo female traveler, it is natural to have concerns about putting this place on your to-go to list, but this city is totally worth a visit.Here is my solo female traveler’s guide to Marrakech!Is it  Safe to  Travel Alone in Marrakech?Ultimately, yes. Just like any city in the world, you have to use common sense when traveling alone, as there is always some risk, and you have to take caution. This doesn’t mean you have to be totally paranoid—but don’t forget to follow your intuition and make sure you are prepared for different issues that may arise.As an Arabic society, Marrakech men have different expectations of women. When it comes to being a white woman in Marrakech, you’re going to get unwanted attention. Most of it is completely harmless and just involves men calling out random things to get your attention.Overall, the men in Marrakech are harmless. If you’re a female traveling alone, be smart about it. Walk with confidence, be assertive, and let people know you know how to handle yourself!Read More: What It’s Like Traveling As a Woman in Morocco Where to Go in MarrakechThere are many wonderful day trips and overnight excursions from Marrakech. Just about every tourist stall in the Main Square, Jemaa el Fna, will advertise these, and hostels often organize them too. Prices are very reasonable and will give you priceless experiences!Of the many day trips, one of the most popular it the trip to the Ouzoud Waterfalls in the Atlas mountains. You can spend the day hiking and plunging off waterfalls into the crisp, cool water below.Another option is taking an overnight, or two-night, excursion to the Sahara desert where you can ride a camel, sleep beneath the stars and let the endless sand dunes take your breath away. Head into the Oukira Valley and watch as the landscape changes from brown deserts to a green oasis in a few hours.There is so much to see and do around Marrakech city and the surrounding areas that there is no way you’ll be disappointed!Getting Around MarrakechIt’s pretty easy to get around the city of Marrakech by foot and by taxi. We mostly walked, but I recommend having a map or using a phone with data to use Google maps as some of the directions can be tricky! You can also download offline maps in advance if you know where you will be headed.Marrakech is a safe city to walk around, but take the same amount of caution you would in any other city when out and about. Always keep your purse zipped up and ideally in front of your body, as there are pickpockets like any other popular destination.One important tip is to be mindful of locals trying to scam money from you, by offering directions. Don’t be fooled into thinking it’s an act of kindness, because they will ask for money once at your destination! Just be smart and confident if you’re approached, say you’ve been to Morocco before, and know the way you’re going—even if you don’t, just bluff.City hopping in Morocco is easy and cheap. I took an overnight train from Marrakech to Tangier during my trip and had a good experience. If you’re traveling between Tangier, Fes, Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakech, or any other major area in Morocco, train travel is the way to go.I’d recommend opting for first class tickets since they’re only a bit more expensive than second class and worth the comfort.For spots farther afield, Supratours buses are a great option. It takes a little bit longer but it’s comfy and will take you anywhere you want to go.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Traveling by Train in MoroccoExperiencing Moroccan FoodMoroccan food is full of flavor, with tasty spices and seasonings, and cooked in a unique way. The food is healthy and nutritious, and also really vegetarian-friendly, so you can expect guilt-free feasting!The marketplaces of Marrakech are the best place for a bite to eat. The main square, Jemaa el Fna, comes alive at night in a vibrantly buzzing atmosphere filled with delicious aromas. Walking through the stalls is an experience in itself, as each stall owner tries to grab your attention.The food is essentially the same at each stall, with couscous, tagines, skewers, and traditional salads featuring on all menus. So it’s totally up to you where you sit down…just decide on which street food impresses you the most!Helpful  Tip: While the meat is generally safe to eat, the source is most likely unknown so it is a judgment call if you think it’s fine to eat.Read Next: Traditional Foods to Try in MoroccoWhat to Wear in MoroccoDeciding how to cover up is always a big question when heading to a Muslim country. Marrakech is a big city and a popular tourist destination so it has seen plenty of western travelers, which is an advantage to solo female travelers.However, it is still an Islamic society with a rich culture where women are expected to cover their knees and shoulders. As a western female traveler, it shows respect to put some effort into wearing conservative attire.When planning your outfits, you want to make sure you are comfortable and that you choose something lightweight so you won’t swelter in the heat. To cover your shoulders, a loose top with sleeves is a great option or using a scarf as a shawl to cover up works as well.Read More: What to Pack for a Trip to MoroccoWhat to Wear in Morocco as a Female TravelerWhere to Stay in MarrakechHostels in Marrakech are very reasonably priced and are also centrally located around the main square. The hostels have a comfortable social vibe that you’d expect, plus comfortable spaces to sit and hang out in the Moroccan sun.If you’re traveling alone as a female, hostels are also a great chance to meet people to tackle the marketplace with. Most hostels also organize fun excursions and day trips, so you have the opportunity to get out and explore with fellow travelers and with a local guide.I stayed at two beautiful hotels in Marrakech and would highly recommend them both—Le Riad Yasmine and La Mamounia! "

https://theblondeabroad.com/day-trip-gozo-island-malta/,Day Trip to Gozo Island in Malta,Malta,"While the main island of Malta has amazing nightlife and ultra popular tourist spots, Gozo Island is the perfect place to just unwind. Dotted with sandy beaches and rocky coves, the pace of life is slower here.One of the three main islands that make the Mediterranean nation of Malta, Gozo Island is full of stunning panoramas and historic sites, including one of Malta’s best-preserved prehistoric temples, the UNESCO World Heritage Site site of Ġgantija.If you are headed to Malta, this is one place you can’t miss.  Here’s my experience taking a day trip to Gozo Island in Malta.Getting to Gozo IslandFrom Cirkewwa on the island of Malta, there’s a boat that goes every 45 minutes. It’s year-round but you’ll find that the hours are a bit reduced during the winter.You can grab a round-trip ticket for €4.65. The process is super straightforward and you’ll have no trouble finding anything, including English speaking agents and signage.It takes 30 minutes to get from Malta to Gozo. Once you get across the water, you’ll arrive at Mgarr, a harbor town on the east coast of Gozo Island.Where to Eat & Drink on Gozo IslandMaltese cuisine is an eclectic blend of different Mediterranean influences and there are a lot of tasty treats here. Be sure to hit up at least one bakery or street food stall that’s got pastizzi, a fluffy pastry, or Ħobż tal-Malti, a traditional Maltese bread.Also, keep yours peeled for the famous lampuka fish and Pixxispad, a grilled swordfish, then wash it all down with Ċisk, an ultra popular local beer.Here are a few of the best spots to find all kinds of good food on Gozo Island:Ta’ Philip: This place is famous for its “Made in Gozo” dishes. Their ultra local ingredients and wood burning oven come together to create incredible food. If you’re a wine lover, be sure to go to their Candle Lounge, which is underneath the restaurant and has a great selection of wines.Zeppi’s Pub: For a good atmosphere, drinks, and live music get to Zeppi’s Pub. On top of being a popular hangout for locals, this is a definite upgrade from your standard pub grub.The Flower of Scotland: Another bar with tasty food, this is the place to come for local meat and veggie pies. They’ve even serve fresh vegetable sides, which is definitely a nice surprise from a little pub.The Diamond: They’ve got the best fish and chips on Gozo Island- and that’s saying a lot for a former British colony with UK influences around every corner. Come here to get a meal fit for the Queen.What to DoSightsee in Victoria: The capital city of Gozo Island, this tiny town has a popular of just under 7,000 but it packs a lot into a little space. Known as Rabat or ir-Rabat in Maltese, Victoria is a glimpse into what Malta looked like before it was a tourist hotspot. It’s easy to just wander around and take in the beauty of the town.Be sure to snap some shots of George’s Basilica!The Citadel: A must-see for every visitor to Gozo Island, the citadel has been the center of the island since way back to Neolithic times. It’s a short and sweet tour with good photo ops.Shop: It’s easy to just wander around and do some shop hopping. Pjazza Indipendenza, aka Independence Square aka it-Tokk, is the heart of the shopping area and a place you can’t miss. Mornings are the perfect time to get down to the square for their open air market.Helpful Tip: You’ll find many a few places have a couple of names or more. Sometimes the English name is pretty different from the Maltese name (see: Victoria and Rabat!). It’s not really confusing when you’re there but it can throw you off when you’re planning online.Walk the Main Street: Triq ir-Repubblika, aka Republic Street, is the place to be. It’s got shopping and some pretty spots like the opera house and public gardens.Go Scuba Diving or Snorkeling: There are an endless line of spots to snorkel and, if you like to dive, the MV Karwela Wreck, Double Arch Cave, Blue Hole, and Reqqa Reef are amazing.Visit the Megalithic Temples: Heaven for any history buff, the Ġgantija temples fascinating. They are the oldest Megalithic Temples of Malta and are actually older than the pyramids of Egypt."
https://theblondeabroad.com/day-trip-to-the-blue-lagoon-in-malta/,Day Trip to the Blue Lagoon in Malta,Malta,"Comino Island is a haven for snorkelers, divers, and windsurfers from around the planet. Named after the cumin that grows all over the island, this incredible place is thick with fragrant wild herbs and flowers.While the smell is amazing, the real jewel of this Maltese island is the famous Blue Lagoon.One of the most beautiful beaches in Malta, the the Blue Lagoon on Comino Island is well worth the trip. Located on the tiny, car-free islands of Comino, it’s the perfect Mediterranean escape.Here’s my experience taking a day trip to the Blue Lagoon in Malta!What to ExpectThe boat ride to Comino Island is incredibly picturesque. Have your camera ready for shots of the beautiful caves and sea cliffs along the route there. It’s a quick trip from anywhere in Malta and the journey is Instagram-worthy from beginning to end.As soon as you arrive at Comino Island, you will see how crazy popular this place is. There are always tons of people arriving at once. Normally, anything so touristy puts me off a bit, but this place is worth it.You can’t blame tourists for crowding in to see this gorgeous spot!The Blue Lagoon is shallow. It’s basically a giant swimming pool. The water is calm, shallow, and crystal clear. It’s a good place to snorkel or just enjoy the warm water.Try to get to Comino Island early so you can beat the crowd and maximize your day– it’s all about basking in the sun so try to maximize your hours of daylight.Getting ThereThe Maltese archipelago is made up of three main islands, Malta, Gozo and Comino, along with many smaller uninhabited islands. The big three islands are close together and it’s easy to travel between them so you plan to check them all out even on a short trip.Gozo Island and Comino Island are both less than 30 minutes from the main island of Malta.There are tons of boats and ferries that bring people to Comino Island, however, I’d recommend getting a private charter boat. When you go with a private company, you can arrive early and enjoy the water instead of being stuck on shore. You’ll probably only spend one day boating around Comino Island so it’s best to make the most of it.Other TipsVenders are everywhere: There are food and souvenir vendors on the cliffs that you can reach so feel free to hike around with worrying about having to buy stuff before you go up.They’ve got flamingos: There are inflatable toy salespeople so you can buy a floating flamingos for the water before you grab some Comino Island selfies and send the day wading around.Secure a spot: There are chairs and umbrellas available for rent, but again, get there early to get a good spot!Save some cash: Like most touristy spots, it’s pricey to buy the basics here. Bring your own sunscreen, towel and water so you don’t have to pay marked up rates.Get some peace and quiet: If you want to break away from the crowd for a while, Santa Maria Bay is just a 20 min walk from The Blue Lagoon and it’s got shallow, clear waters. St. Nichola’s Bay is another beach that is about a 20 minute walk and is good for snorkeling. Shop my favorite Malta style essentials!!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1503302495175?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');  READ NEXT: 15 Tips for Traveling Europe Read MoreTen Itinerary Planning Tips for a Trip to EuropeTop 10 Weekend Getaways in EuropeTen European Destinations for Female TravelersHow Much to Budget for Backpacking EuropeThe Beginner’s Guide to Train Travel in EuropeThe Most Romantic Destinations in EuropeThe Ultimate Guide to The Yacht Week ItalyThe Best Time to Go to ItalyTop Romantic Getaways in Italy for Couples"

A tropical paradise famous for its sparkling beaches and world-class diving, Mauritius is a must. When I’m dreaming of a place where I can totally disconnect and forget about the world from the comfort of a private white sand beach, this is precisely the place I have in mind.With a French-speaking mainly Hindu population, this African island is not quite like anywhere else on the continent. One of the safest, most tourist-friendly spots, it’s a perfect introduction to Africa.Looking to plan your dream escape? Here are the top things to do in Mauritius!  Colored Earth of ChamarelVisit the Colored Earth of ChamarelYou’ll definitely want to bring your camera to the Colored Earth of Chamarel.Located in the southwestern side of the island in the Rivière Noire District, this geological wonder is one of the country’s most-loved attractions. Also called Seven Colored Earth, the rainbow of sand here is a fascinating look at millions of years of history. While it’s a fairly small place you can cover quickly, it’s totally worth the trip.  Splurge on a 5-Star ResortI indulged myself in a luxe escape in Mauritius and have been dreaming about it ever since. My experiences at the Constance Prince Maurice in Mauritius and Constance Belle Mare Plage were truly unforgettable. Ready to treat yourself? Here’s a comparison of the two five-star spots to help you decide.Mauritius is one of those places that is all about five-star experiences so go all out here if you can.It’s really a once in a lifetime destination so make the most of every moment with a five-star spot where you’ll feel like a princess.   Hike Le Morne BrabantFor some of the best views of Mauritius, hike Le Morne Brabant. Not only does this UNESCO World Heritage site provide a panoramic ocean view, it has an interesting history as a former sanctuary for runaway slaves.I’d recommend spending some time learning about the complex history of this country and soaking it all in to fully appreciate the island.Explore the Botanical GardenIn Pamplemousses, you will find the oldest botanical garden in the Southern Hemisphere: Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden.Pack a picnic then wander amongst the Giant Water Lilies in this 300-year-old park. There are countless plants used for spices and medicines in the gardens so it’s worth a guided tour if you have time. You will find a few inexpensive options that will teach you a lot.  Go Snorkeling or DivingLocated in the southeast of the island near the airport and a range of hotels, Blue Bay Marine Park is ultra-accessible. This nature lover’s paradise is a dream destination for diving, snorkeling, and just about any other water sport you can think of.Blue Bay Marine Park is famous for its rare and diverse coral. This dynamic network of reefs brings in divers from around the world and as well as a gorgeous range of tropical fish.Plan at least one afternoon, if not all of your afternoons, for appreciating the impressive beaches and seas of Mauritius. After all, that’s what this place is all about!Read More:The Ultimate Guide to Scuba DivingHow to Get Your PADI Open Water Scuba Diving Certification   Check Out Port LouisThe capital of Mauritius is famous for its lovely French colonial architecture. Plan a full afternoon and evening here to mingle with the locals and find those Instagram shots.Walk the Caudan Waterfront to check out the local shops and restaurants as you make your way down to the Central Market. I’d also recommend visiting the Blue Penny Museum to learn more about the culture and history of this isolated island.  Soak in the Black Rivers National ParkIn the dramatic hills of southwestern Mauritius, you will find the lush Mauritian forests filled with the unique native species of animals that call this place home. With thousands of giant fruit bats, nine endemic bird species, and more than 300 species of flowers, Black Rivers National Park is the place to discover African flora and fauna at its best.Take a Trip to Ile aux CerfsIn the largest lagoon of Mauritius, the private island of Ile aux Cerfs has some of the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen in my life.Sometimes simply called Deer Island in English, there are a range of tours that will take you out here or you can go solo with a speed boat. A tour will generally save you a bit of cash and offer lunch and drinks, while a private trip will give you more flexibility to set your own pace.Stay in a Bubble LodgeAs soon as you set foot on Ile aux Cerfs, you’re never going to want to leave. That is when it’s time to find the Bubble Lodge!This is the first and only accommodation on the island. And, as the name implies, you can literally stay in a bubble! With no walls to separate you from the incredible surroundings, this cool concept allows you to connect with nature for a perfect night under the stars.Curious as to what the bubble lodges look like? Why don’t you see for yourself? 🙂   Go on a Jeep Safari in Heritage Nature ReserveBesides the white sand beaches, you’ll find the rugged emerald beauty of the Heritage Nature Reserve. This place is famous for its biodiversity and there’s no better way to learn about it than with a Jeep safari.In addition to its incredible natural beauty, the reserve plays a key role in Mauritian history. Formed by volcanic activity and having a complex past, there’s so much to uncover here. Having a local expert explain it all brings any visit to Mauritius to the next level.Feeling inspired? Here are the best times to travel to Mauritius."

Whether you’re looking to snorkel and see dolphins and sea turtles, hike a jungle trail to a waterfall, or just work on your tan, the island has it all.With a mixture of Indian, French, Chinese, and African influences, this diverse island has something for every traveler.Not sure what the right time to visit? This guide will help you decide when to book those tickets!Here are the best times to travel to Mauritius!  November to FebruaryBecause Mauritius is a tropical destination, it really only has two main seasons: a hot and humid summer and a warm, dry winter.November to February is considered the hot and humid summer.Temperatures average in the mid-80s and you’ll find that these are the prime months for rainfall. In fact, in February and March, you’ll find that it gets quite wet.You will want to keep in mind that January and February are during cyclone season, but due to the island’s location in the Indian Ocean, it usually misses the worst of it. Many of the beach resorts on the island were built with the cyclones in mind so you should be safe. Don’t let this deter you though.The sun never stays hiding for too long in Mauritius.Because of the very warm weather, the months of November to February are considered to be peak season. Port Louis and other smaller towns are filled with tourists but with the warm, calm water (perfect for snorkeling and diving) and sunshine, fighting off the masses just might be worth it.If you’re willing to deal with the crowds, you can have the chance to experience Diwali, a Hindu festival involving lantern displays, fireworks, and tasty treats.Read More:Top Things to Do in Mauritius 20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Mauritius     February to MarchFebruary and March are considered shoulder season in Mauritius.The cyclone season has ended and many of the tourists have gone back home. Booking flights and accommodation during these couple of months can save you up to 40%.Visiting in February and March will also give you the chance to experience some of the celebrations that Mauritius holds. Depending on the year, the Chinese New Year is celebrated in February (though it can happen in January—it all depends on the moon).The event is celebrated with massive firework displays, dragon dances, and plenty of delicious food to munch on.The Holi Festival takes place in February or March and is celebrated with an explosion of colorful powders that are thrown at one another. Ugadi also takes place in March. This New Year celebration of the Telegu group involves prayer, plenty of sweets, and cultural shows for everyone on the island to watch.April to OctoberApril to October, aka the dry winter, is considered to be low season. Though I’m not quite sure why! During these months, you’ll experience cooler temperatures and much smaller crowds. This is the perfect time to visit if you’re on a budget. You can save up to 60% on flights if you visit during the winter.Don’t worry about the term winter, as the lowest the temperature gets is around 70 degrees.This means you’ll still be able to go sightseeing and you’ll be able to enjoy the sunshine on the beach without getting cold. This is also one of the best times to visit if you’re a surfer or a deep-sea fisher, as there are more waves and fish that have migrated than those in the summer months.OverallOverall, there is no “right” or “wrong” time to visit Mauritius.When planning a trip to the island, take a look at your budget and what kind of activities you’re looking to partake in to help you decide! No matter when you visit, you’ll be met with some of the world’s most beautiful beaches and plenty of sunshine.Check out my tropical packing guide before you go!"

If you are planning your adventure in this little slice of paradise lost in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar, the Constance Resort group has got to be at the top of your list.I had the opportunity to check out the famous Constance Belle Mare Plage as well as Constance Prince Maurice. While they both impressed me, some differences were clear that made them appealing to different types of travelers.Here’s how to decide which Constance Resort in Mauritius is your best pick.Constance Prince MauriceConstance Belle Mare PlageResortConstance Belle Mare Plage is a five-star property, and Constance Prince Maurice is actually considered to be a six-star property. While I would normally say that an extra star isn’t always a guarantee that the property is “better,” I did find that Constance Prince Maurice felt higher end.When it comes to group types, Constance Prince Maurice is a dream destination for honeymooners and other couples looking for a romantic escape. Even though Constance Prince Maurice was fully booked during my stay, it always felt uncrowded and we didn’t really see kids running around.If you want an adults-only feel, this is for you. If you are traveling as a family or a group looking for an active holiday, Constance Belle Mare Plage is primo. Note: Both Constance Resorts offer the fun and practical Constance Kids’ Club, which will keep little travelers engaged and happy, so both options can suit kids.Constance Prince MauriceConstance Belle Mare PlageFoodConstance Belle Mare Plage and Constance Prince Maurice both offer full board options which include all meals in the price. I enjoyed the food at both and, of course, when it comes to nosh, everybody is going to have their own tastes so I can’t really pick a definite winner here.Prince Maurice has three good options, one with local picks, an Asian restaurant, and a beautiful floating seafood restaurant.Belle Mare Plage has seven different restaurants and six bars so you will be spoilt for choice here but, I only had eyes for the fab sushi restaurant, Indigo!Constance Prince Maurice Constance Belle Mare PlageRoomsPrince Maurice was the clear premium pick for rooms if you want a five-star plus experience. Don’t get me wrong, Belle Mare Plage is gorgeous, but I’d say that you have to go for one of their premium rooms like the Beachfront Junior Suite if you’re looking for a luxe experience.We stayed in the Junior Suite with Garden View at Prince Maurice and it was just perfect. The room had all of the bells and whistles and it was in a lovely, ultra private space. In addition to this room, they’ve also got larger space for families and groups.If you’re traveling in a large group, however, Belle Mare Plage is your best option. They can accommodate twice as many people and with more options in terms of restaurants, bars, and activities, you have a better chance of finding a crowd-pleaser every day here.Constance Prince MauriceConstance Belle Mare PlageActivitiesIn terms of things to do, it’s going to come down to your group size again. For couples, especially those who love the beach (and, really, you’ve got to adore the sun and sand to make this journey), Prince Maurice is my suggestion.If you want something more high energy with a huge beach to run around on and enjoy, go for Belle Mare Plage.Both options have pools, snorkeling, windsurfing, kayaking, glass bottom boat trips, waterskiing, and golfing, but everything is on a larger scale at Belle Mare Plage.Thanks to Constance Properties for hosting me during my stay.

Every room features a separate living room space as well as oversized marble bathtubs.While the property is undeniably gorgeous, the rooms weren’t quiet as luxe as their nearby sister property, Constance Prince Maurice in Mauritius.

They had amazing sushi with ultra-fresh seafood that I just kept coming back to for every meal.ActivitiesConstance Belle Mare Plage is a dream for ultra active people who love to stay busy. There are ample activity options and a long, sun-soak beach to run around on.When it comes to things to do in Mauritius, it all revolves around the sea. The waters off the island are amongst the most beautiful I have ever seen in my life— and that’s saying a lot from a beach lover like yours truly!Trust me, you just won’t be able to get out of the crystal clear, cozy warm water! Plan on diving, snorkeling, windsurfing, kayaking, glass bottom boat trips, and waterskiing until the sun goes down.Last but not least, the 18-hole championship golf courses at Constance Belle Mare Plage are world-famous and offer stunning views of the nearby forests and volcanic rocks, so I’d definitely recommend checking them out even if you’re a total golf newbie. Even if you’re not a serious golfer, there’s a cute mini golf course on the property.The Constance Belle Mare Plage is also a very family friendly spot. The Constance Kids Club will keep your junior explorers busy with countless fun activities!More InformationResort: Constance Belle Mare PlageLocation: MauritiusAccommodation: Resort, Family FriendlyPrice Range: $$-$$$Thanks to Constance Belle Mare Plage for hosting me during my stay.

The staff always remembered my name, and were ready to find a way to enhance my experience at every turn.In fact, it was some of the best customer service that I have experienced in any hotel. They picked us up from airport in a Wi-Fi equipped car and even had macaroons to welcome us!During my Mauritian sojourn, I also spent 3 nights at their sister property, Constance Belle Mare Plage, which was another top accommodation choice.The RoomsDesigned by esteemed local architects and designed on Feng Shui principles, there are 64 junior suites, 12 family suites, 12 villas, or the lavish princely suite to choose from. We stayed in the Junior Suite with Garden View in a stunning area of the resort beside a pool that was always quiet and inviting.I adored the space.

There are three different restaurants to choose from, and they all impressed me.There’s L’Archipel, overlooking the pool and the beach, with a classic Mauritian menu.

Made up of hundreds of islands on 26 coral atolls, this stunning nation is a tropical paradise in the truest sense.The Maldives entered into global tourism only 30 years ago and things are changing. While isolated resorts used to be the only option for travelers, tourists are now allowed to stay among locals and gain an insight into Maldivian life and culture.Another draw of the island destination is the world-class diving locations and conditions they provide. Since I recently got my advanced PADI diving certification in Playa Del Carmen, I was anxious to dive as much as I could.I got a chance to see the local culture and get in all the diving I wanted to at the Boutique Beach All-Inclusive Diving Hotel on Dhigurah island.Here’s why Boutique Beach Hotel in the Maldives is a diver’s dream come true!Dhigurah IslandFew people have ever had the chance to see the “real” Maldives but you can see it all on a trip to Dhigurah. The Maldives has a culture unlike anywhere else on the globe and exploring Dhigurah Island is the perfect way to get a sense of daily life there.Before you start your adventure, it’s important to remember that the Maldives is a Muslim country. This means that you have to cover your chest and thighs at all times outside of the hotel areas so be sure to pack accordingly. Think long, flowy dresses.The weather is rarely below 75 degrees so bring a few lightweight, full-coverage options so you can explore the islands.Boutique Beach has done a great job of integrating its guests preferences with local culture by allowing a sun bathing deck as well as a section of beach where you’re free to rock your bikinis freely.With the azure water and lush white-sand beaches, its like staying in a postcard!The HotelRated an impressive 9.4 on Booking.com and awarded a TripAdvisor Certificate of Excellence, this intimate six-room guesthouse is one of two hotels on the island, and has everything that you need for the perfect diving getaway.Each guest can choose to go out diving up to three times daily- it’s all included!Everyday the hotel provides breakfast, lunch and dinner, as well as tea and cookies in the afternoon. My favorite was the rooftop deck where dinner is served, and you can watch the famous Maldivian sunsets from- cookies in hand, of course!The RoomsFirst and foremost, I can’t tell you how much I loved the outdoor showers in each room at the Boutique Beach. It was like stepping into an exotic shampoo commercial every day.The attention to detail in the rooms was also second to none. From complimentary beach tote bags, to USB charging units and a tea station, every little aspect of the room was flawless and the staff was endlessly helpful and friendly.Diving Around DhigurahSurrounded by protected waters and top-notch dive spots, the Boutique Beach is heaven for beach lovers. Whether you are an experienced diver or a total newbie, the amazing dive staff and their impressive PADI dive shop have got you covered.The Boutique Beach is run by divers for divers- all local Maldivians- and their passion is obvious.Located next to a whale shark protected area in the Maldives, the Boutique Beach has earned its bragging rights. Its striking manta point and coral-covered deep reefs make for some of the most remarkable diving you will find anywhere on the globe.Swimming with Whale SharksOf the many places around the world these beautiful, giant creatures call home, the Maldivian waters are a perfect home for these creatures as the strong currents carry in plankton-rich, and create a perfect breeding ground for them.Dhigurah island is located right next to Maamigili Whale Shark Sanctuary where the whale sharks are safe from harmful fishing and irresponsible tourism practices.Getting to swim with whale sharks has been on my bucket list as long as I can remember.Thanks to the awesome crew from Boutique Beach, I was able to cross it off my list!More InformationHotel: Boutique Beach All-Inclusive Diving HotelLocation: Dhigurah Island, The MaldivesAccommodation: Dive Resort, All-InclusivePrice Range: $$Want to earn points for your hotel stays and earn miles toward your next adventure?"

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-meeru-island-resort-maldives/,Staying at Meeru Island Resort & Spa in the Maldives,Maldives,"The epitome of lush tropical getaways, the Maldives offers unrivaled paradise. I was able to spend a day at Meeru Island Resort & Spa during my short time exploring the Maldives and got a sample of the island property. If you are ready for an affordable, tropical getaway…pack your bags for the private oasis of Meeru Island Resort & Spa in the Maldives!Meeru Island ResortSurrounded by turquoise waters and colorful marine life, Meeru is a beach lover’s dream come true. The only resort on the island of Meerufenfushi, the Meeru Island Resort & Spa has a lot to offer those who want to experience the Maldives without breaking the bank.Sunset cruises, top-notch diving in the surrounding atoll, and white-sand beaches made for a great stay and some much-needed relaxation.The staff’s warm, friendly Maldivian hospitality made the stay even better.The Rooms at MeeruThe Meeru Island Resort & Spa has a large collection of rooms. You can choose from Garden rooms, Beach Villas, Jacuzzi Beach Villas, Water Villas, or Jacuzzi Water Villas. I stayed in the Jacuzzi Water Villa, which sat over the water in the iconic bungalow style, and loved waking up to the views.My villa had a private, walled-in outdoor area with a Jacuzzi, chaise lounges and a private sundeck and shaded area. To top it all off, I had an amazing partially open-air bathroom with a rain shower and little features like my own espresso machine.Duniye Spa on MeeruAfter splashing around for hours in the sea, I went over to recharge at the Duniye Spa. This serene, exotic spa combines cutting edge technology with ancient oriental traditions to create the ultimate spa experience.The staff members are pros at all of our spa favorites and offer dozens of blissed-out exotic treatments you’ve got to try.The spa provides holistic spa treatments with a high-touch and low-tech approach.

Obviously, number one and two on the list are snorkeling and diving in the surrounding waters.One of the best amenities, in my opinion, is that they offer a complimentary boat excursion to the house reef for snorkeling excursions. There is also a snorkeling trail located at the northern tip of the island where you can see beautiful tropical fish along the way.Other water sports include windsurfing, catamaran, kayaking and glass-bottom boat explorations.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>More InformationHotel: Meeru Island Resort & SpaLocation: Meerufenfushi, North Male’ Atoll in the Republic of MaldivesAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$Special thanks to Meeru Island Resort & Spa for hosting me as their guest.

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-wellness-travel-guide-to-tulum-mexico/,"The Ultimate Wellness Travel Guide to Tulum, Mexico",Mexico,"Ah, Tulum. Mexico’s slice of paradise on the Caribbean Coast.In recent years Tulum has become the place to go for boho vibes, pristine beaches, delicious and health-focused food, yoga and a very relaxed party scene. Alex of Roam & Thrive is here to give us the low-down with her wellness travel guide to Tulum, Mexico!Since I first visited Tulum, it’s been my go-to place for complete rest, rejuvenation and relaxation and I’ve been exploring everything it has to offer since.I personally like to spend at least a week there to fully enjoy everything on offer at a relaxed pace as well as being able to completely unwind.From where to stay to places to eat and all the major highlights in between, here’s the ultimate wellness guide to Tulum!The Best  Time to VisitTulum enjoys a warm and tropical climate all year round, making it a great place to visit at any time of year.The high season which is also the dry/winter season runs from November-April when temperatures are pleasant. You can also expect high season crowds and high prices from June-August.Low season/rainy season, runs from September-December. Prices fall dramatically during this time and you’ll no doubt be able to snap up a great deal. It’s my favorite time to go as there are fewer people and while it does rain sometimes, it’s not enough to dampen your spirits or your beach fun.  Getting AroundAs soon as you arrive in Tulum you’ll notice that the town isn’t as close to the beach as you might have thought. In fact, the area is split up into the ‘Tulum town’ area and the ‘Tulum beach’ area.If you want to explore the whole area as well as visit some impressive cenotes and ruins you’ll need transportation.BicycleThere are many places to rent a bicycle both on the beach strip and on the main avenue of Tulum town. Not only is it a great way to get around, but it’s also a great form of exercise. In general, Tulum is a safe place to cycle with special bicycle lines in town keeping you well- away from the traffic.ScooterMexico moved away from motorbike culture a while ago but scooter rental is still available from a few places in Tulum town. It’s a great way to get between the beach and the town or to the ruins or nearby cenotes.CarIf you plan to explore further than the immediate area renting a car is a great idea. You can rent a car from the airport in Cancun or from local agencies in Tulum town and it’s pretty easy to do so, just bring your passport as a deposit.ColectivoFor the cheapest way to get around the local area, use a colectivo, a shared, local minibus. They depart when full and they’ll be able to take you to destination along the Tulum-Cancun highway which includes some great cenotes and the Tulum ruins. Colectivos depart from the Tulum-Cancun highway/beach road junction. Helpful Tip:One thing to keep in mind when renting a car or scooter is a popular gas station scam; always watch the meter and make sure it reads zero before they fill up your tank and try to pay with the smallest note you have. Vendors may try to swap your large note for a smaller one when you’re not looking so they end up giving you less change.  Where to StayTulum has a plethora of beautiful properties for every budget. As a general rule, more budget accommodation options are located in Tulum town and the more luxurious properties on the beach strip.Olas TulumOlas is one of the only truly sustainable hotels in Tulum. It’s a small, boutique hotel with only a handful of suites located right on the beach.It’s bright, clean, airy and secluded and it’s perfect if you’re looking for a more private and personal beach break. The property is entirely powered by solar energy and they capture and reuse rainwater for the villa’s showers.Alaya TulumA mixture of rustic and hippie charm with a wellness center on your doorstep, Alaya is an excellent option in Tulum. They offer gorgeous suites with an ocean or garden view, delicious breakfasts and daily yoga for which you don’t have to leave the property.Nahouse Jungle LodgesFor a more budget option in the jungle just outside Tulum town, this property feels anything but budget. It consists of four loft apartments all surrounding a clear, natural pool amid lush jungle vegetation.Each lodge is beautifully adorned and self-contained including a kitchen for those interested in self-catering. They also rent bicycles for the easy ride to the beach. Tulum Ruins Gran Cenote What to DoWhile spending some time on the beach should definitely be on your agenda in Tulum, there is still quite a bit to see outside of the town and the beach resorts and I highly recommend you take at least a day to explore.Tulum RuinsLocated just 4km outside of Tulum, the Tulum ruins are a must-see, especially if you’re not planning a trip to more distant Chichen Itza.You can visit and walk around at your own rhythm or hire a guide to learn more about the history and significance of the ancient Mayan site. The site was the only Mayan citadel located on the coast and it served as the main port for the entire empire. To this day, you can still notice some of the exquisite carvings on the temple walls.Top Tip: Bring your swimwear and towel. Yes—to the ruins! The ruins are actually located above one of the most stunning beaches in the area. You can descend down the cliff and cool off in the refreshing sea below while enjoying the spectacular surroundings full of local history.Visit Some CenotesCenotes are natural sinkholes located all over the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.They were used by the Mayans as places of worship and sacrifice and now they make excellent places to cool off after a day of exploring. Each cenote has a different feel to it, and no two are the same.You could spend days just cenote-hopping.The closest and most popular cenotes to Tulum are Grand Cenote and Cenote Calavera which you can reach by bicycle.If you have a car you can also check out Cenote Dos Ojos and Tak Be Ha (within the same complex) and Cenote Azul, Cenote Cristalino and Cenote Jardin del Eden located on the highway between Tulum and Playa del Carmen.My personal favorite cenotes are situated around the Yucatan colonial town of Valladolid.Not only are the entrance fees much lower, but they are also more varied; these cenotes are gorgeous, and at times, less crowded. My favorites in this area are Cenote Suytun, Cenote Oxaman, and Cenote Ik-Kil. If you have a rental car I’d highly recommend a day trip to Valladolid.Check out this map for all the recommended cenotes!Take a Day Trip to Sian Ka’an ReserveThis biosphere is a divine wildlife and nature refuge located immediately south of Tulum.You’ll have to take a tour to visit this area as it’s highly protected but you can expect to potentially see the unique marsh landscapes as well as monkeys, crocodiles, iguanas, flamingos and a variety of different bird species.ShoppingTulum is a brilliant place for boho-chic clothing and swimwear, homeware, and natural cosmetics. You’ll find tons of incredibly beautiful boutiques located along the beach strip and you could easily assign one afternoon to just shopping.  Chill on the Beach in StyleSome of the best parts of Tulum beach belong to the resorts built behind them—but that doesn’t mean you can’t relax there for the day.These hotels have beach bars right on the beach where you can relax in a comfortable lounger/beach hut for the day. All you have to do to be able to stay there is order some food or drink. Note that some of the more exclusive properties have a minimum spend per head.My favorite beach clubs are Coco Tulum and Casa Malca. Cenote Dos Ojos Cenote Calvera Wellness HighlightsThe health and wellness scene in Tulum is fully established and thriving and can be compared to that of Bali. It’s really the place to go in the Americas to indulge in wellness activities and healthy eating.Meditation/Sound HealingPause and de-stress from everything that is life with some daily meditation and sound healing.Azulik: The perfect place to relax and unwind the mind. Sound healing and meditation classes occur daily, which leave you feeling refreshed and completely at ease with yourself and your surroundings.Yaan Healing Sanctuary: Yaan specializes in many types of healing rituals but they also do daily yoga and meditation packages. Their space is completely open and overlooks the pristine jungle canopy so inevitably your daily practice will be accompanied by all the birdsong and hum of the jungle.  YogaThere are countless places in Tulum to do yoga, some of them are right on the beach. Most classes are in the morning, at about 7.30/8 am and some places have another class at about 5 pm, depending on the time of year.Sanara Tulum: A beautiful, light and airy studio ideal for some morning or afternoon stretching to the sound of the waves.Alaya Tulum: Alaya has daily morning and afternoon classes up in their divine, natural and rustic studio above reception right on the Tulum Beach strip. During low season you might even be the only person in the class and get a fully personalized yoga experience.Azulik: For a yoga experience in one of the world’s most unique boutique hotels, Azulik’s yoga barn is made entirely of natural materials allowing you to flow to the morning sun and birdsong surrounded entirely by the natural.Cacao RitualA wellness experience unique to Mexico. During Mayan times cacao was a sacred drink of the gods and if you’re not yet familiar with a cacao ritual I highly suggest you try it. It’s based upon rejuvenation, balance and new opportunities.Through drinking of the cacao, the ceremony aims to clear old energies to make space for new ones as well as aiming to open the heart and becoming more attuned to its murmur.Healing Tulum: Healing Tulum offers both group and individual cacao ceremonies that allow you to experience this unique ritual. They also do massages, spa treatments, yoga, and meditation.Casa Violeta: A gorgeous beach setting for a reviving and deepening cacao ceremony.Working OutJungle Gym: For those that would like a high-intensity gym experience during their stay Jungle Gym is probably the most unique gyms out there…everything is Flintstone-style.Benches are made from wooden planks and weights from wood, bamboo or stone- talk about sustainable! Enjoy a workout here and you’ll never look at another gym in the same way again.Go for a Beach Run: You are on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world, so what better way to enjoy it than a morning jog to the sound of the crashing waves?  Where to EatTulum is where healthy, nutritious food meets authentic Mexican cuisine and there are so many great eating options both in the town and on the beach strip.Antojitos La ChiapanecaThe ultimate place for authentic Mexican tacos and a local price to boot. Their tacos are to die for and all some with the typical spicy Mexican salsas. You can order any filling you want and they even have a vegetarian black bean one. Raw Love Farm to Table Raw LoveFor raw, vibrant and living foods come straight to Raw Love. It’s right off of the beach surrounded by sand, trees and beach huts and it is the perfect place to grab a salad, acai bowl or green smoothie post-yoga. I tried the raw pad thai and it was heavenly.Farm to TableA wonderful place to head to for brunch in Tulum town, their concept of using farm to table ingredients can do no wrong. Due to this, they have a monthly changing menu that uses seasonal and local produce. I highly recommend their pancakes, coffee, and fresh juices.Matcha MamaGreat smoothies, juices, and acai bowls. A perfect refreshment pit-stop.NU TulumOne of the best places to go for a special or romantic dinner in Tulum. Beautifully lit in the evening, the menu is limited and specialized but really focused on perfecting each and every dish. You can find a variety of seafood dishes, meats, vegetables, and ceviches all with a modern Mexican twist. Top Tips for Visiting TulumBug RepellentBring bug repellent! Tulum is essentially located in the jungle so mosquitoes can be a real problem here, especially in the rainy/low season. Don’t forget to use it plentifully especially ahead of dawn or dusk yoga classes or meditation.Have Cash On-HandBring Mexican pesos. US dollars aren’t really used and ATMs can be hard to find especially if you’re staying near the beach strip. Credit cards are widely accepted.While I was in Tulum I heard a lot about some of the ATMs being a little dodgy. Try to avoid small, hole-in-the-wall ATMs and instead look for ones attached to large banks. In town, there is an HSBC bank with two reliable ATMs inside.Visit the Cenotes EarlyCenotes, especially the ones in the Tulum area can get very busy throughout the day. If you’re looking to have a more peaceful experience or you’d like to take photos, I’d recommend getting there as early as possible. Most open between 8-9 am.Don’t forget your towel!To find out more about the Tulum area or Yucatan Peninsula, I suggest having a look at some of the following articles that can be found on my blog, Roam & Thrive.Tulum Ruins: A Short Guide and Top Tips for VisitingYour Quick Guide to the Best Cenotes in Tulum6 Must Visit Cenotes Around ValladolidThe Ultimate Guide to Things to Do in Valladolid, Mexico"

https://theblondeabroad.com/wine-tasting-in-valle-de-guadalupe-in-mexico/,Wine Tasting in Valle de Guadalupe in Mexico,Mexico,"Mexican wine? Yes, please! While you might not have heard of it, the highly underrated Valle de Guadalupe region of Mexico has some incredible vinos. On my latest trip back to North America, I had a dream wine tasting adventure south of the border and got to try all of the best Mexican vintages.About two hours south of San Diego, on the northern Baja California peninsula, you’ll find the impressive wine selection of Valle de Guadalupe.Simply referred to as Valle by the locals, this region has more than 100 wineries producing renowned vintages. Plus it’s a foodie’s ultimate destination!Valle de Guadalupe in Mexico is home to countless artisan cheese makers, craft breweries, olive oil producers, and farm to table restaurants. With a gorgeous location beside the Pacific Ocean, this region is blessed with prime seafood.Here’s everything you need to know about wine tasting in Valle de Guadalupe in Mexico.The Wine Tour in Valle de GuadalupeYou can explore Valle de Guadalupe solo or with a tour company. We opted to go with Baja Wine and Food.They offer crafted experiences and showed us the best of the best. Our guide was Fernando Gaxiola and he impressed us at every turn. He took care of us from beginning to end and made sure that we were having exactly the experience we wanted. He was also a local wine superstar!Every place that we went, everybody knew him. While you can have a good solo expedition, going with a local “in the know” gave us an insider’s point of view.Our wine tasting tour of Valle de Guadalupe with Baja Wine and Food cost around $195 USD per person, which included all wine tasting, food, and the transfers to and from our villa.Encuentro Guadalupe WineryThe best way to start your Mexican wine tasting excursion is with a cellar tasting at Encuentro Guadalupe. This four-star hotel offers world-class wine and delicious food. While we only came for the wine, this is one of the coolest hotel properties in Valle. Individual eco-lofts sit on top of the hill and overlook the entire valley.Encuentro is the perfect stop for an introduction to Mexican Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Nebbiolo.Adobe GuadalupeNext up, the Adobe Guadalupe’s Private Cellar offers an impressive lineup of wines. We went for the VIP Wine Experience, which I’d highly recommend if you’re traveling in a group of four or larger.Be sure to also check out the locally produced olive oil!After working up an appetite from all of the wine tasting, we stuck around Adobe Guadalupe for a tapas lunch. It is a stunning property and they served us lunch from a cool little tapas-airstream food truck.If you don’t make it there for lunch, you have the option of adding on appetizers or high tea to your tasting.Finca La CarrodillaThis family-owned eco-friendly winery offers four impressive single varietal wines. Finca La Carrodilla’s Chenin Blanc, Shiraz, Cabernet, and Tempranillo are all very much worth a try.Since our guide was very connected in this region, he was able to set up a personal wine tasting in a private room with the winemaker himself. The winemaker was able to sit with us and explain his personal connection to each wine we tried. I also LOVE the branding and labels of the wine here– I bought their entire collection!I highly recommend booking this unique experience if you are able to!Dinner at a WineryUnder a 100-year-old oak tree in the heart of Valle de Guadalupe, you can enjoy an ultra fresh and local family-style dinner at Animalón. While the food here alone would make it worth the trip, the picturesque location is what really makes for an unforgettable night.Just off the coast, TrasLomita is another great dinner pick with outdoor dining. This Mediterranean inspired restaurant offers the freshest seafood, produce straight from their garden out back, and world-renowned wine.Sunset CocktailsFor a drink with a view, it’s all about Cuatro Cuatros. In this little resort space nestled amongst vineyards and mountains, you’ll find Bar V. Bura.The platform deck there offers a stunning view of the ocean. While it is a bit out of the way, it’s well worth it (just be sure to make a reservation in advance).This was truly the perfect way to end our incredible day wine tasting all over Valle de Guadalupe!"

The ferry trip only takes about thirty minutes.Another option is to take an air taxi from Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, or Cancún.Day 2 — Exploring Isla Holbox with the LocalsOn our second day, we wanted to get acquainted with the island so we rented some bikes and explored! The beaches are so incredibly beautiful and the sun is HOT.We chowed down on fresh ceviche while sipping on some refreshing cold cervezas.Day 3 — Searching for Whale Sharks in Isla HolboxOn day three, we got up super early and took a boat out to see if we could find some whale sharks! It was the very first day of whale shark season, so chances of seeing them was slim, but the trip was awesome regardless. We had a ton of fun snorkeling and exploring by boat.At night, we found an amazing little restaurant right on the beach, then explored the street food scene. After a churro, we tucked in early for the night!Day 4 — Last Day in Isla HolboxOn our last morning in Isla Holbox, we did a little shopping, a little brunching and a little swinging on some hammocks on the beach. It was the perfect end to a perfect short trip!We caught our ferry and bus back to Playa del Carmen where we hit the town and met up with some old friends for one last fiesta.For more of my travel vlogs, check out The Blonde Abroad on YouTube!READ NEXT: The Ultimate Isla Holbox Travel GuideRead More20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Isla HolboxThe Best Girlfriend Getaways Around the WorldThe Best Beach Getaways for CouplesTips for Traveling Mexico in the SummerTop Ten Things to Do in Mexico’s Yucatan PeninsulaThe Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to the Yucatan Peninsula in MexicoTen Essential Tips For Solo Female TravelersThe Ultimate Guide to Solo Female Travel"

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-traveling-mexico-summer/,Tips for Traveling Mexico in the Summer,Mexico,"For decades, Mexico has been a favorite summer destination. It’s no wonder why though, as it has affordable prices, tropical beaches and cuisine, and a variety of activities!Throughout Mexico, you’ll find many different cultures, locals, and even food, as it is a diverse country. From the tip of Baja California to the Yucatan Peninsula, you can spend weeks exploring the country, and still not experience everything it has to offer the traveler.Here’s my quick guide to traveling Mexico in the summer!Weather & PackingMexico enjoys warm temperatures year-round, with summer a perfect example of 80-degree sunshine. Mexico’s all about sun, so don’t forget to pack your sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses—and remember to drink lots of water.Wear insect repellent to scare away those nasty mosquitoes. I recently discovered an all-natural spray that protects you from bugs and natural elements- check out “Cactus Juice“!Since the heat and humidity can be daunting at times, avoid the worst of the humidity by dressing in breathable fabrics like linen and cotton.AccommodationThere’s no end to accommodations in Mexico—it all depends on your budget and your expectations.From five-star resorts to economical hostels, there’s something for everyone. Low season starts in late spring, so book your hotel in May for the best deals.Helpful Tip: Try to avoid the winter (especially around Christmas and New Year) as this is the peak season.ActivitiesMexico offers a wide selection of activities depending on where you are. In Cancun, try your hand at paragliding, scuba diving, snorkeling, and yachting; in Puerto Vallarta, you may fancy a game of high-stakes golf.More into history? Book a tour of the incredible Mayan ruins at Tulum, or spend a day wandering the Spanish colonial streets of San Miguel de Allende.Read Next: Top Ten Things to Do in Mexico’s Yucatan PeninsulaBudgetMexico is a terrific option for summer travelers on a budget as prices tend to be way lower than in the United States. You’ll want to find a good deal on a hotel early and spend your time wandering the beaches for live music festivals and day parties.Depending on where you’re flying from, roundtrip tickets to Cancun can be as low as $200. If you like to pamper yourself, splurge on the hotel—many top-star places offer excellent spas. If you’re more into the activities, invest in making some memories.You can usually book great excursions through your hotel at the concierge desk—awesome activities including zip lining, diving, snorkeling, boating, and seeing Mayan ruins.FoodBreak away from the tacos and burritos mold to savor Mexican cuisine as you’ve never tasted it before. Each region boasts its own local specialties, from Mayan-inspired cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork with bitter orange marinade) to pan dulce and melt-in-your-mouth churros.Read Next: Where to Find the Best Food in Mexico CitySafetyDon’t forget to take all of that common sense on your trip that you have lying around! Know your limits when it comes to alcohol and always try to party with friends.Even the tranquil beaches of Cancun can have off days… look for those red or black beach flags, which spell out danger for swimmers and surfers. Most beaches do not have lifeguards, so you’re on your own here.

https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-tulum/,Where To Find The Best Food in Tulum,Mexico,"Tulum was a destination that certainly surpassed my expectations.  I thought Tulum was just going to be some touristy feeling stereotypical Mexican destination with too many Americans and not enough spark.  I was completely wrong.What Tulum actually is is an awesome place for a long weekend getaway, chalk full of white sand sprawling beaches and turquoise waters, incredibly unique restaurants and a night scene that’s sexy and dreamy all in one.The main part of Tulum (though not the authentic, original side of Tulum) is based around one very long dirt road, with the beach in front of it and the jungle behind it.  Every hotel and restaurant obviously sits on one side or the other, giving each venue maximum chill beach vibes or a funky jungle feel.  Roll out of your hotel onto the beach by day, drop in a yoga session or two, eat a taco, swim in a cave, plan for the night with some help from the below, and then get out there and have some fun. The following restaurants are ranked in order of my overall enjoyment of them though really, all were pretty damn impressive.  Here’s where to find the best food in Tulum!El CamelloDusty cement floors, white plastic chairs, no frills- this roadside joint was totally authentic (it’s outside of the main strip of Tulum, in the less developed town).Founded by local Mexican fisherman, at El Camello is all fish, all the time.  Your main choices focus around ceviche, pulpo, and whole fish, all of which can be ordered literally by the boatload, feeding a huge, hungry group without flinching.  Casa JaguarI loved it here.  The quirky and cool jungle-like ambience, the creative (though somewhat sweet) drinks, the inventive and highly flavorful dishes.  I’m putting Casa Jaguar at the very top of my list, which is quite a feat considering how impressed I was overall by the chic dining scene in this small but bustling coastal town in Mexico.  For some reason the wait for a table was actually the shortest here; in whatever you read, it is often suggested to put your name down at Hartwood and then wander down the street to Casa Jaguar for drinks.  I’d scratch that- go to Jaguar for food and drinks, definitely not just the ladder. The scallop crudo was incomprehensibly good, peppered with juices and spices that brought this fish to life in a way I didn’t realize possible.  The ceviche was diced with apples, corn nuts, cabbage, onions and topped with sprouts.  It was excellent.  And the whole fish was smothered with rosemary, olive oil, salt, pepper, potatoes and lemons, making this take on the usually chicken-centric dish work incredibly well.  Make sure you get yourself the mashed plantains, too- they’re out of this world. Posada MargheritaPosada Margherita truly is just that; a restaurant that essentially feels like a beautiful, warm, rustic and meticulously decorated home, with Italian food at its core.  Like so many others in Tulum, the setup is open-air and the turquoise Gulf waters hover at the end of your line of site, making the space even more breathtaking than it already is.  Dozens of candles light the sprawling space, making way to white-washed tables, an art-deco kind of garden out back, and a boutique store in the front.  An impressive bread and cheese board is every table’s greeting, the rosemary focaccia being a stand out.  The menu is intimate, and the pastas are what rule.  Posada is a must-do when in Tulum. GitanoGitano is awesome.  It’s a restaurant, mezcal bar, and a dance floor with a live DJ situation, all in one.  Even though you’re in the jungle, the vibe and look of the bar at Gitano is pure New York, in the best possible way.  The bar is the centerpiece here, with low lit shelves stocked with bottles and a sexy group of bartenders serving from them.  The rest of the space is used for dining and while the food was not the best I had in Tulum, Gitano still made its mark overall.  Coqui CoquiIf in the future I find myself with the opportunity to stay at Coqui Coqui, I absolutely will.  While this time around I did not get the chance to see what any of the seven rooms at this boutique hotel looked like, based on the rest of the design and feel here, I can guarantee that they are immaculate.Walk into Coqui Coqui and you immediately have a feeling of calm, serenity, style and fiercely good taste.  I had both breakfast and lunch here (they do not offer dinner), each meal fulfilling the desire for fresh and flavorsome food, with the sand as your floor and the water again as your view.  The polpo here was mixed with goat cheese, cabbage, spinach and grape tomatoes, and it was my favorite of the week.Read Next: The Ultimate Tulum Travel Guide Read MoreWhere to Find the Best Food in Mexico CityThe Ultimate Guide to Solo Female TravelTop Ten Things to Do in Mexico’s Yucatan PeninsulaThe Best All-Inclusive Resort in Riviera Maya: El Dorado Casitas RoyaleThe Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to the Yucatan Peninsula in MexicoSHOP these Mexico travel essentials!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){ var e, p; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js'; var cb = new Date().getTime(); p += '?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-mexico-city/,Where to Find the Best Food in Mexico City,Mexico,"Mexico City means a lot of different things, to a lot of different people. Some people think street food and tortas, some people think museums, and others regrettably think it is a city that is off limits.Over the years Mexico City has garnered a reputation for itself that often has tourists saying, no thank you. In reality, this sentiment could not be further from the truth. It is the former, and certainly not the latter descriptives, that has a new wave of people flocking to this charming city.The artfulness of the streets, buildings and parks, the pure and palpable friendliness of the people, the care and creativeness put into the design of every bit of space, and of course the distinctiveness found in its culinary creations, made this one of the most memorable places I have ever been.From $1 tacos and tostadas found in sprawling, local markets, to more serious spots that have international fame and acclaim, the food here left a major mark.I could have spent weeks exploring and eating my way around the otherwise named DF (Distrito Federal)… but I only had five days this time around, but as always, I packed it in and safely feel I can say I enjoyed some of the best this city had to offer.Here are some of the highlights of the best food in Mexico City! PujolLocated in the somewhat chic Polanco district, Pujol is sleek, chic and has a rather minimalist setting. Pujol is one of the higher end spots in Mexico City, offering a set tasting menu by acclaimed Chef Enrique Olvera.It’s also ranked at an impressive #15 on The World’s 50 Best List, which means expectations start high and you just hope they end up getting met. Crunchy insects (do it!) play a big role here, and you’re likely to see versions of avocado and mole pop up throughout.Each dish was aesthetically unique as well as gastronomically complex, and all was seemingly handled with ease, precision, and remarkable taste to match. Maximo Bistrot and Lalo!Chef Eduardo Garcia of DF’s Pujol and NYC’s equally acclaimed Le Bernardin set out to make his own culinary mark in 2012, and with the opening of Maximo Bistrot he did just that.Maximo Bistrot is sleek and simple, but also invokes a feeling of cool and sophisticate. Set on a corner in trendy La Roma, a late dinner at Maximo blew us away and made us fall more in love with the city than we already had. This was one of my favorites.Down the street you’ll also find Lalo!, Garcia’s other venture. It pretty much screams cool. There is one very long, very large table, some loud, colorful cartoon-like graphics on the walls, with black and white tiles beneath your feet. Lalo! is eclectic eggs dishes by day, pizza pies by night; what more could one want? RosettaRosetta is absolutely beautiful. The decor is warm and inviting and every room is riddled with strong personality. Here, inside of an old mansion house, we enjoyed an Italian influenced meal that while not perfect, was nonetheless quite memorable.The goat cheese carpaccio with truffles, drizzled honey and rye bread was a particular stand out!Panadaria RosettaBrought to you by the same chef as previously mentioned Rosetta, Panadaria Rosetta is a heavenly bakery in La Roma. Here you’ll find fresh breads, dozens of pastries, quiches that were among the best I’ve ever had and coffee from the nearby Cafe Cobalto.Grab a seat at bar, deliberate for a while and then settle in for an awesome experience. Worth a visit, for sure! ContramarContramar is excellent and was my favorite restaurant in Mexico City. We went early on a Friday afternoon to guarantee ourselves a seat. Contramar is absolutely a desired spot, both for locals and guests alike.Very quickly, our waiter Jose plus to large group of locals next to us seemed to be one big happy family, and sat for hours and hours full of food, drink and interesting conversation.The tuna tostadas are out of this world, and the massive grilled fish that comes doused in two different sauces is something you will never forget. If I could dine here weekly, I’d do so without hesitation. Make sure this one happens. El CardenalThis is a Mexico City institution. There are a few locations, but the one we were advised to go to by locals was the one nearest to downtown. El Cardenal fast moving, sprawling and bustling. You will likely have to wait, so be prepared to wander the nearby square as you do.Upon sitting, busy waiters will offer natas (clotted cream) and warm fresh bread, which you should definitely take advantage of.After that choose from a huge array of traditional Mexican dishes; the tacos de cameron with a side of guac and the enchiladas with chili, cheese, shredded lettuce and slices radishes were some of our favorites.CovadongaFor a good dose of what DF used to be, go here. The huge and rather elegant Covadonga is one of the few cantinas that has successfully turned traditional into trendy.The décor hasn’t changed that much, retaining the antique bar and square wooden tables from when it originated, but the clientele has transformed from domino-playing regulars to the young on a retro night out.The menu features nominally Spanish food, with tortilla Espanola and Jamon Serrano. The pulpo is a must order, too! Tacos GusTacos Gus is a hole in the wall spot with to die for, you guessed it, tacos. Pick your poison by choosing from a dozen meat or veggie fillers that the friendly man behind the counter will talk you through, and let him know if you want guacamole or potatoes on it, too.Your creation will be handed to you on a brightly colored plastic plate, with a plastic bag wrapped around it for easy repurposing, which seemed to be a running theme in this city. From there douse your tacos with salsas of your choosing, and grab a seat inside or on the street.Nothing easier, nothing better. Café AvellanedaCafe Avellaneda is another super cool coffee shop, in the Coyoacan area of DF. This is a very much the definition of a true hole in the wall (it’s a teeny tiny space on one of the winding side streets), but the coffee they crank out is no slack.If you order espresso it’ll be served to you on a fancy little tray complete with different strength drips, water and a mini cookie.READ NEXT: The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico Read MoreTop Ten Things to Do in Mexico’s Yucatan PeninsulaVisiting Punta de Mita & Sayulita, MexicoThe Ultimate Tulum Travel GuideShop Mexico City travel items!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){ var e, p; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js'; var cb = new Date().getTime(); p += '?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */"

The northeast coast of Quintana Roo is Riviera Maya, one of the most popular areas for visitors and where towns like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum are located.From the resort-stacked coastlines of Cancun to the bungalow-lined beaches of Tulum, there is something for everyone!Here are ten amazing things to do in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula! Swim with Whale Sharks in Isla HolboxOne of the most popular activities in the region is to take a trip to Isla Holbox, a narrow island just off the north coast of Cancun, which is an amazing natural paradise. Home to amazing marine life, whale sharks can regularly be spotted in the summer months, and there are several tours that offer you the chance to swim alongside the majestic animals.Plus the white-sand beaches and resort cabanas that line the coast are heaven, too! Read More:Traveling to Isla Holbox20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Isla Holbox Snorkel with Turtles in AkumalThe name of the town translates as the ‘place of the turtles,’ so it is no surprise to see there are plenty of turtles there. Bring your own snorkeling gear and you can swim with the turtles just off the beach for FREE. Otherwise, snorkeling gear and lockers are available for rent!Please be sure to either skip the sunscreen or wear only “Reef Safe” sunscreen to protect the marine life and reefs!    Practice Yoga in TulumA charming town that has a lovely beach and some interesting Mayan ruins on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, Tulum has developed a reputation for the range of health and wellness centers around the beach, which offer a variety of great spots to practice yoga.Read More:Where to Find the Best Food in TulumThe Ultimate Wellness Guide to Tulum, Mexico Discover the Yucatan’s CenotesThousands of these underwater rivers of freshwater can be found throughout this part of Mexico.

Scuba Dive in CozumelA short ferry trip from Cancun, the island of Cozumel is a wonderful natural location covered in forest, but the waters around the island are equally interesting. Cozumel is famous for the thriving population of fish and marine life that make the scuba diving here some of the best in the world. Read More:Scuba Diving in Cozumel with Scubatony10 Reasons to Scuba Dive on Your Next Trip Visit an Xcaret ParkDescribed as Eco-archeological parks, the Xcaret, Xel Ha and Xplor parks offer unique and all-inclusive experiences. Tube down a river, zip line, and snorkel, all within one of the three parks. There’s something for everyone, whether you’re looking for an adventure or an opportunity to get up close and personal with nature. Hang Out in Playa del CarmenThis coastal city has developed from its roots as a fishing village thanks to its stunning beach, while the range of restaurants and cafes make this a great place to take a time out and simply watch the rest of the people come and go. Visit Chichén ItzáDrawing over a million visitors per year, this complex of Mayan pyramids and platforms is a spectacular demonstration of the architectural achievements of the culture, and while you can no longer climb the pyramids, it is still a stunning place to visit and to appreciate the achievements of Mayan culture.    Party in CancunWhile Cancun may be at its liveliest during Spring Break, it’s not the best time of year to come. Avoid Spring Break and come to Cancun when the crowds have died down. There is always a party to be enjoyed in the city, with Coco Bongo being one of the main destinations in the city for those looking for good music and a late-night party. Get Away From it All in BacalarThis small and quiet city on the Yucatan Peninsula is most famous for the lagoon on the east side of the city, which has very clear water and is fed by cenotes in the surrounding area. Bacalar is a bit of a local’s secret and is a great place for some natural beauty and relaxation! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/scuba-diving-in-cozumel-with-scubatony/,Scuba Diving in Cozumel with Scubatony,Mexico,"Cozumel is a beautiful little island located off the coast of Playa Del Carmen and is well-known for its warm water, protected reefs, wall dives, and drift dives. With an array of sea life and a breathtaking reef system, it’s a scuba diver’s dream.While planning my trip to the Yucatan Peninsula, I knew I couldn’t miss an afternoon “unda da sea” in Cozumel!I discovered the ScubaTony Cozumel when searching for the best scuba center in Cozumel and planned my trip to the island from Playa del Carmen. It was a short ferry ride over to the beautiful island of Cozumel where I arrived at white sanded beaches and sky-high palm trees.I caught a cab to the dive center, hopped the Scubatony boat and we made our way out for our dive!I’ve dove around the world, including Bocas del Toro, the Komodo Islands, the Red Sea, and The Great Barrier Reef, but Cozumel was my first drift dive!  On my dive, I dropped below the surface into what felt like an underwater river. The current caught me and it gently led me through an underwater playground.The experience was absolutely incredible!On my two-tank dive, I encountered countless colorful fish, an Eagle ray, a HUGE Moray eel, and about 15 lobsters. It was so beautiful!I want to mention that from November to March, large bull shark females arrive in the Playa del Carmen and Cozumel in order to breed so that’s an awesome time to visit! The island of Cozumel is also great for a diving trip—it has good places to eat and drink, warm water, friendly locals, and white sandy beaches.If you’re planning on heading to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, don’t miss scuba diving in Cozumel with Scubatony! More InformationDive: 2-Tank DiveCompany: ScubaTony CozumelCost: $90 USDSpecial thanks to Scubatony for having me as a guest and introducing me to drift diving. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-solo-female-travelers-guide-to-the-yucatan-peninsula-in-mexico/,The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula,Mexico,"The Yucatan Peninsula is one of the most popular areas for those who are visiting Mexico and whether you are heading to one of the large resort cities such as Cancun in the Riviera Maya, or looking to get a little further off the beaten track, it is an attractive place to explore.When it comes to exploring the Yucatan Peninsula as a solo female traveler, it is a beautiful and safe place to visit!Is it Safe Alone?As someone born and raised just over an hour north of the Mexican border, the debate over safety when traveling to Mexico is ongoing. While travel safety in certain parts of Mexico is questionable, the Yucatan Peninsula is well-known as a safe and beautiful destination.After my recent trip to Cancun, I stayed an extra week to travel solo throughout the Yucatan Peninsula. I partied in Playa del Carmen, went scuba diving in Cozumel, swam with turtles in Akumal and even spent time in a sweat lodge in Tulum (but that’s for another story).I’ve also spent 3 nights on Isla Holbox!I stayed in both hotels and hostels, made some awesome new friends, ate incredible food, and not once did I encounter a situation that made me feel uncomfortable or question my safety. I traveled mostly by collectivo (a public bus used mostly by locals) and other solo female travelers along the way.Just like with any other destination you visit, use practical sense and follow your intuition. Don’t let generalizations about the safety of an entire country deter you from exploring this amazing region of Mexico!Stick to Popular DestinationsCancun is one of the most popular destinations in the Yucatan Peninsula and is famous for its beautiful beaches, wild nightlife and a wide range of all-inclusive resorts. While it is, without a doubt, a great place to visit don’t miss the rest of the Yucatan! For your safety, stick to traveling to popular destinations, such as:Isla Mujeres: This tiny island is located a short ferry ride off the coast of Cancun. Known for its beautiful beaches and pristine turquoise water, it’s the perfect day trip from Cancun.Isla Holbox: This island is most well known for being the best destination to swim with whale sharks. While the peak season for this once-in-a-lifetime experience is between July and August, it’s still an insanely beautiful island worth visiting any time of year.Playa del Carmen: Playa is my favorite destination in the Yucatan for a few reasons. You’ll find beautiful beaches, world-class dining, incredible “hole-in-the-wall” mom and pop shops, great shopping and plenty of nightlife. There’s something for every type of traveler!Cozumel: Known as one of the best dive spots in the world, Cozumel is a quick ferry ride from Playa del Carmen and an easy day trip. I highly recommend organizing a diving trip with Scuba Tony. I spent the day exploring the underwater world on a 2-tank dive and saw everything from lobster to eagle rays!Akumal: This gem is located between Playa del Carmen and Tulum and is one of the best places you could ever visit. Rent a life jacket and snorkel gear and simply walk from the shore into the ocean to come face to face with sea turtles, rays and fish!Tulum: Quickly becoming one of the hottest destinations of the Yucatan Peninsula, Tulum is a trendy retreat for wellness, yoga and eco-resorts. Don’t miss my Ultimate Tulum Travel Guide for all of my tips for planning your visit!Bacalar: This sleepy town is still a bit off the grid of the popular tourist path of the Yucatan, making it the best destination for getting away from the crowds. Expect to find sparkling white sand and beautiful beaches.Visit Popular Historic AttractionsProbably the most famous Mayan site on the peninsula is the pyramid at Chichen Itza, which is surrounded by a wonderful complex of other buildings. Tulum is another popular destination where a fairly small set of ruins occupy a stunning clifftop location with views over a wonderful beach.The Tulum ruins definitely don’t provide the same “WOW” factor as Chichen Itza, but are worth visiting.How to Get Around SafelyTransport around the Yucatan is generally quite safe, and most towns and cities will have bus services that connect the different areas. Look for ADO stations for longer journeys and trips to and from the airport.Most buses will store your luggage safely in compartments, but it is worth carrying any valuables with you if possible and to be wary of pickpockets.If you are traveling short distances, colectivos can be found in most towns and charge around 30 pesos ($2 USD) so they’re much cheaper than taking a taxi. Keep in mind, you won’t be able to travel with a lot of luggage, so pack light and prepare to squeeze in with the locals.Helpful Tip: Regardless of the sweltering temperatures outside, it is worth taking an extra layer of clothing for bus journeys, as the air conditioning is often turned up high.Drinking, Drug Use and TaxisIt goes without saying that you should stay well away from drugs in Mexico’s Riviera Maya. The ongoing trouble in other parts of the country mean that police may come down hard if they do find you in possession of drugs.It’s also a common scam for taxi drivers to offer passengers drugs then blackmail them, especially in Cancun.Common sense precautions like not getting too drunk or traveling late at night by yourself are as important here as they are when you are traveling anywhere else in the world. If you do have to go back to a hotel at night, make sure you get an official taxi.In many areas, some unofficial taxis may have rigged meters that lead to a huge charge. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/worst-airline-experience/,"Houston, We Have a Problem…",Mexico,"Last week, I decided to take a spontaneous trip. Nothing too shocking, right? Cabo san Lucas, Mexico is a short 2-hour flight from Los Angeles and is likely the most popular international destination for So-Cal locals. Flights are cheap and the margaritas can’t be beat. When my friend asked if I wanted to join her on a quick two-night girls trip to Cabo…I didn’t need much convincing.What was (in theory) one of the easiest international trips I could have possibly taken turned into the worst airline experience I’ve had to date. With over 35 countries and countless flights under my belt, that’s saying something.My two girlfriends and I arrived at LAX over two hours prior to our flight to Cabo. We were flying with… United Airlines. Some of you reading this probably just shuddered when you read that. Why did we even take a chance? I can explain. We booked the night before and it was literally the only flight to Cabo the following day.WILL TAKE CHANCES FOR TEQUILAWe checked in at the digital kiosk and realized we didn’t have seat assignments. I thought to myself, “That’s weird.” An attendant reassured us that the oddity was nothing to be worried about and that an attendant at our boarding gate would assign us our seats. Hmm. Ok. Still weird.Upon arriving at the gate, we realized our flight was then delayed an hour. An hour of sunshine missed on a 48 hour trip is seriously upsetting, but we accepted the annoyance and waited for United staff to come to the gate.After nearly TWO HOURS of waiting at the gate, an attendant finally arrived.Said attendant was quite a “peach” for lack of a better term. We addressed the seat situation and the attendant, who I shall refer to as Slick Sally, responded with a forced Pleasantville smile, “If you could just have a seat until boarding. We’ll be right with you.”Another “that’s weird” moment.Shortly after returning to our seats, Slick Sally called for priority passenger boarding. Then Group 1, Group 2 and so on. After every other passenger was standing in the boarding line, another attendant, who I shall refer to as Dick (short for Richard of course), joined Slick Sally and asked for three volunteers to take the next flight to Cabo in exchange for a $300 United flight voucher. I looked to my two girlfriends and counted 1, 2, 3. No… it can’t be. I started to panic. WTF is going on?!I marched up to Dick and Slick Sally demanding an explanation. Dick greeted me with the same forced smile. Before I could even get a word out he responded, “If you could just have a seat. We’ll be right with you.” Holy ROBOT. My stomach dropped. I couldn’t believe what was happening! The staff was completely rehearsed on “not” dealing with their customers.The speakers came on again, “We are looking for three volunteers… blah blah blah.”Nobody was stepping out of line. I read right through the situation. United overbooked the flight to Cabo. Mind you, we were flying out on a Wednesday morning with Friday being Valentine’s Day and Monday being a national holiday. Nobody was going to give up their seat for a $300 flight voucher.I accepted our fate well before United admitted their fault.I refused to return to my seat and waited at the desk for Dick and Slick Sally to acknowledge me and explain what was really going on. They wouldn’t even look at me and continued boarding each and every other passenger. Dick and Slick Sally were then joined by Silent Stan who also failed to acknowledge my existence.Once every passenger had boarded the plane, and the empty boarding gate was completely void of a pulse (with exception to us three ladies), we were gifted eye contact and three forced smiles. Dick confidently rehearsed his script, “I have some good news and some bad news. Good news is we are going to get you on the next flight out of LA to Cabo. Bad news is you’ll have to wait another 4 hours until your flight to Houston where you’ll stay the night and then fly to Cabo tomorrow morning.”Oh. Is that all?We were now looking at a 28-hour travel day (instead of a 2-hour direct flight) to then spend less than 24 hours in Cabo. Could you point out the good news again, Dick? Thanks.To “ease us” of our burdens we were offered a flight voucher, a hotel for the night in Houston and a $7 meal voucher. I laughed out loud. (Yes. I really LOL’d.) “Thanks for covering my coffee, Dick.” I was clearly annoyed and felt that United had no interest in truly making up for what a huge inconvenience they had created. Sure, our accommodation was taken care of, but what if we had a non-refundable hotel room in Cabo that night? United wouldn’t have reimbursed us.Despite the serious compromise we were making on getting to Cabo, the girls and I agreed we would be willing to still go, be redirected to Houston, spend the night, etc., etc.WILL DO DESPERATE THINGS FOR TEQUILABefore agreeing, I had further requests. I confidently stated, “We need to be upgraded to first-class on all the flights and be given lounge access on our layovers.” Dick then LOL’d. “We can’t go handing out lounge access to just anyone. If we did that for everyone who complained, well, it just wouldn’t be exclusive anymore. Now would it?” Oh how silly a peasant am I to request something so beyond my petty flight class… on my FOUR HOUR LAYOVER that you just put me on.Excuse me while I fume…My friend, in an attempt to cool down the situation, jokingly responded, “This will be fine. Just throw in a Xanax for each of us and we’ll take the next flight.” I’ll admit she got a chuckle out of me. Then something happened that I still cannot fully comprehend. Dick reaches into his pocket, pulls out a large prescription pill and says, “I’ll split it with ya” and follows his remark with a creepy wink.I nearly fainted.Did that really just happen?! I wish the story ended there. With Dick’s supervisor (whom witnessed the entire incident with wide eyes and mouth agape) confiscating the pill and reprimanding him. Instead, she said nothing. Did nothing. And we were left to wait four hours for our flight to Houston.The fun didn’t stop there either. We were awarded another delayed flight to Houston and a 1-star (which is a stretch) hotel stay. And guess what?! Our flight home from Cabo?! Also delayed. United, I’m not even mad. I’m impressed. You officially are the WORST airline I have ever flown with. Congratulations!You make Ryanair look like first-class on Emirates.While I realize this article is emotionally charged, all of the statements I have made are entirely true. I left out employee names because, at the end of the day, I’m not trying to get anyone fired. Customer Service is a difficult job and, for all I know, Dick could be a nice guy and could have been offering me a Women’s One-a-Day multi-vitamin.The fault falls not on Dick nor Slick Sally, but United.I actually tweeted to United while we waited on our layover at LAX, whom responded,Would you be surprised knowing that I never heard back?I hope this article gets their attention. United Airlines, get it together. This is not how you treat paying customers.For the 2-3 people who read this and think, “I’ve always had great experiences flying United.” I also realize that not every United flight gets overbooked and that you can’t judge an entire company, airline or country off a single travel experience. I’m a firm believer in second chances in travel. But, I can confidently say that I have never received such horrible customer service nor so many delays by any other airline in all my travels.Still don’t believe me?“United had the highest rate among its peers of involuntarily bumping ticketed passengers from flights.”-The Wall Street Journal, 2013“United Airlines ranked #1 Worst Airline of 2013 in America” –U.S. News Travel, 2013“Here’s Why United Was Just Named America’s Worst Airline” –DailyFinance, 2013Have you also had a bad experience with United Airlines?Share your story below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/homemade-tamales/,Homemade Tamales,Mexico,"This is a guest post by Amy Pamensky, Nutritionist, Natural Chef and founder of Nourished Balance. She is one of my favorite food bloggers and it’s an honor to have her share her recipe for one of my favorite holiday foods!What are you making for the holidays?! This week I got together with my friend Kiersten from The Blonde Abroad to make some homemade tamales. We had so much fun wrapping the tamales together- it felt like we were wrapping little delicious gifts to give to family and friends for the holidays.We used a traditional tamale recipe however, being the Natural Food Chef and Nutritionist that I am, I decided to make a few key changes to the recipe to make a healthier version.[youtube id=”xabW-8-bU_4″ width=”70%” height=”40%”]A lot of tamale recipes call for a TON of butter. I am not opposed to using organic butter (I believe in healthy fats!) however I think that 1 1/2 sticks or 6 ounces of butter is a little excessive.Traditional recipes also call for around 1/4 cup of white sugar. I prefer to use natural sweeteners when possible. In this recipe, I chose to use sweet corn and, trust me, the recipe was plenty sweet enough without adding sugar. “I don’t understand why the other homemade tamale recipes add so much sugar or butter- these are delicious without them!”-Kiersten, The Blonde AbroadUnfortunately most of the corn in the U.S. is Genetically Modified (G.M.O.). That is why I chose to use organic, non-GMO corn and corn meal instead of conventional corn.And last, but not least, I always choose organic animal products. So we used organic eggs and butter in this recipe.Okay, that’s enough of the nutrition talk…Let’s get to the RECIPE!Ingredients1 bag corn husks (hojas)- can find these in the ethnic section of the grocery store1 bag organic sweet corn (look for non-gmo)3 cups water3 cups masa harina (flour)- or organic corn meal (look for non-gmo)Juice of ½ lime1 tsp sea salt¼ tsp pepper¼ tsp cumin1 organic egg2 Tbsp organic butter, melted¼ yellow onion2 cloves garlicOptional Fillings:Manchego cheeseRoasted red peppersShredded chickenShredded beefDirectionsSoak corn husks in warm water for at least 30 minutes. Note: You will need to place a bowl on top of the corn husks to keep them submerged in water.Add the remaining ingredients to food processor to make your masa de maiz (corn dough)Rinse and dry corn husksPlace 1 corn husk in the palm of your hand. Place 1/3 cup masa in the centerAdd desired fillings: roasted red peppers, black beans, chili sauce, olives, shredded chicken, spinach, cheese, etc.Top with more masaFold the bottom of the corn husk up, then roll the tamale and tie with a piece of corn huskAdd about 3 inches of water to the bottom of a big pot. Place steamer basket in the pot. Turn up the heat until water is boiling, reduce heat to a low/medium heat. Add the tamales, cover and steam for 30-40 minutes, or until mixture is firm. Check every 10 minutes or so and add water as needed.Makes 1 dozenAmy Pamensky is the founder of Nourished Balance.

https://theblondeabroad.com/puerto-vallarta-stays-puerto-vallarta/,What Happens in Puerto Vallarta…,Mexico,"While me and two of my girlfriends were on a getaway in Punta de Mita, Mexico, we decided to take the 45 minute trip into Puerto Vallarta for a day trip. We had no idea that the day would lead to a bikini photo shoot, a “Real Enchilada” of a zip-line tour, an intimate encounter with Marmosets or a near-death experience with a Burmese Python.1, 2, 3… AND we’re having SO MUCH FUN!Our day started off with a stop at the Villa del Palmar Flamingos Resort for poolside cocktails. The three of us were sipping on our tropical blends of frozen strawberry and pineapple deliciousness when a photo crew frantically came up to us with an inquiry. The resort was shooting photos for their in-room televisions and were wondering if we would volunteer our bikini clad bodies in exchange for a day tour of our choice. The three of us exchanged a laugh and decided, “Why not?”I can imagine this one has sold them some suitesThe photo shoot went on innocently enough with plenty of big fake smiles, lots of splashing around in the pool and the three of us merrily skipping down the sandy beach hand in hand. As cheesy as it was, we ended up having a ton of fun and scored some professional BFF pics. Plus, how often does something like that happen?! Never. (Update: We have received reports, more than a few times, by unsuspecting friends that our pictures are still circulating around the resort. How embarrassing!)So hot. Literally. We were sweating.In exchange for our photos we got to choose between a handful activities and we decided on a zip-line tour with Los Veranos Canopy Tours. The tour company picked us up and we drove along the coastline and high up into the rainforest. Once we arrived at the tour center, we equipped ourselves with fluorescent yellow helmets, not-so-fresh gloves, and utility belts. It felt more like we were ready for a day on a construction site than an adventure tour. We got a quick briefing and then it was the Three Amigas vs. The Zip Line!Zippin!The tour guides were HILARIOUS and had us cracking up the entire time. They referred to the act of hooking ourselves on the cable, by lifting one leg up and jumping to suspend ourselves, as “The Sexy Leg.” You could say it was anything but sexy. For about four hours we went speeding through the rainforest on over 2 miles of cables! The longest cable, called “The Real Enchilada” was over 1100 ft long! Our amazing guides had something special planned for us on the last cable… we were hooked up to the cable UPSIDE DOWN. I could hardly think over my own screaming as I flew across the Orquideas River hanging from a simple cable harness.How do you say, “Not my cup of tea,” in Spanish?Our adrenaline was raging after we finished the tour so we grabbed a shot at the Tequila Bar at Los Veranos base camp. After we calmed our nerves we were directed to a really cool surprise. A small Animal Sanctuary at Los Veranos is home to a family of Marmosets and tons of creepy crawlers. I skipped having an African Cave-Dwelling Spider crawl on my face. Maybe you’ve seen one on Fear Factor or in Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire? The massive scorpion-like spiders with wirey-legs and claws like lobsters? Ya. No thanks.Is there something in my eye?On a happier note, the Marmosets might be the coolest little critters I’ve ever met. They are incredibly friendly and had no problem getting up close and personal. They remind me of a cross between an Ewok and a Gremlin. Incredibly cute! We were wrapping up our visit when one of the animal handlers came over with a GIANT Burmese Python. Unlike spiders, I have no problem with snakes. My friends on the other hand were not as excited to get cozy with the serpent.This one’s going above the fireplaceMy friends agreed to take a picture with the Python as long as we did it together. After the awkward family photo, I convinced them to get solo shots with our new friend. I don’t really know what happened, or if the Python did get a little excited, but my friend got a tighter hug than expected. She may or may not have freaked out a little bit. Just a little bit.Clearly overreacting. He just wanted a hug!So needless to say, our day ended up to be one of the craziest days of our entire trip down to Mexico!

https://theblondeabroad.com/cabo-san-lucas-mexico/,Cabo San Lucas Travel Tips,Mexico,"While I typically write on more cultural experiences abroad we all deserve a “vacation” once in a while. Mexico is definitely a cultural destination, but for many people, it’s a popular vacation destination. Inexpensive flights, luxurious resorts and adventurous activities are just a few reasons to visit the sun soaked coast of Mexico! One of my favorite spots in Mexico for a little R&R is Cabo San Lucas.El Arco, Cabo San LucasCabo is famous for its beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife, delicious food and countless adventure activities! A return flight out of Southern California can cost less than $300 and resorts are always giving great deals on stays. Timeshares are also very popular in Cabo and, although I’ve never rented through a timeshare, I know you can find rentals on tons of websites at low prices. A vacation in Cabo can be anything you make of it! Whether you’re looking for an all-inclusive resort getaway or a fun-filled nightlife experience, Cabo has it all!Resorts in Cabo San LucasThe coastline is lined with luxurious resorts complete with infinity edge pools and five star day spas. You literally never have to leave the resort if you don’t want to! I typically never travel fancy but if you can round up a group of friends, travel with your family or plan a romantic getaway, it cuts cost down dramatically. It’s also possible to rent a car and stay just outside of the main area in Cabo. We went to the local Costco and stocked up on snacks and cocktail necessities to save a few bucks. You get a taste of the good life without breaking the bank.Stunning view from the Sheratan Hacienda del MarNightlife in Cabo San LucasAside from the beautiful resorts and their amenities, the central area in Cabo is lined with famous bars and restaurants. Some of the most famous bars are The Giggling Marlin, El Squid Row, The Nowhere Bar and Cabo Wabo. You’re sure to have an awesome time and might even get groped by one of the cocktail waitresses as they come by with Jello shots. If you’re looking for more of a club scene or lounge than a bar, check out Passion Club & Lounge or Pink Kitty.Cabo Wabo!Activities in Cabo San LucasThere is a ton of stuff to do in Cabo for all ages! There is world class golfing, sport fishing, ATV tours, Sea-Doo rentals, surfing, horseback riding and parasailing to name a few! You can organize trips and activities online, at your hotel or hit up a tour company on the beach. We scored a package that included parasailing from the back of a speedboat, a catamaran trip with snorkeling and an ATV tour that took us to a beautiful private beach.Gone fishin’!Strap yourself to a parasail!Snorkel the crystal clear coastline!Take an ATV tour to the beach!Other Things to KnowWhile there are many places in Mexico that are unsafe for travel, popular travel destinations like Cabo, Puerto Vallarta and Cancun remain fun and friendly destinations.The sun is HOT! Do not think that because you don’t burn you won’t in Cabo. My friend got a gnarly heat rash our first day at the pool and ended up spending the night covered in oatmeal to soothe the pain. Layer on that sun cream and stay hydrated!There is room to haggle with tours and souvenirs, but that’s about it. Be street smart about what goods and services should cost because on occasion you may be getting the “gringo” price. Don’t try and negotiate your dinner bill but also be wary of an obvious rip-off.You will most likely see iguanas. No they are not dinosaurs and no they will not eat you.Heat rash happens… Don’t fall victim!An iguana working on his tan at the resort poolRead Next: Tips for Traveling Mexico in the Summer"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-go-on-safari-in-africa/,The Best Time to Go on Safari in Africa by Month,Mozambique,"Since moving to South Africa, going on safari has become one of my favorite things to do. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, the continent has such raw, natural beauty. And Africa has way more diversity than you might think!Far from a one size fits all experience, you can choose the best safari experience in Africa for you and your travel style.I’ve been lucky enough to explore the African bush a few times and experience some of the best safari destinations in Africa. I absolutely adore interacting nature this way and seeing animals in their natural habitats.Of course, if you’re a shutterbug like yours truly, an African safari is a must. You’ll be traveling through some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. African safari photography will take your snaps to the next level.Before you go, check out some of my essential reads for everything you need to know before your first African safari. I’m talking crucial info like how to budget for an African safari and what to pack for a safari.Curious as to when the best time to go on safari is? Because there are so many places to choose from and seasonal differences, I’m breaking it down by month!   Where to Go + WhyPeople often ask me about the best time to go on safari and the top places to check out. The truth is that it totally depends—an African safari is highly seasonal and location dependent.The time of year impacts migration, how wet or dry the land is, and ultimately which animals you are going to see (which is a HUGE factor).The easiest way to decide where to go on safari is to figure out when you’re going. Once you know which month you want to visit Africa, you can start researching where to go on safari.So, animal lovers, here are the best times to go on safari in Africa, based on the month!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari  JanuaryThis is the heart of the rainy season in many of the top safari hotspots—which is not necessarily a bad thing! Rain provides a lush green landscape and there are a few detours you can take to get to dry land.UgandaJanuary is actually the dry season in Uganda so the days are typically warm and sunny, though you’ll want to pack a raincoat for visits around the Volcanoes National Park. It’s prime time for gorilla trekking, which makes this one of the best times to visit Uganda, in my opinion.KenyaIt’s also the dry season in Kenya, which means that the bush and grass are all quite short. This is an advantage in seeing local wildlife. Maasai Mara is one of the most beautiful places in Africa and this is one of the best times to see it.South AfricaIt is the wet season in South Africa so pack a raincoat. Animals are on the move so you will need to be strategic to find them. Explore Sabi Sands near the Mozambique border or head down to Cape Town. Kruger National Park is an amazing safari park right outside of the city.This is especially great for a first safari because you can explore the bright lights of the big town, then simply hop in the car to go for a day trip to Kruger National Park. The animal sightings are just as impressive but there’s less need to rough it or pay for a pricey lodge out in the countryside.TanzaniaJanuary is the end of the rainy season and it is one of the premier months for spotting migrating wildebeest, zebra, and gnu, especially near the southern Ndutu and Salei plains.  UgandaFebruaryLike January, you will run into some rainy spots while exploring much of Africa in February. It is the best time of year to go on a safari though if you are interested in seeing baby animals (and who isn’t?)!South AfricaFebruary is a warm but rainy summer month in South Africa. The beloved Garden Route that runs from Mossel Bay in the west to Storms River in the east is lush and green. Make a stop in Knysna for a perfect base to explore. Make your way up to Kruger National Park to see the Big 5, or come down to Cape Town for an urban wonderland.KenyaBaby animals! Need I say more?For your very own cuteness overload, February is the time to visit Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda to see adorable little guys of all shapes and sizes. February is also good because it is a hot and dry time that will bring out big game and birds in places like Maasai Mara and Laikipia. Safaris will take you to the animals’ fave water spots where they love to hang out. Keep an eye out for wild cats too during this time!TanzaniaWhile the southern part of the country is too hot and humid for me, I love northern Tanzania during February. Almost half a million wildebeest are born in this single month in Tanzania! You will find cheetahs all over the Serengeti while you ooh and ahh at all the little babies. Best of all, the rain passes by Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya during February so it’s prime time for a visit here.Uganda and RwandaThe warm and dry weather makes perfect gorilla trekking conditions! Just be aware that the later you go in February, the more likely you are to run into rain, especially near Volcanoes National Park.Helpful Tip:While I’d recommend seeing as much of Africa as you can during your trip, this isn’t the time to visit Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Namibia if you’re interested in seeing big game. These areas are pretty quiet in February.  MarchFrankly, March isn’t the best time of year for a safari in the majority of Africa. That said, if March is your only available time, there are definitely a couple of places where you can make it work.TanzaniaThe rainy reason is just starting and migration is at its peak. I would highly recommend checking out the Serengeti during the famous Great Migration. It’s also a chance to see the little newborn wildebeests discovering their new world right alongside you.South AfricaThe weather is still good in South Africa in March and it’s a dream season to drive along the renowned Garden Route. It is also a perfect time to visit Kruger and Sabi Sands, though you’ll want to avoid areas close to Botswana and Zambia as they’re both pretty likely to be rained out.  RIVER CRUISE AT MENO A KWENA, BotswanaAprilApril showers bring May…tigers! The continent is washed over in April. Vegetation is ultra lush, which is beautiful but makes it harder to see the animals.Since water is plentiful, animals don’t need to congregate in any particular watering hole because water is all over. This can make animals hard to see in many countries. There are a few key spots that are at their best in April though.BotswanaWith the rivers full to the brim, this is the perfect time to explore the Okavango Delta and visit Victoria Falls. Located between Zimbabwe and Zambia, a trip to Victoria Falls is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Africa. While it’s not peak season for a game viewing safari, this is the best time to visit Botswana if you’re looking to save a bit of cash.Botswana is actually one of the most expensive safari destinations, so traveling outside of peak season can be a major perk for your wallet. Best of all, you can see the incredible raw beauty of the Okavango Delta flooded (a bucket list item for any safari lover!).NamibiaThe wet season is ending in April and Namibia is once against bathed in sun. If you are ready for the ultimate road trip, add a drive across Namibia to your things to do in Africa list.South AfricaWelcome to autumn in South Africa! As cooler and drier weather comes, trees lose their leaves and it’s easy to spot the local wildlife. Local game reserves are a perfect destination.TanzaniaIn April, I would highly recommend checking out the northern parks of Tanzania. It is a top time to go on a safari and you will be able to avoid peak season, which runs from July to October.  MayJust as things are warming up in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a chill in the air south of the equator. When it comes to the best time to go on safari, this simply isn’t prime time for most of Africa—with one spectacular exception though!MozambiqueJust before the peak season, Mozambique is at its best. The afternoons get into the high 80s while the afternoons rarely fall below 50 degrees. The skies are clearing up as the rainy season ends. Hotspots like Gorognosa and Niassa are prime for exploration.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Mozambique   Namibia JuneJune is the turning point of the year in Africa. Goodbye, rain. Hello, sunshine! June is one of the best times of year to go on safari in Africa in so many diverse spots around the continent.South AfricaIn South Africa, you’ll find two distinctly different seasons in June. In the northern part of the country, things are drying out. It’s peak game viewing time up there and the days are sunny. In the south, near Cape Town, however, it’s the absolute rainiest time of the year.While it’s not great for a safari, it is the best time of year to see the whale migration in the Southern Cape. Explore the delta as herds head to Chobe and then make their way over to Linyanti.NamibiaThe weather is dry and relatively warm. As the natural sources of water are diminished by the arid season, it is easy to spot animals hanging out together at local water sources. Be sure to plan ample time to explore Etosha National Park.ZimbabweThe peak season here is from June to September. During June, the landscape is drying out. You know by now that dry weather means animals partying at the local watering hole! June is also a dream month to visit Victoria Falls (and I’d highly recommend flying over to see the falls while they’re at their most powerful of the year).  OKAVANGO RIVER CRUISEJulyDry season is in full swing and you will be spoilt for choice all around the continent. This is peak travel time and easily the best time of year for a safari in the majority of the best spots in Africa.It’s nearly impossible to choose the best place to go in July—but you better hurry!This is the most popular time of year and things sell out fast. Of course, that means that trips come at a premium so your options for a budget safari are pretty limited.TanzaniaSerengeti National Park is a massive draw during July. The Great Migration in northern Serengeti will truly blow your mind. Elephants are migrating in Tarangire while spots like Katavi, Selous, and Ruaha offer something a bit more off the beaten path.South AfricaMore of the same from June, the weather in the north of South Africa is getting even drier and spotting wildlife is getting even easier. Meanwhile, the Cape is still rained out but with perfect whale spotting conditions.BotswanaJuly is definitely one of the best times of year to visit Botswana. Famous areas like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and Linyanti are flawless. The Delta is gloriously flooded and animal spotting is as likely as ever. Just note that animals have mostly left the Pans and Kalahari area.KenyaThe Great Migration is running its way through Maasai Mara during July and August. We are talking wildebeest and zebra galore! It is an amazing time but definitely busy. Take your time and do some research while picking a camp so you don’t end up anywhere too crowded when safari madness sweeps the world.  Kenya Ultimate GuideAugustAnother unbeatable time of year for an African safari! The weather is still dry for a bit longer and ideal across the continent in many spots.KenyaYou haven’t missed the Great Migration yet so get to Maasai Mara to see a draw-dropping movement of wildebeests and zebras. Be sure to spend at least part of your safari at the river where you can see these guys zigzagging between crocodiles as they make their way across the river.TanzaniaYou can also check out dramatic river crossing in Tanzania, especially in Lamai and Kogatende. Iconic spots like the Serengeti National Park are at their best as the elephant migration takes over the country (around in Tarangire). While tourism is at its peak, you can still check to find tranquil spots around Selous, Ruaha, and Katavi.BotswanaIf you want to see majestic elephants, look no further.The Chobe and Linyanti area has more of these massive cuties than anywhere else on the continent. The Okavango Delta is still flooded as well and looks incredible at this time of year. Just note that the Pans and the Kalahari are largely empty at this time of year as the local wildlife vacations abroad.ZimbabweAlso in its peak season, Zimbabwe is at the top of its game for safaris. Adventure lovers will want to make sure to hop over to Victoria Falls after the game spotting for more heart-stopping fun. The water is a bit lower at this time of year and it’s white water rafting season.NamibiaFor more unforgettable animal sightings, get to Etosha then make your way out to the Skeleton Coast to soak in the otherworldly beauty. Just LOOK at my latest pics and you won’t be able to wait another minute to see this epic country.  KenyaSeptemberGo big or go home in September! During the heart of the dry season, you are going to see the biggest of big game animals at top spots around the continent.TanzaniaDuring the Great Migration, Tanzania is at its peak with constant river crossings and elephants thundering through. Of course, the Serengeti National Park is an essential destination. For river crossings, the northern part of the park around Lamai and Kogatende is the place to be. To get up close and personal with the majestic elephants of Tanzania, be sure to plan time for Tarangire National Park.BotswanaSeptember is the best time to visit Botswana. Famous spots like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and the Linyanti are truly at their very best. Chobe and Linyanti is the elephant capital of Africa for the time. Meanwhile, the Okavango Delta is flooded and sparkling with beauty. While the whole country is beautiful, steer clear of the Pans and Kalahari areas, which many of the animals have left behind for the season.ZimbabweDry season is upon Zimbabwe and the conditions in the country couldn’t be better. After most of the tourists have gone home, all of the animals are gathering at their watering holes, and the country is ripe for exploration.NamibiaGet to Etosha peaks for unbeatable game viewing then make your way over to the Skeleton Coast for some of the most gorgeous scenery in all of Africa.MozambiqueTourists are clearing out as summer comes to an end (but the weather is still gorgeous!) in Mozambique. If you are looking to squeeze in a beach break during your African safari, look no further than this coastal retreat.KenyaOf course, it’s all about the Great Migration in Maasai Mara. This is one of the best times to visit Kenya. When you want to get away from the tourist hotspots, check out the quieter regions of the north. Game viewing is equally impressive up there but you’ll be a bit more off the beaten path.OctoberThe dry season is coming to an end in October but you can still find prime conditions across the country before the rain really starts to roll in.ZimbabweThe bush is still quite dry around Zimbabwe so animals are chilling around the most popular water sources. While the weather is still quite hot, it’s bearable. Be sure to plan time for Ruaha and Katavi where the tourists have cleared out and big game have taken their place. In the north, the Tarangire area is filled with elephants while the Serengeti is seeing many river crossings.KenyaPrices are lower than usual while the game is still active and visible. If you are looking for a budget safari option that will knock your hiking boots off, this one’s for you.TanzaniaStill in its peak season, it is warm but not crazy hot in Tanzania. To escape the heat of places like Zimbabwe, wildlife is coming to the permanent watering hole they know and love in Tanzania.  MEERKAT SAFARI IN BOTSWANANovemberThe southern side of Africa is into the rainy season. Humidity and heat (don’t forget it’s summer down here!) make it pretty uncomfortable in a lot of places. There is a minor East African migration for serious safari-goers in Liuwa Plain National Park but, otherwise, many of the popular spots are a washout.TanzaniaIf you stick to the northern part, you will see migrating herds making their way across the country despite the weather.BotswanaWhile it is not your traditional African safari fare, the skies above Botswana are alive with action. Birds are migrating through the Okavango Delta while dramatic storms sweep in for stunning photo ops.Although the weather is hot, it is at least a dry heat with the exception of passing storms. Since it’s not peak season, you can grab a major deal on when camps are offering up to 40 percent off their peak rates.DecemberWant to decorate the yuletide bush and ring in the new year under the stars? East Africa is the best place to be for a winter break in Africa. Across the regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the weather is dry and the animals are active.KenyaThe rainy season in Kenya is coming to an end in the middle of December. The scenery is lush and emerald but that makes it a bit tougher to spot game. It’s still worth it though! The Maasai Mara, Laikipia, and Lewa areas are drop-dead gorgeous at the end of the year.TanzaniaThe Serengeti and Ngorongoro area beautiful at this time of year but across the country rainfall will be making it a bit harder to spot game. Stick to the Northern Circuit to see the locals celebrating Christmas in their own way.OverallSo, my fellow explorers, that is all you need to create your perfect safari. I know there are a TON of options. Every month offers something a bit different.The bottom line is: just go! Africa, as a whole, is certainly one of the most underrated travel destinations on the planet. My best advice is to simply find a place that intrigues you and go for it.For me, the most dynamic and interesting countries in Africa for a safari are Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and, of course, my adopted home of South Africa.Note, while there are other places I could have included on this list, I mainly stuck to the ones with my opinion of “best experiences.”But I’d love to hear your opinions and what places you would suggest during certain times of the year below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-travel-to-mozambique/,The Best Time to Travel to Mozambique,Mozambique,"Located between South Africa and Tanzania, Mozambique is often overlooked by travelers. Many people choose to visit the more developed surrounding areas, however, it is home to one of the longest coastlines in the world, complete with some of the best beaches.And with those incredible beaches comes incredible seafood!Because of its location, Mozambique experiences a tropical climate meaning it has two distinct seasons: a wet season and a dry season. Planning a trip around this weather may seem a bit overwhelming which is why I’ve put together this guide to help you decide on just the right time to visit Mozambique!Here are the best times to travel to Mozambique!March to MayThe months of March to May are some of the best to visit Mozambique.It’s the tail end of the wet season meaning although you might face a few wet days, you’ll also be met with extremely moderate temps. With highs averaging in the mid-’80s, traveling during this time means you’ll avoid the influx of travelers and you’ll feel as if you have the whole island to yourself.With fewer crowds, you’ll find lower rates on flights and accommodation.May is also a big month for events. The two biggest being the AZGO Festival and STRAB. The AZGO Festival is a 3-day outdoor festival in Maputo where you’ll be able to experience live music, workshops, music documentaries playing, and markets (both food and craft) to wander around. STRAB is the Subterranean Rhythm & Blues Festival which features 20 live bands.  June to NovemberJune to November is arguably the best time to visit Mozambique (and the busiest). The dry season and winter begin in late May but don’t let the term winter scare you off.Because of its tropical climate, the air and water temperatures are incredibly warm.This is when you’ll find locals and tourists alike participating in lots of outdoor activities. From game viewing to diving and snorkeling to fishing—if you head to the southern coastline, you also might be able to do some whale watching, too!If you’re like me and you love scuba diving, Pemba, Nacala Bay, and Morrungulo offer some of the best diving on the island. If you would rather take advantage of the waves for surfing, plan your trip in June, July, or August. And make sure to include Ponto do Ouro, Barra Beach, and Guinjala Bay in your itinerary.Find my review of diving at Anantara Bazaruto Island Resort in Mozambique here!If you’re less of a beach person and you want to spend your time game viewing, visit in August or September. You’ll be able to spot animals in their natural habitat at the Gorongosa National Park.Because this is peak season, flights and accommodation can cost you up to 10% more than during the off-peak season. I highly recommend booking everything months in advance to get the best deals.Despite the higher prices, some of the best events take place during these months!In June, celebrate Independence Day in Maputo. You can enjoy dancing and music at the national stadium. In July, celebrate Mozamboogy, a festival focusing on music and colorful light displays. If you’re an adventurer, you can try your hand at slackline walking during the festival too. In August, join the party at the CHOPI Music Festival. It celebrates the musical heritage of the region.   December to FebruaryDecember to February are the island’s wettest months. The amount of rainfall you’ll experience depends on where on the island you’ll be staying. The rainfall is much heavier on the coast in comparison to the north and south. In these areas, you can expect plenty of humidity and thunderstorms.Come January, Mozambique’s cyclone season begins. If they do hit the island, it’s likely it will hit the south. Because of this January and February are best avoided. If you’re looking to stay on the northern side and you don’t mind rainfall, you will save money on hotels and accommodation. Are you thinking about a trip to Mozambique or have you already been?

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-going-on-an-african-safari/,The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari,Namibia,"One of the best things about living in Cape Town is having the opportunity to explore the depths of Africa. Even after being based here for years, I still jump at the chance to explore the great outdoors. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, there is nothing more captivating than experiencing exotic wildlife in their natural habitat.As completely worthwhile as it is, planning an African safari is a massive undertaking.Where is the best place to go? When is the prime time to spot animals? What should I pack for a safari? You guys have been asking me tons of questions about safaris and I’m ready to cover ‘em all!Ready to get wild? Here is your ultimate guide to going on an African safari.    The Best  Time to Go on SafariImagine the United States, China, India, and most of Europe combined together into one whopping mass of land. That incredible supercontinent will give you an idea of how big Africa is! In fact, Africa is four times larger than the continental US.Of course, if someone asks the best time to visit the US, it would depend on countless factors. The same is true of Africa. This diverse continent has snowy mountains, vast deserts, lush grasslands, and dense forests.You can have a completely different experience at different times of the year.The great thing about the sheer size of Africa is that you can visit any time of the year. Check out my post on the best time to go on safari in Africa for a full month-by-month guide to help you figure out where to go and when.What to Pack for a SafariTypically when it comes to packing, less is more. After all, you can almost always just pop down to the local shopping center and grab whatever you need. It’s a whole different story when you are on safari, however.More of than not, you’ll have no local amenities.When you’re out on a safari, you’re fully exposed to the elements and it’s crucial to have everything that you need for the day. On top of that, luggage space is often strictly limited (if you’re taking short bush flights to get to your destination), so you need to be highly strategic.Before you go, review my breakdown on what to pack for every type of safari so you are looking and feeling fab for every unforgettable second.  How to Find a Safari LodgeFinding the right safari lodge is crucial to the success of your trip! Unlike hotels where you come and go as you like, a safari lodge is typically where you spend much of your time.In most cases, they also provide the game drive itself.It’s totally possible to come all the way to Africa and, for better or worse, only interact with your lodge. Lodges tend to encompass a huge space and offer a lot. Before you commit, do diligent research.The first step to finding the right accommodation for a safari is to choose your safari experience. From tiny tents to luxe lodges, there is something for every type of traveler.One of your early steps is deciding which kind of safari-goer you are.When you know what experience you’re after, carefully review these critical things to look for in a safari lodge.Last but certainly not least, think about the experience from the side of the animals. Safaris are about safely entering animals’ habitat without affecting a thing. Before you decide on a safari company, look for key tips on how to have an ethical animal encounter. Sadly, too many companies are focused on profit over animal welfare.Plan carefully for a cruelty-free adventure.

How Much to Budget for SafariSafaris aren’t cheap and you generally get you what you pay for. Before you go into sticker shock, do keep in mind that safari lodges are typically all-inclusive—so food, lodge, alcohol, and game drives are usually included. The only extra cost will be your flights.When you start considering the details of your trip, read through my guide on how much to budget for an African safari.Generally speaking, I’d highly recommend going for all-inclusive options. While you will see some cheaper options out there, be wary of any all-inclusive stay for less than $1,000 per night. The money you could save will come at the cost of your experience as well as the local ecosystem.If you want to reduce your cost, take a shorter trip. You can have an amazing two-night stay then move onto the more affordable nearby areas to explore nature without doing a formal safari.

I’ve gone on two road trips through Namibia, and I have plans to go back a third time to venture further north to Etosha and up the Skeleton Coast.On my first trip to Namibia, I organized a girls’ trip with one of my closest friends. We had an incredible adventure and stayed in some of Namibia’s most beautiful lodges. At Little Kulala, we watched the hot air balloons go up into the sky while we had breakfast. While staying at Wolwedans Dune Lodge, we went on a game drive, and I got to capture the iconic Oryx (a large antelope)!On my second adventure, I went on a road trip with my friend, Travis. We stayed at the beautiful Spitzkoppe Lodge and visited the Erongo Wilderness, Swakopmund, Soussuvlei and Walvis Bay.The highlight of that trip was our 4×4 Dunes Meet the Ocean Tour through Namib Naukluft Park—we got to see an incredible piece of coastline, unlike any beach I’ve ever seen, where the sapphire South Atlantic Ocean meets the endless deserts of Namibia.Namibia is a massive country to explore, and there’s so much to see and do.

I’ve gone twice, and there is still so much that I want to explore!From the remote Skeleton Coast to the beautiful Sossusvlei dunes and the beautiful luxury accommodation, it’s an incredible destination for travelers who love road trips, nature and adventure.Your itinerary for Namibia and the regions you want to visit will play a big part in deciding when to travel to the country. If you’re after a world-class safari in Etosha National Park, you’ll want to skip the hot summer months, but if you’re a budget traveler, that’s when you’ll find incredible flight deals.To help you plan your trip, I’ve put together a guide on the best time to travel to Namibia!    July to OctoberJuly to October is peak season in Namibia. The winter and spring temperatures mean cooler weather, making Namibia road trips across the desert more bearable.You’ll also have excellent game viewings at Etosha National Park in the north, and you’ll get to see some of Namibia’s unique desert wildlife along the Skeleton Coast and Damaraland.If you’re a photographer, the winter months are also excellent for astrophotography!The only downside to visiting Namibia during this time is the prices. Accommodation at the best lodges and even the campsites book out months in advance and flights are at their most expensive.The winter months are considered the best time to visit Sossusvlei. The air is clear of dust, and you’ll have a beautiful contrast of the red dunes against the blue skies.If you can, plan to enter the park as soon as it opens at 6 am. The morning light is perfect for photographers, and you’ll get to watch the dunes change colour as the sun rises.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Road Trip Itinerary   DeadvleiApril to JuneApril to June is Namibia’s shoulder season months. The hot summer temperatures start to cool down, and the landscape is green from all the rain.It’s an excellent time to visit the country’s national parks as the high season crowds have yet to arrive and game viewing starts to pick up. However, I’d still book your accommodation well in advance, as South Africa has school and public holidays over these months and tourism to Namibia starts picking up.Keep an eye on flight prices for Namibia as well. The airlines will start to increase airfares as the country enters winter and high season for tourism begins.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Travel Guide    November to MarchBetween November and March, the temperatures in Namibia are at their hottest. You can expect an average day to reach well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, making it an unpopular time to travel to the country.However, if you can handle the heat, it’s the best time to visit Namibia if you’re a budget traveler. Airlines drop their rates to make up for the seasonal lull, and you won’t have to deal with long lines of people outside top attractions like Sossusvlei.Be sure to pack a reusable water bottle and stay hydrated!I’d also skip Etosha National Park and plan a road trip through Skeleton Coast National Park. There’s less fog in the summer months and the nights are warmer, making it ideal if you’re camping your way through the country.If you’re a bird lover, the summer months are the best time to visit Namibia. Many of the country’s migratory birds arrive with the rains, and you’ll see thousands of pink flamingos and Blue Cranes.You can also head to Damaraland to see the Herero chat and Monteiro’s hornbill!Read More: Tips for Visiting Sossusvlei in Namibia   SpitzkoppenOverallNamibia is a great year-round destination.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-little-kulala-in-namibia/,Staying at Little Kulala in Namibia,Namibia,"Namibia is one of my favorite African countries to visit. Just north of South Africa, the country is a photographer’s dream with miles of empty deserts, skeletons of shipwrecks buried in dunes and national parks that boast incredible safari experiences.During my first trip to Namibia, I stayed at the Little Kulala, a desert oasis that first opened its doors in 1996. The land used to have very little indigenous wildlife until Wilderness Safaris stepped in and helped rehabilitate the property to what it is today.Most people stay at Little Kulala because it is located just outside of Sossusvlei making it easy to visit iconic landmarks like Big Daddy Dune and Deadvlei.Ready for the ultimate desert oasis? Here’s what it’s like staying at the Little Kulala!Getting to Little KulalaThe lodge is located inside the Kulala Wilderness Reserve. The entrance is only a short 10-miles from Sesriem and is the gateway to Namibia’s Sand Sea.If you’re short on time, the quickest way to get here is to take a bush plane into Sossusvlei and then take a short car ride into the reserve. We opted to rent a car in Namibia and drove from Walvis Bay to the lodge in our 4×4 as part of a Southern Namibia road trip.Read More: 10 Essential Tips for Road-Tripping in Namibia    Little Kulala LodgeDrawing a lot of inspiration from the surrounding environment, Little Kulala describes itself as an organic camp, with neutral colors, natural light, and a lot of texture. It’s made up of 11-climate controlled villas, where guests get to experience ultimate escape in Namibia’s desert.Aside from the individual villas, the common area offers a library, wine cellar, craft boutique, lounge, and dining area.There’s also a larger pool in the communal area that’s picture perfect with expansive views of the red desert.      Sunrise Bed at Little KulalaThe RoomsThe rooms at Little Kulala are inspired by Deadvlei. Each of the 11 thatched “kulalas” come with a private plunge pool that overlooks the beautiful desert plains.The villas also feature a romantic Star Bed – perfect for an evening of stargazing or a sunrise cuddle to watch the hot air balloons take flight!I loved the minimalist African design of the interiors! The lodge has done an excellent job of bringing touches of the desert inside and creating a magical experience.    Food and DrinkThere are a lot of delicious options when it comes to food and drinks at Little Kulala. Breakfast options include cereals, fruits, yogurts, toast, muffins, cold meats, and more to get you ready for your daily activities.Dinner includes things like soups, salads, beef, chicken, and vegetarian options. There’s both indoor and outdoor seating – I recommend arriving just before golden hour so you can snag a good spot to watch the sunset over the desert!   Hot Air Balloon Rides at Little KulalaActivities at Little KulalaMost activities that you can enjoy are included with the price of your stay, and you have the choice to do as you please.Sossusvlei & Deadvlei: Only a short drive away, Deadvlei and Sossusvlei offer two unique landscape experiences. Sossusvlei is flanked by its famous dunes, and nearby Deadvlei is a white clay pan that’s contrasted against the dead camel thorn trees.You can also climb Big Daddy dune!ATVing: This was one of the excursions that I went on, and I had a blast! We drove through the Kulala Wilderness Reserve and had the opportunity to spot wildlife like oryx, springbok, and the adorable bat-eared foxes!Nature Drives: With over 91,000 acres of land, there are endless amounts of landscape and wildlife to be seen. Keep an eye out for the bat-eared foxes, brown hyaenas, bird life, and the oryx, known as the unicorn of the desert.Hot Air Balloon Rides: While seeing the reserve from land is a great way to see all that it has to offer, taking a hot air balloon safari gives you a whole new perspective. Though this one is an additional cost, it is absolutely worth it to see the dunes from the sky!Sesriem Canyon: Due to millions of years of water running, this canyon is well worth a visit. Today it sits just shy of 2-miles long and the views from the top are breathtaking!Scorpion Night Walks: For a unique experience, venture out into Namibia’s desert at night. After the sun sets, the arid landscape comes alive, and you can catch glimpses of scorpions that glow in the dark.Read More: Tips for Visiting Sossusvlei in Namibia    OverallI had an amazing time at Little Kulala! The accommodation, food, and activities exceed my expectations, and I’d love to come back in the future.The only downside is that the lodge is outside of the national park, which we didn’t realize when we booked. You can only access the park before sunrise if you are staying within it.If you are set on hiking Big Daddy at sunrise or visiting Deadvlei at the first light of the morning you’ll need to choose other accommodation within the park limits.More InformationAccommodation: Boutique, Luxury, WildlifeLocation: Kulala Wilderness Reserve, NamibiaPrice: $$$ "

There’s a massive deck with a lounge area, a swimming pool with hammocks and two dining areas.The lodge also organizes sunrise hot air balloon rides and guided game drives!Read More: Staying at Wolwedans Dunes Lodge in Namibia   Also within the NamibRand Nature Reserve is the Wolwedans Boulders Safari Camp.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-wear-in-namibia-outfit-inspiration/,What to Wear in Namibia + Outfit Inspiration,Namibia,"Namibia was one of the most unique and stunning countries I’ve been to. On my first trip, I road tripped through the country hitting highlights like Sossusvlei, Wolwedans Dunes Lodge, and Wolwedans Boulder Safari Camp, and on my second trip, I took a 4×4 tour along the Skeleton Coast and stayed at the Spitzkoppen Lodge!On both trips, I learned that you’ll want to pack a few different types of outfits when trying to figure out what to wear in Namibia.You’ll want pieces you don’t mind getting dirty (there’s a lot of dust out in the desert!), ones that are comfortable to explore in, some safari appropriate pieces, a few outfits for lounging around your camp or lodge, and of course, some warm clothes for nighttime.Both times I visited Namibia, in April and November, we were lucky enough to experience sunny and warm weather — so I rocked everything from sundresses to lightweight cargo pants and tank tops. During our time on the coast, there was quite a bit of wind so a scarf is a lifesaver to tame crazy hair and block the mouth and eyes from the sand!Generally, April and May are the best months to travel to Namibia, as it’s dry season and lots of greenery around central and eastern Namibia.You may run into some rainstorms between December and March, but it can get down to freezing temperatures at night between June and August, so be sure to research right before you go! As with most places, Namibia’s weather patterns are slowly changing, so I recommend bringing at least one warm jacket, just in case you run into a cold front at night.In the months of September and October, Namibia will start warming up again and there are great opportunities for an awesome, African safari experience.Check out my Namibia outfit inspiration below!Actual: Skinny Cargo Pant / Scarf / Combat Boots / Lightweight WindbreakerCheck out these items to wear for safaris, off-roading, and exploring the desert and coastlines of Namibia!!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1525210800461?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');  Check out these items for lounging and relaxing around your camp or lodge in Namibia!!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1525210800461?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');  Don’t miss my African Safari Packing Guide for more packing tips + outfit inspo!Side Note: Yes, this white dress shot is “extra” of me,  but Namibia shoots so beautifully in flowy dresses, so if you’re looking to shoot some lifestyle shots while you’re there, be sure to pack a flowy dress or two, and you’ll find it’s perfect against the harsh desert landscape.Do you have any packing tips for Namibia?

https://theblondeabroad.com/dunes-meets-the-ocean-4x4-tour-in-namibia/,“Dunes Meet the Ocean” 4×4 Tour in Namibia,Namibia,"On the southwestern coast of Africa, you’ll find one of the most underrated tourist destinations on the planet. Far off the beaten path, this golden slice of Namibia may not be at the top of many people’s travel bucket lists, but it’s so worth the trip.Part of the Namib Naukluft Park, this incredible piece of coastline is unlike any beach you’ve seen. This dramatic six-mile-long lagoon is where the sapphire South Atlantic Ocean meets the endless deserts of Namibia.Get ready to fall in love with the world’s oldest desert. Here’s my experience doing a “Dunes Meets the Ocean” 4×4 Tour in Namibia.The RouteWalvis Bay is the typical starting point for any tour of Sandwich Harbour. This small seaside city is famous for its flamingos, pelicans, and migrating whales. It’s worth a stop here to take a kayak trip out to Pelican Point, or you can catch a ride down to Sandwich Harbour, which is about thirty miles (fifty kilometers) south of town.Tip: You’ll see a few names for this place, including Sandwich Bay, Sandvishawe, Sandvisbaai, and Sandfisch Bai, so don’t worry if your tour operator uses any of these variations.Before you leave the city, I recommend that you take a trip up to Walvis Bay Lagoon to see the flamingos. After that, you’ll head down through the Kuiseb River Delta, and from there, you’ll be down to Sandwich Harbour in no time.It’s important to note that the weather and tide affect access to the Sandwich Harbour. When the tide is too high, you won’t be able to drive in there. While you can predict the daily high tide, the weather is impossible to know for certain; there are no guarantees.That’s not a total deal-breaker though. The best views ultimately come from the high dunes overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Road Trip ItineraryTouring Sandwich HarbourYou’ll find a range of tour companies in Namibia offering both half- and full-day tours. They will usually take you through the Walvis Bay Lagoon, Kuiseb River Delta, Sandwich Bay, and Sandwich Harbour and stop for wildlife viewing.You can take an organized tour or go solo. For this trip, I headed out with Entangola Namibia Desert Tours (they don’t have a website, but you can reach them directly at this phone number: +264-81-128-6910). A full-day private tour only cost us NAD3500 or about $289 US for two of us.Driving in Namibia on your own is a fantastic experience, but it’s one that you need to be prepared for. At a minimum, you need a 4×4 vehicle.That means that you have to be comfortable operating a big vehicle, and it’s also essential to be confident about driving a manual car.Think you’re ready for the ultimate African road trip?

Few things rival the freedom of taking to wide-open desert roads, and that just happens to be the best way to get to the Spitzkoppen Lodge.It’s about a four-and-a-half-hour drive from Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. If you are taking off from the coastal city of Swakopmund (another must-see destination) you will be looking at a three-hour trip.Because Namibia is off the beaten path for most tourists, it’s good to have someone on the ground to help you out. I worked with Matador Network and ATIholidays to plan the trip, and it made the process so easy.Read More: 10 Essential Tips for Road Tripping in NamibiaThe Spitzkoppen LodgeThe hotel is nestled between 150-million-year-old granite boulders and seemingly endless mountains of apricot sand.As soon as I arrived at the lodge, I was greeted with a welcome drink and taken on a short trip to my chalet. With a minimalist aesthetic, every aspect of the property blends into the rugged landscape in true glamping fashion.The Rooms at Spitzkoppen LodgeThe Spitzkoppen Lodge has fifteen one-of-a-kind chalets, which offer you VIP service all the way. Instead of being just another number, you’ll feel right at home from the second you walk in the door.Each chalet offers a 360-degree view of the granite boulders from a private viewing deck. It is the perfect place to unwind and soak in the sun. Tastefully furnished with elegant touches at every turn, each chalet has an en-suite bathroom.Food + DrinkBooking a chalet includes a fresh complimentary local breakfast. Later in the day, you’ll want to make your way down to the dining, lounge and bar areas. The space opens to the split-level pool deck and the natural rock pool, which has views worthy of your Instagram feed.Plan your dinner so you can watch the sunset behind the Brandberg Mountain while trying out some of southern Africa’s best traditional dishes.Activities at Spitzkoppen LodgeAt the Spitzkoppen Lodge, the focus is on the incredible geological landscape. Explore the hidden rock art, wander through the caves and bring your camera on the hiking trail that’s just waiting to be photographed.One of the biggest highlights from my travels in Namibia is the Skeleton Coast. Don’t miss a 4×4 Dune Tour!Before you leave the lodge, be sure to check out the little shop at the Spitzkoppen Lodge. It’s full of handcrafted wonders and gemstones carved by local miners.Watch my Namibia travel video!More InformationHotel: Spitzkoppen LodgeLocation: NamibiaAccommodation: Mid-RangePrice Range: $$Special thanks to Spitzkoppen Lodge for hosting me during my stay.

It’s got a beautiful beachfront location, and it is flamingo adjacent!From Windhoek You can fly into Windhoek then drive out to Sossusvlei, which will also take around five hours. The capital and biggest city of Namibia, you’ll have tons of overnight options in Windhoek. The most popular picks are the international faves, AVANI, and Hilton Windhoek.If you’re only there for one night, I’d recommend staying downtown so you can do some sightseeing.

Check out a few of my Tips for Renting a Car in Namibia.Where to Stay in SossusvleiandBeyond’s Sossusvlei Desert Lodge: This intimate spot features just ten villas surrounded by wilderness as far as the eye can see.

These midnight black trees speckled across cracked white clay create an incredible vista.You’ll have to walk around 20 minutes from the parking lot to get to Deadvlei so, as always in the desert, bring plenty of water!Quad BikingThe best way to see Sossusvlei is to get off the beaten path and into the depths of the desert. We took quad bikes around on a tour and were able to see some stunning views.Keep your eyes peeled for the famous fairy circles (the desert’s version of crop circles).Star GazingOnce you see the starry night sky in Sossusvlei, you’ll be spoiled for life.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-wolwedans-dunes-lodge-in-namibia/,Staying at Wolwedans Dunes Lodge in Namibia,Namibia," The timeless beauty of the Namibian desert is incredible. When you are away from the city, it’s as if time stops. Standing in the middle of it all, it’s easy to imagine what life was like fifty or even 500 years ago.From the Wolwedans Dunes Lodge in Namibia, the vast area of Sossusvlei feels boundless. Whether you opt to stay at one of the eighteen bedrooms at the Dunes Lodge, the exclusive Mountain View Suite, Boulders Safari Camp, or the private camp, you’ll fall head over heels in love with Namibia there.Here’s my experience staying at Wolwedans Dunes Lodge in Namibia!Getting ThereThe great thing about Wolwedans Dunes Lodge is that it’s far from the hustle and bustle of city life— really, really far! You’re looking at 260 miles from Windhoek, around 265 miles from Swakopmund, and 245 miles from Walvis Bay.The drive is gorgeous though, and Namibia is definitely a place where you will want to rent a car to explore at your own pace.Namibia’s capital, Windhoek, is a modern city with a fun European vibe that is well worth exploring. It’s a good place to start your adventure; but to see the real treasures of the country, it’s best to get out of the city and start exploring the wild side of Namibia.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Road Trip ItineraryThe LodgeSet atop a dune plateau, the Wolwedans Dunes Lodge has a panoramic view of the unforgettable beauty of Sossusvlei. The main lodge has two chic and cozy lounge areas, a wine cellar, two communal dining rooms, a tea deck, a library, and a massive deck for relaxing while you enjoy the great outdoors.Every area opens to a veranda where you can meet other travelers, take in the view, and forget about the world. There’s also a swimming pool surrounded by hammocks and lounge chairs that are made for spending lazy afternoons under the sun.The RoomsThe Wolwedans Dunes Lodge features nine beautiful chalets, each with its own en suite bathroom and private veranda. The rooms are perfect for glamping and taking in the stunning views.You can open the canvas blinds all the way up to feel like your sleeping outside, or you can close things down for the night to feel like you’re alone in the vast wilderness.I’d recommend booking a massage to enjoy from your chalet. With a cool breeze and the quiet stillness of the desert, it’s seriously relaxing. In the early morning, staff also leaves a tray with hot coffee, tea, and small cookies.I’d wake up each day at sunrise and watch Oryx walk past my tent!Food and DrinkThe chefs at Wolwedans are always ready to impress, and this place is widely considered to have the best food of any Namibian safari option. With an elegant table setting and the chicest of bush cuisine, the lodge offers meals that are an indulgent but unpretentious affair.Everything at Wolwedans Dunes Lodge is local, organic, and freshly prepared.

While you’ll have access to electricity and WiFi in the basecamp, I’d recommend going low-tech or no-tech.The tents don’t have electricity, TV, or air conditioning. Plan on bringing lightweight clothes and old-school books (or a charged up Kindle).Of the different accommodation options with Wolwedans, the Dunes Lodge is the most easily accessible one.

Namibia is a gorgeous place to explore by car, and you will definitely want to take your time exploring. The Wolwedans Boulders Safari Camp isn’t centrally located, but that’s the beauty in it.The main Wolwedans Dunes Lodge is located 260 miles from Windhoek, about 265 miles from Swakopmund, and 245 miles from Walvis Bay, so you can fly into any of the major airports in Namibia and drive down in about the same distance.Both Wolwedans properties are absolutely stunning. The Dunes Lodge is a bit more comfortable and connected while the Boulders Safari Camp, located another 27 miles south of the lodge, is more remote and intimate.Read More: 10 Essential Tips for Road Tripping in NamibiaThe CampThe Wolwedans Boulders Safari Camp in Namibia is all about eco-tourism.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-renting-a-car-in-namibia/,Tips for Renting a Car in Namibia,Namibia,"Namibia is the ultimate road trip destination. One of the planet’s most sparsely populated nations, this place is full of gorgeous and diverse scenery. If you want to see Africa at its finest, hit the wide-open roads here and start exploring– and be sure to check my essential tips on traveling through Namibia.Here are my tips for renting a car in Namibia!4×4 is EssentialYou absolutely need a 4×4 vehicle. I’ve heard too many horror stories from travelers who have ended up rolling their cars. It’s a real case of “go big, or go home.”Namibian roads just aren’t built for sedans. Gravel roads are typically vaulted in the middle so if you’re driving on the edge and you need to quickly swerve, you’ve got a very good chance of rolling a lightweight vehicle.Read More: 10 Essential Tips for Road-Tripping in NamibiaPick the Right CompanyWe went through Hertz Car Rental at the airport in Walvis Bay and had a good experience. While there are some good local rental companies, I usually opt for an international company.Your car is the most important element of a road trip, so you don’t want any surprises.Whichever company you opt to use, make sure that you check out reviews in advance and read all of the fine print.Auto vs ManualKeep in mind that the vast majority of cars in Namibia are manual. If you’ve never learned how to drive a stick or you aren’t confident in your abilities, it’s time to learn!Knowing how to drive a manual is an absolutely essential skill if you’re going to be spending time outside of North America. If you don’t have time to learn, you can usually get an automatic car for a slightly higher price if you book in advance.InsuranceGet it! Insurance is critical for road trips, and it’s the last place to try to save cash. I also highly recommend getting World Nomads travel insurance to cover any other surprises.It was extremely useful during my road trip Iceland. The wind blew the door open and bent the frame, which resulted in 2,000 euros’ worth of damage. My World Nomads Explorer travel insurance policy covered it and also paid for a visit to a doctor while I was there.GasWhen you are at a gas station, always fill up. There are many areas of the country where gas stations are few and far between, and you never want to run on empty.Get in the habit of stopping regularly to top off; it’ll be one less thing that you have to worry about.Spare TiresMake sure that you have at least one (ideally two) spare tires. And, just as important, make sure you know how to change them. The damsel in distress routine won’t get you far on empty desert roads, so master the essential DIY car fixes.Be PreparedThe beauty of Namibia is its raw natural beauty. The downside to that is that you won’t find fast food and convenience stores on every corner, so pack lots of water and snacks.It’s better to err on the side of packing too much than to be roaming the desert famished.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Road Trip ItineraryDo you have any tips for driving through Namibia?"

Namibia is unlike anywhere else I’ve ever been before. One of the most sparsely populated places on Earth, Namibia feels like another planet sometimes.With wide-open spaces filled with incredible sand dunes and wild African game roaming the land, this country deserves a spot on any traveler’s bucket list. Namibia is a year-round destination, and it’s one of the best spots on the planet for a road trip—it’s also an adventure that requires a bit of planning.Here are 10 essential tips for road-tripping in Namibia!Safety in NamibiaI road-tripped Namibia with my girlfriend Misha, and as two girls traveling alone, our biggest concerns were breakdowns and flat tires. We learned that the locals are super friendly, and it’s one of the safest countries in Africa to road trip.Opt for a Tough VehicleForget about sporty, cute cars. Go for a rough and tumble 4×4 in Namibia! They are incredibly popular here and for good reason. The roads vary a lot, and it’s best to opt for an all-terrain vehicle. Even if you do end up staying primarily on the main routes, it’s good to have the option to go wherever you want.I opted to rent a car from Hertz in Walvis Bay!Make sure that you have at least one (ideally two) spare tires and an emergency kit. And, just as important, make sure you know how to change them. You’ll want to have everything that you need for fixes like flat tires and other small repairs. If you’ve never changed a tire, study up on it before your big adventure– in fact, plan to change at least one along the way.Pack a first aid kit too, and familiarize yourself with everything in it. You might not always have a solid internet connection you need to Google life hacks.Read More: Tips for Renting a Car in NamibiaPrepare to Entertain YourselfNamibia is huge. It’s twice the size of places like Germany or California, yet it has a population of just two million people. It’s one of the least densely populated countries on earth.Very often, it’ll be nothing but you and the wide-open wonderland.It’s the ultimate getaway, but that also means you’re on your own for everything; so have a plan. Bring your own entertainment and extras of anything you can’t live without.Pack Everything You’ll NeedThe vast spaces of Namibia are what make it so beautiful. At the same time, that means you can’t count on stopping by a convenience store every time you need something. Make a list of everything you could possibly need, and double check it all before you go.Layering is key in Namibian weather. It can go from ninety degrees to thirty degrees in one day, so make sure you’ll be able to stay comfortable in a range of conditions.Keep in mind that you’ll be traveling through the desert, so bring sunscreen, sunglasses, moisturizer, and lip balm.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to NamibiaWatch for AnimalsIt’s essential to keep your eyes peeled; especially around remote areas. Many animals there aren’t used to traffic.They can run out in front of your car in a flash, so keep your eyes on the road. Many animals are especially active around sunrise and sunset, and you’ll want to have your copilot keep watch of the roadsides.Get Off the FreewaySome of Namibia’s best spots are remote; expect to do some off-roading. When you look at the map, you’ll see that some roads have a D or C listed in front of the number. More often than not, these are dirt roads, and some of them are a bit rough.Just take it slow, and keep going—it’s well worth it!Fuel UpWhen you’re on national roads, you’ll find a fairly regular stream of gas stations, but they can be rare in some areas. There are road maps that will show you where you can fill up, which is handy. Just make sure that your map is current because things like that can change.Gas costs around 95 cents per liter (around $3.55 per gallon) and some gas stations accept only cash. Rule of thumb: Any time you see a gas station, fill up.Make sure you plan accordingly.Bring CashCash is king in Namibia, and ATMs aren’t always easy to find, so make sure you can cover your costs. The country uses the Namibian dollar (NAD), and 1 US dollar is worth around 12.75 Namibian dollars.Take it SlowWhile you might feel like you’re in your own little world, there are surprises around every bend. Careless driving can put a serious damper on your trip, so take it slow and steady. On top of the risk of accidents, there are a surprising number of traffic police are around the area.The fines are hefty for speeding.It’s very common to feel your car drift on the loose gravel. We lost control a couple times but were going slow enough to get back on track safely.Vintage Google MapsYou’ll find spotty phone reception in Namibia, so don’t plan to rely on your phone for directions. A dedicated GPS device (that can work offline) is your best bet. It’s also important to have a good old-fashioned paper map that has your entire route planned out.The Best Road Trips Routes in NamibiaNamibia is a big country, but you can still drive to all of the best sites. I highly recommend devoting at least a full week to your visit if possible, but there are some great routes that you can tackle for any time period.Here are a few of the best road trip options in Namibia:Three Days: Travel from Windhoek or Walvis Bay to Sossusvlei passing through the cute town of Solitaire to explore the breathtaking sand dunes.Three Days: Go North from Windhoek to Okahandja, Otjiwarongo, and Outjo for an amazing DIY safari through Etosha Park.Six Days: Head from Windhoek up to the Etosha National Park then back to Windhoek before you drive over to the Namib Desert to explore the sand dunes.Ten Days: Start in Windhoek, and then make your way to Waterberg Plateau, Damaraland, Swakopmund, Sossusvlei, and back to Windhoek.Read More: The Ultimate Namibia Road Trip ItineraryDo you have any tips for driving in Namibia?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-pack-for-an-african-safari/,What to Pack for an African Safari,Namibia,"Updated: October 2019An African safari was one of my biggest bucket list experiences and, I’ll be honest, at first, I was confronted with a completely new packing dilemma — what should I pack for a safari?I had done an elephant safari in Sri Lanka and spent a couple of days at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa, but since then, I’ve explored many game reserves throughout the top safari destinations in Africa, including Namibia, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, and have refined my safari packing list.When you’re staying in and exploring the bush, my best advice is to choose comfort above all things. But, comfortable doesn’t have to mean frumpy. A cute safari style is easily achieved with comfortable layers that will keep you warm on early morning game drives and cool during hot afternoons back at your accommodation.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for your own safari trip!My African Safari Trip DetailsLocation: KenyaTravel Dates: Late-MarchSeason: Beginning of Wet SeasonWeather: We had beautiful weather around Maasai Mara in late-March. However, March to May marks the wet season across much of Kenya.In the peak of the rainy season most other parks, especially in the highlands and the coastal parks, can be problematic with regards to heat, humidity, and continuous rain. June through October and January-February are typically high season and offer the best weather.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African SafariWhat to Expect on an African SafariDepending on the destination you’re traveling to, most game drives are in the early morning (around 5 or 6am) returning around 11am and in the evening (around 4pm) returning just after sunset.Helpful Tip: “Safaris” are typically referred to as “game drives” around Africa.Morning Game Drive: It is typically quite cold on the early morning game drives, so you’ll want to wear lots of layers and remove them as the morning sun gets warmer.When staying at Mahali Mzuri and Cottar’s Camp in Kenya, they provided hot water bags on our early morning game drives to help keep us warm as well!After exploring for a few hours, your guides might set up a bush breakfast or coffee and tea for you to enjoy before heading back. You’ll typically return to your accommodation before the heat of the day really sets in.Evening Game Drive: Your evening game drive starts when the warm sun is still up, but expect the temperature to drop quickly — especially at sunset. Most evening game drives involve a couple of hours of exploring and end with sundowners (evening drinks at sunset) and snacks before heading back.You’ll definitely want to have layers for your evening drive as it can get pretty chilly with the wind.Read More: Top Things to Look for When Choosing a Safari LodgeHow to Choose an African Safari (That’s Right for You)Luggage Requirements and Baggage AllowanceTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance if you have to take a bush flight. When traveling from Nairobi to the Maasai Mara, my flight with Safari Link had some pretty strict requirements.Unfortunately, they only allowed 15 kgs / 33 lbs inclusive of hand luggage. That meant all of my camera gear and camera bag (zoom lenses, cameras, etc.), my purse, toiletries, and clothes all had to weigh less than what I’d normally pack in a carry-on.I ended up having to leave behind a ton of clothes and even my tripod. It was a HUGE bummer but they are very strict with their policies. Fortunately, they offered free luggage storage. But, if you are connecting in multiple airports and not returning to your original airport, you’ll need to take everything with you.You also might not be allowed to use a hard suitcase if they require “soft” suitcases. That means you’ll need to use a soft bag, like a duffel bag.I always travel with this wheeled duffel bag that collapses easily!My advice, again, is to triple check your airline luggage requirements, pack LIGHT and use a soft duffel bag.What to Pack for an African SafariKeep in mind neutral, earth tones for your safari wardrobe! Dark colors will attract heat, and make sure to avoid blue or black clothing as they attract tsetse flies (if you’re in an area with them). !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Not only will it keep you warm on the sunrise and sunset game drives, but it can also be used to keep the dust out of your face.3. Sunglasses // Protect your eyes, and keep some dust out of them while you’re at it.4. Socks & Underwear // Trust me on this, bring a LOT of socks and undies. You get pretty dirty while on the game drives and you’ll want to keep changing to feel fresh.Helpful Tip: You’ll also want to bring along gloves for warmth and earplugs for the nighttime noises. *cue hippo snoring*5. ONA Camera Bag // I typically travel with the ONA Camps Bay backpack, since it can fit all of my gear, however, since I had to pack lighter for the safari, a bag like the ONA Prince Street Messenger was an awesome choice.

Denim Shirt // They look super cute under vests and jackets and are perfect for layering.10. Fleece Jacket // Don’t forget a super warm, and comfortable, jacket for sunrise or nighttime drives. A fleece checks both boxes!If you are a “cold” person, meaning you’re always cold, I would highly recommend bringing a down jacket for extra warmth on the early morning drives! Check the weather before you go and use your best judgment.Helpful Tip: Most safari tours and game reserves will have ponchos for you should it rain!

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-traveling-amsterdam-on-a-budget/,Tips for Traveling Amsterdam on a Budget,Netherlands,"Beyond the smoky coffee shops and seedy red-light district, Amsterdam is a dynamic city. A cycling paradise with a fascinating history, this Northern European city is an essential stop.It was so hard to narrow it down to the top ten things you must do in Amsterdam and it’s really one of those cities you can come back to time and time again. And, of course, you’ll want to venture through the rest of the Netherlands as well!Whatever you do and wherever you go, one thing is going to strike you about Amsterdam: it’s expensive!Your euro just doesn’t stretch as far here as it would in Madrid or Rome. However, you still can have an unforgettable adventure without breaking the bank!Here are a few of my key tips for traveling Amsterdam on a budget!Visit During the Shoulder SeasonsThe golden rule of urban European travel is to visit during the famous shoulder season. Avoid summer at all costs and book for spring or autumn. The weather is flawless. The crowds are gone. Best of all, the prices are lower.Amsterdam and the Netherlands, in general, have their own unique flow of tourists so a bit of extra planning is required.One of the peak travel times in the Netherlands when is when the tulips are in bloom. Generally, this is early to mid-April. While the fields of endless tulips are stunning, you’ll pay a premium to see them. So, if you’re not super into it, skip it.Another big event in the Netherlands is King’s Day. Celebrating the birthday of King Willem-Alexander, this is a huge deal across the country. On the 27th of April every year, there are massive street parties. While they’re a blast, they are also pricey.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to the Netherlands   Finding a Place to StayIt’s easy to get around Amsterdam so staying in the center of the city isn’t important. In fact, you can find some nicer and more spacious places just outside of the central area.Affordable neighborhoods like De Pijp, Plantagebuurt, or Jordaan are perfect bases for exploring the city.Airbnbs around the city can save you money. Look for something that is close to public transport or just rent a bike.Alternatively, hostels can be a great way to meet other travelers, which is especially nice if you are traveling solo. Check out the neighborhood called Noord. It’s an up and coming spot that is full of cheap but amazing places to crash!   Booking.com  (function(d, sc, u) {      var s = d.createElement(sc), p = d.getElementsByTagName(sc)[0];      s.type = 'text/javascript';      s.async = true;      s.src = u + '?v=' + (+new Date());      p.parentNode.insertBefore(s,p);      })(document, 'script', '//aff.bstatic.com/static/affiliate_base/js/flexiproduct.js');Use Public Transportation or BikeAmsterdam is relatively small and walkable. It’s easy to get around on foot and, if you get tired, public transport covers all areas of the city.Not only is public transportation in Amsterdam cheap, but it’s also quick.A trip that might cost you 20 euros in a taxi will run 2.80 euros on the tram and you’ll get there in less time. If you do really need a car, opt for Uber but don’t expect it to be faster than walking.Of course, if you want to get around like a local, it’s all about the bikes! They are the main mode of transport and a perfect way to see it all. You will find bike rental options all over town starting at 7.50 euros per day. Helpful Tip:Be careful in bike lanes! Be mindful of the fact that people are commuting by bike. You wouldn’t stand in the middle of a street or stop your car randomly. Treat the bike lane with the same respect both for your safety and the safety of others.Get an Unlimited  Ticket for the TramsIf you want to cover a lot of ground, you can save some serious cash with unlimited public transport tickets.Some options like the I amsterdam City Card offers free entry into local attractions like museums or you can get a simple 24 hr travel card that’ll get you anywhere you need to go for 8 euros.You can save some cash getting a GVB Multi-day ticket or, if you’ll be there for a long period, check out the GVB Reloadable Travel Cards. Just note it’s important to use these within the set zones. This means that travel to and from the airport, or places farther afield, aren’t included.Before you buy, check out the full overview on all of the public transport card in Amsterdam so you know which one makes the most sense for your trip.You can buy any of the time-based travel cards on trams and buses, stations, and all over the city. Check the full map here. Stroopwafel Poffertjes Local Foods to TryBudget BitesOne of my fave spots to eat in Amsterdam is the Foodhallen. They have live music most nights and the best selection of food that you will find anywhere in the city.Luckily for you, I took the liberty of eating my way around the city to save you the trouble of taste tasting! After extensive research, here are what I found to be the ten best food in all of the Netherlands. Keep a lookout for them as you browse menus.Grocery Stores and MarketsIf you are staying at an Airbnb or other self-catering option, look for discount grocery stores like Lidl, Aldi, Dirk van den Broek, or VOMAR.For the cheapest—and the best!—food in the Amsterdam, look no further than the famous food markets of Amsterdam. They are the perfect place for groceries and you’ll find a few good grab-and-go options.The biggest of these is the renowned Albery Cuypmarkt. For more than 115 years, there have been 200+ vendors selling the best food in Amsterdam from 9 am to 5 pm, six days a week (closed on Sundays).On Saturdays, check out the organic farmers’ market on Noordermarkt or Nieuwmarkt Market; or nab a bargain at the Marqt – Farmers Market from 8 am to 9 pm, Monday through Saturday.For an impressive range of everything from Dutch sandwiches to Asian fruits, get to the Ten Katemarkt from Monday through Saturday, 9 am to 6 pm.Fast Food and Cheap EatsWho needs McDonald’s when you’ve got FEBO? These cool 24/7 robotic options are better than any vending machine you’ve ever seen. Do as the locals do and grab a 2 am croquette and fries after a night out from the famous FEBO.The next morning, it’s all about HEMA. This department store offers an incredible breakfast deal from 9 to 10 am. Grab a sandwich or croissant along with a hot drink for just 2 euros.Another cheap and cheerful pick is an eetcafé. This diner-style place offers simple and delicious eats for rock bottom prices.Keep your eyes peeled for street food like poffertjes, stroopwafels, kroket, and raw herring (when in Rome…), that are always a bargain.   Hang Out in VondelparkThe largest park in Amsterdam, Vondelpark, has an incredible ten million visitors per year. It is a fave amongst tourists and locals alike.Pack a picnic and get off your feet for a while to enjoy one of the most beautiful spaces in Amsterdam. And why not lunch like a local? Hit up one of the markets before you go to grab all of your supplies for the perfect Dutch picnic.Once you’re filled up and rested, grab your bike and take a tour around the park. There are guided options or you can go solo.Get a City CardOn top of giving you a deal on public transport, getting a city card will save you money on the best attractions.Major museums in Amsterdam are expensive. We are talking nearly 20 euros for places like the Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum (though FYI you can check out the surround sculpture gardens here for free).While things like the I amsterdam City Card are expensive, they can save money if used correctly. Look through the full list of attractions and offering to see if it’ll pay off for you. You get free food, transport, museum entry and more with the price of purchase.If you’ll really be pounding the streets all day long, you will easily end up spending more than the price of the card. Do some careful planning and work through the math.A five-day card, for example, only works out to 26 euros per day, which is an amazing bargain. A 24-hour card, on the other hand, is 65 euros, so it would only pay off with good planning.Another cool option is the Amsterdam City Pass. This one doesn’t include public transport but it gives you flexible time. If you’ll be in and out of Amsterdam for a week or so, this is the perfect way to pick and choose what you want to do without being tied to a strict schedule.The same company does a Museum Pass, that offers free transport to the airport and 20% off the top museums. There’s no time limit with this either so it’s handy for an open itinerary. Helpful Tip:You might hear people mention a Museum Pass offered by the city. This is now limited to Dutch residents only.If you don’t opt for a pass, I’d still recommend buying your tickets online. Popular places like the Anne Frank House tend to have incredibly long lines. With advanced purchase, you can walk right in the door.Free Walking TourFree walking tours are a top pick for me in any city! I love being able to get insider tips from locals and I find they usually better tours than the prepaid options.Be aware that tips are the norm on free walking tours!   NDSM WHARFSee Different Sites by FerryWhether you are on foot or biking, you can hop on the ferry to get across the IJ River. Not only will it give you an essential photo op, but it is also a cheap way to get around the city 24/7.BUIKSLATERWEGThis trip is the shortest of the three boat rides. This will take you over to the EYE Film Institute and A’DAM Toren Observation deck. This is the former location of the famous “I amsterdam” but that is now being restored and is planned to have a mobile location. The boat leaves every six minutes.UPLEINThis ride will take you through the residential area of Amsterdam and has many small shops along the way. The boat leaves every 10 minutes.NDSM WERFThis one is my fave! It will take you much farther out than the other two options. Once you are away from the shoreline, you will have a dreamy vista of the industrial harbor. The boat leaves every 30 minutes but it’s worth the wait if you have time.Free Theatre on TuesdaysTuesdays are the best time to be in Amsterdam!During lunchtime, head over to the Dutch National Opera & Ballet at Waterloo Square and get your hands on a free ticket. This incredible museum gives a gratis viewing session while they practice from 12:30 to 13:00 from September to May.OverallWhat are your tips for traveling Amsterdam on a budget?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-things-you-must-do-in-amsterdam/,10 Things You Must Do in Amsterdam,Netherlands,"Amsterdam is one of the most popular and fascinating destinations in Europe. A world-class foodie destination (check out my must-eat Dutch foods before you go) with a dynamic culture and layered history, this is an essential stop on the continent.While the famous “I am Amsterdam” sign is no longer there, it was just one of the many iconic experiences to be had.Truly, Amsterdam is so much more than its party scene. And the Netherlands is far more than Holland! While a lot of people call the whole country “Holland,” there are actually 12 provinces. But, before we move onto the wider area, let’s talk about the ultimate Dutch destination: Amsterdam.Here are the 10 things you must do in Amsterdam!Rent a BikeThere is a reason why they call Amersterdam the bike capital of the world. One of the Netherlands’ biggest claims to fame is having an average of 1.3 bicycles per person, which is more than any other country on the globe.To get the feel of local life, ride a bike around the canals. Just watch you don’t fall in! Around 15,000 bikes are excavated from the canals each year.   Try the Local FoodI would highly recommend trying a food tour!I find them to be the best way to try the local food. Wherever you go and whatever you try, there are bound to be dishes you prefer and others you dislike. A food tour will let you try a bit of everything without missing out or getting so full that you are bursting at the seams.While I’d definitely recommend trying the local cuisine, at minimum, you’ve got to be sure to sample stroopwafel at least once (though once you get a taste, that’ll probably turn into four or five times!).Book a recommended food tour here!Visit  the Famous MuseumsMuseums are an essential component of any trip to Amsterdam. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, and Anne Frank Museum are absolute must-sees.Amsterdam is one of the more expensive cities in Europe and the cost of visiting tourist spots like museums can add up quickly so I’d highly recommend looking into the I amsterdam City Card. It gives you free transport, entry into more than 70 museums, and a one-hour cruise through the city.   Visit  the Floating Flower MarketsThe only floating flower market in the world, Bloemenmarkt is an absolute treasure. Wander through the barges and pick out your own bouquet from the flower capital.The history of the floral world of Amsterdam is actually way more interesting than you’d think and well worth reading up on. The Tulip Mania that eventually led to the 1637 tulip market crash is a story you’d only find in the Netherlands.If you are lucky enough to visit the Netherlands from late March to mid-May, be sure to make a trip to Keukenhof Gardens, the world’s largest flower garden park.Wander Around the CanalsThe I amsterdam City Card is an affordable way to hop on a cruise through the famous canals of Amsterdam or you can go solo.It is equally beautiful if you go on foot or by bike too. Just plan plenty of time to snap pics as you go!Coffee Houses + Red Light DistrictAmsterdam is home to what could easily be called the world’s most famous red-light district. While it’s not exactly my scene, I would still say it’s worth wandering around to see what the area is all about.And it’s not all brothels! The Red Light District of Amsterdam has largely been transformed into an art and cafe district so there’s something for everyone these days.House of Bols TourHouse of Bols is one of the best tours I’ve ever been on (and I’ve been on more than my fair share of tours!).Learn about the history of traditional Genever, which is the Netherlands’ answer to gin, and experience a one-of-a-kind cocktail experience. Watch my video on my experience there to get an idea of what to expect.   Have a Picnic in VondelparkThere is nothing more quintessentially Dutch than to ride your bike over to Vondelpark for a picnic. Pack some sandwiches and salads or stop by the eatery in the park, Proeflokaal ‘t Blauwe Theehuis. They have amazing food and are famous for their tea selection as well.Visit the Albert Cuyp MarktThe days of the Dutch trading empire are gone but the love of a good barter remains.In the heart of the De Pijp neighborhood, you’ll find the Albert Cuyp Markt. It is where locals go to load up on fresh produce and meats every week as well as to grab a bouquet of flowers, have some lunch, and shop for knick-knacks…like the wooden tulips pictured!It is a prime place to find a souvenir (and, yes, bartering is expected)!  NDSM WharfNDSM WharfBeside the River IJ, the NDSM Wharf is a former shipyard turned hip hangout.There is a free ferry that runs back and forth from Centraal to here. When you arrive, you’ll find cool little cafes and happening restaurants. Chill on the beach for a few drinks then explore Europe’s largest flea market, which happens once per month. Check out their website to plan your trip.If you love second-hand markets and shops, you are going to be in heaven on April 27, King’s Day, when a whopping one in five Dutch people sells their wares on the street at the flea market to end all flea markets.Amsterdam is in the process of adding 2,000 houses in the area to establish a ‘district for urban pioneers’ which is a cool concept to bringing a creative vibe to a city that can feel overly touristy at times. Have you been to Amsterdam before? What would you add to this list? I’d love to hear in the comments below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-travel-to-the-netherlands/,The Best Time to Travel to the Netherlands,Netherlands,"Like other coastal countries in Europe, the Netherlands experiences all four seasons, with warm sunny summers and chilly winters marked with rainfall. Because of these seasons changing, choosing the best time to visit the country is fairly easy—as it’s truly dependent on what kind of weather and activities you’re after!When visiting, you’ll want to decide what’s on your bucket list and determine if you want to avoid the crowds or be part of them. Luckily, this guide will make choosing the best time to travel to the Netherlands a little bit easier!Here is my guide to choosing the best time to travel to the Netherlands! King's Day  April to MaySpringtime in the Netherlands starts out quite unpredictable. In fact, the Dutch even have a phrase “April doet wat het wil” which translates to “April does what it wants.” The beginning of April can be met with a rollercoaster ride of temps. One minute it is hot and the next you’ll find yourself bundled up begging for hot chocolate. Luckily, things warm up towards the end of the month. This is the perfect time for King’s Day—a public holiday held on the 27th. The locals celebrate with music festivals, canal parades, and fabulous open-air markets.Come May, the crowds begin to roll in as the weather continues to warm up and summer approaches. Though crowds aren’t a huge issue at this time, popular sites such as the Van Gogh Museum fill up quickly. Luckily there are many spots off the beaten path that are rarely busy and still allow you to get the full Netherlands experience.  RotterdamJune to AugustIf you’re looking for never-ending days, summer in the Netherlands is for you. With the sun not setting until around 10 pm, the days seem to last forever. This is the perfect time to visit the country’s golden beaches.Keep in mind that come July, the tourists have officially arrived as everyone is trying to take advantage of the warm weather. Who wouldn’t want to spend their days strolling the canals and grabbing a drink at one of the many bars?If you still want to experience the Netherlands in the summer but don’t want big crowds, cities such as Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Hague are noticeably less busy than Amsterdam.August is the time for festivals. Starting with Pride in Amsterdam, there’s also Lowlands (a popular music festival) in Flevoland and Into the Great Wide Open, an alternative art and music festival held on Vlieland Island.  September to OctoberFall is arguably one of the best times to visit the Netherlands. Even though the summer has officially ended, there are still plenty of events going on.For example, in Zundert, a world-renowned flower parade is held. Floats shaped like animals, mythological creatures, and human figures are made of thousands of flowers. Later on in September, Dam to Damloop, a 10-mile road race in Amsterdam is held, attracting thousands of athletes.Music lovers can get their fix at one of the world’s largest EDM festivals, Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE) in October. Venues throughout the city also host club nights, pop-up DJ sessions, and more.   November to FebruaryNovember officially marks the beginning of winter in the Netherlands. The temperature drops considerably however, it’s one of the best times to visit national parks like the Zuid-Kennemerland De Loonse en Druinen.As the temperatures continue to drop in December, everything becomes cozy for Christmas. Christmas markets begin to appear. At the stalls, you’ll find vendors selling speculaas cookies (sooo delicious!) and wooden decorations. If you’re there on December 5th, you can experience Sinterklaasavond, the main gift-giving holiday.During this day, families come together and share presents and plenty of food!January and February are much slower once the holidays are over and locals tend to retreat back indoors. Luckily, if you don’t mind the cold, winter isn’t too harsh in the Netherlands, with temps in the low 40s. Museums also stay open during the time of year, so if you find yourself getting too chilly, you can stay warm in one of the many museums (sans crowds).OverallEvery month in the Netherlands offers a different experience. Whether you’re looking to stroll down the canals of Amsterdam during the summer months or you want to bundle up and enjoy a hot drink at one of the Christmas markets, there truly is no right or wrong time to visit the Netherlands. READ NEXT: The Ultimate Netherlands Travel GuideHave you ever traveled to the Netherlands?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-the-netherlands/,10 Local Foods to Try in the Netherlands,Netherlands,"Move over stroopwafel, there is so much more to Dutch food than the (delicious) treat seen in so many Amsterdam travel photos. The unique cuisine of the Netherlands is rustic and highly influenced by the old colonies, especially Indonesia.Carb lovers will rejoice at the veg-and-cheese-heavy traditional food of the Netherlands. With rich flavors like spiced apples and native cheeses like Gouda and Edam, there is so much to explore…and your tastebuds will thank you!Fun fact: Did you know that the Netherlands actually designed orange carrots? They used to come in all kinds of colors (and still do, don’t worry!) until the Dutch had an idea to honor of the Royal Family…by creating an orange carrot! Yes, it did indeed have significance: it paid tribute to William of Orange. Now ya know!Ready to experience the best dishes from Amsterdam to Utrecht? Here are the top ten local foods to try in the Netherlands.KroketSince creating a Dutch colony there—the Dutch have close ties to Indonesia and its many dishes. Legend has it that the Dutch actually asked the Indonesians to bring over the best recipes from every one of the islands and Kroket is one of those dishes!Kroket is one of the most popular fast food items in Indonesia. A twist on the classic meat and potatoes dish, kroket is ragout and meat stuffed inside of breadcrumbs then deep-fried.Yum!BitterballenSimilar to kroket, or croquette as you might better know them, you will see bitterballen in almost every fast food joint.Commonly serviced with a cold beer, these are typically balls of deep-fried beef served with a side of gravy or thick roux. You will often find these made with beef or veal and a wide range of different sauces. Many places have vegetarian mushroom options—which are absolutely amazing.   HerringNow hear me out—Dutch brined herring, AKA maatjesharing or soused herring, is a typical Dutch snack. If you are going to really wrap your head around Dutch cuisine, you’ve got to try it at least once!Soused herring is usually eaten plain or with just a few cut onions. And, to really eat this the proper “Dutch way” you need to make a bit of a show out of it.So, get an entire herring, and lift it up by its tail then slide it headfirst into your mouth. And keep your camera ready! While you might love it, there is a pretty good chance that this is the last time anyone will see you knocking back Dutch brined herring.PoffertjesNow here is one you will find a lot more palatable than pickled fish! Poffertjes are little pancakes made out of buckwheat. They are light, fluffy, and typically served with powdered sugar and butter or sometimes a syrup.You will also find pannenkoeken widely served.They are quite similar to poffertjes with a few minor differences in preparation. Basically, you can think of poffertjes more like American pancakes while pannenkoeken are more like crêpes (though a little bit thicker). While poffertjes are pretty much always sweet, you will find savory and sweet variations of pannenkoeken.StamppotThere are a ton of variations...but generally, it’ll be a smoked sausage on top of a pile of vegetables. Usually, the veg is sauerkraut, kale, spinach, or turnip greens. When carrot and onion are added, it is then known as hutspot.It is a common hearty winter meal.And, beyond that, it is a bit hard to pin down. You will find things as wacky as pineapple and pear mixed in with the sauerkraut. In that way, it’s a bit like going for pizza in America. There are some standard varieties but you will find an endless array of toppings.HagelslagImagine your eight-year-old self making your own breakfast for the first time and you can get an idea of what hagelslag is.Basically, we are talking about buttered bread coated in chocolate sprinkles. And it’s amazing! You will find it everywhere, even pre-made at the supermarket. If you’ve got a sweet tooth, stock your suitcase.If you think about it—it’s not that much different to how Americans typically coat donuts in sprinkles!   Bami GorengMie goreng, also known as bami goreng or bakmi goreng, is another incredible dish that we can thank Indonesia for. This spicy, fried noodle dish is common in a few parts of Southeast Asia like Malaysia and Singapore (which has some of the best food on the planet, btw!).You will find a few variations but every time we are talking spicy noodle perfection.ErwtensoepThis hearty pea soup is timeless and perfect for a chilly winter day!One of the peak seasons in the Netherlands is from mid-December to early January. It is cold, grey, and rainy but so worth it! As the tourists clear out and get to see authentic Dutch life, you will have to try erwtensoep to keep you warm.AppeltaartThis isn’t your granny’s apple pie (unless nana was Dutch!).While it has the same fundamentals as American apple pie, it’s slightly different. You can find some that are packed full of apples and quite tall, or others that resemble more of a tart slathered in sweet apple goodness.All over the Netherlands, appeltaart is ubiquitous so you will have no trouble finding it!    BonusLet’s talk treats!In addition to my top ten, there are a few fab sweets you must try. Of course, if you have never tried a stroopwafel, you absolutely have to indulge as soon as you arrive. You can find them on the street or practically any grocery store. In fact, you will find these at pretty much any Starbucks across Europe.The trick to eating stroopwafel is to set them on top of your coffee cup (there is a reason they are the perfect shape and size!). Let them get warm, then dip them into your cup for a gooey piece of heaven.If you are lucky enough to be in the Netherlands around Christmas time, keep your eyes peeled for speculaas cookies!While you can find these cookies year-round (and they’re a lovely sweet to have with coffee or tea), they’re especially popular around Christmas.These tasty cookies are filled with festive flavors like nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. Sinterklaasavond is the holiday of St. Nick at the beginning of December. This is the day that Dutch people give gifts and speculaas cookies are the standard present.Ready for your Dutch adventure?

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-la-loma-lodge-in-bocas-del-toro/,Staying at La Loma Lodge in Bocas Del Toro,Panama,"If you’re looking for a vacation that consists of relaxing in the jungle while surrounded by beautiful beaches, then Bocas del Toro should move to the top of your bucket list. One of the most magical accommodation experiences I’ve had to this day was a stay at the La Loma Lodge, a jungle lodge & chocolate farm, on Bastimentos Island.Here is my review of the La Loma Lodge in Bocas Del Toro!  La Loma LodgeHow to Get to La Loma LodgeBocas del Toro is one of the more remote parts of Panama, so I’d recommend booking an extended stay so you can slow down and experience all that the islands have to offer.You can get to Bocas del Toro by bus or plane. Check out my Ultimate Guide to Bocas del Toro for more information on how to get to the islands!Once you’ve arrived in Bocas Town, you’ll need to take a quick water taxi to Bahia Honda on Isla Bastimentos where La Loma is located. Once you’ve made your booking, you’ll get full details on arrival instructions.Read More: The Ultimate Bocas del Toro Travel Guide   About La Loma LodgeLa Loma Lodge is extremely passionate about conservation and preserving the natural environment. They only allow a small number of guests to stay at a time to minimize damage to the surrounding area and the wildlife that calls the land home.The property is only accessible by boat, and it stretches across 23 hectares of tropical forest, groves of cacao, banana and coconut. La Loma is also on the border of the beautiful National Marine Park, and you’re only a five-minute boat ride from the beach.Keep an eye out for the sloths hanging around in the treetops!    The RanchosThere are four ranchos tucked away in the jungle. While they’re referred to as “ranchos,” the rancho I stayed in felt more like an open-air treehouse! Each rancho has a private bathroom with a hot shower, comfortable beds, and furniture crafted on-site from local materials.They use solar panels to provide electricity to the lights and ceiling fans. There is no A/C or television which means you get to enjoy the jungle breeze and the sounds of the wildlife. I woke up to the sounds of birds and monkeys in the morning and was awestruck at the view from my bed!Each rancho features a stunning open-air plan, so you have a full panorama view of the jungle and ocean.Even the showers have a private, yet open view to the jungle!Each morning, you’ll wake to hot coffee or tea delivered to a little box just outside of your rancho door. You can start your morning nice and slow as you take in the view from your balcony as the sun rises (or just after sunrise if you’re a slow starter like me lol).To get to 3 out of the four ranchos, you do have to hike a steep 5-7 minute climb, but the views are worth it! The FoodLa Loma Lodge takes pride in their food. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are included in your stay, and much of what you’ll be eating is grown in their organic garden.I unintentionally planned a stay at La Loma while traveling solo over Valentine’s Day and, also by chance, the remaining ranchos were booked out by other female travelers! So, La Loma planned an amazing dinner for us complete with a chocolate dessert for all three of us to share (and I still dream about it!)The menu is always changing based on local recipes and what foods are in season. If you’re willing to pitch in to help, they love having helpers with harvesting ingredients or fishing for snapper.Read More: Making Organic Chocolate in Bocas del Toro   Activities at La LomaLa Loma Lodge has a few activities included in the price of your stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-visiting-san-blas-in-panama/,Tips for Visiting San Blas in Panama,Panama,"With over 350 islands in the Caribbean Sea, many say that a trip to Panama is not complete without a visit to San Blas (also known as Guna Yala). Rather than boutique hotels and shops, you’ll find simplicity and natural beauty here.San Blas is surrounded by crystal clear water and stretches of sandy beaches, with small huts for shelter. It’s the perfect place to get away from daily stresses and get back in touch with all that nature has to offer.Here are some tips to help when visiting San Blas in Panama!Getting ThereTo get to San Blas, you have four options; you can fly from Panama straight to the islands, take a sailboat from Cartagena, take a speedboat from Capurgana, or take the bus from Panama City. The two most popular options are to travel from Cartagena or Panama. There are over 50 sailboats that will take you to San Blas. If you decide to do this, the average trips last about 5 days (2 days spent sailing).The waters can be extremely rough when sailing due to the wind. You will also spend less time on the islands because of the days of travel. Keep this in mind when booking! Plan out an itinerary and how many days you want to experience the islands.I went for a day trip and felt that my time was too short, so I would recommend at least a 1 or 2-night trip.Know Before You GoSan Blas isn’t your typical vacation spot. Electricity is limited and often times you’ll find that the only light source is the night sky.Be prepared to live off the land. Many of the locals catch fresh food on a daily basis, especially lobster. If you’re one to snorkel, San Blas is the spot for you.Underneath the surface of the water, you’ll find colorful reef and plenty of sea life.When to GoMuch like many other tropical spots, spring and summer are the best seasons to visit. December to March is considered the windy season.This means rocky water and a rocky boat ride between the islands. The islands are surrounded by calm waters due to the reef.From April to November, you’ll experience sunny skies and warm water perfect for swimming.Where to StayThere’s a good chance that the lodging you find is going to be extremely simple as this region is a bit more remote and doesn’t accommodate hoards of tourists (this is a good thing!). Many of the hotels include a bed, a toilet, a sink, and that’s about it.You can find both hotels and Airbnbs for as low as $30 USD a night. Just keep in mind that it might be a simple accommodation experience, so go into it with an open mind.Check Out the Sea StarsAs you explore the islands, you will find starfish everywhere. While they are beautiful, there’s some etiquette to keep in mind when handling them.First and foremost, please wear reef-safe sunscreen. There are tons of chemicals in generic sunscreen, and we want to keep our oceans clean and their critters healthy!Absolutely do NOT lift them out of the water. The ocean is their home. As I’ve gotten more educated on the sensitivities of sea stars, I wish I had not even touched them in the first place. I encourage you to refrain from touching them. However, if you decide to pick one up, please leave it entirely under the sea and put it back exactly where you found it.They’re such delicate creatures and serious damage can be done if you’re not careful.Getting pictures can be tricky so if you are looking to take some like the one I shot above, you’ll need a GoPro and a camera dome. It makes the process easier!OverallIf you’re looking for a vacation spot that’s off the beaten path (we’re talking, not even on Google Maps), then San Blas is the place for you. With crystal clear water, delicious seafood, and a tribe of people who are fiercely passionate about their culture, San Blas is a great travel destination."
https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-visit-panama/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Panama,Panama,"Panama has always been a destination close to my heart since I spent a month living in the island archipelago of Bocas del Toro early on in my 20’s. It was my first backpacking trip to Central America and I ended up getting my PADI scuba certification, surfing and volunteering over that month-long trip.But, I had yet to see the rest of what Panama had to offer!So on my second trip a few years later, I wanted to experience it all! And I learned that there is something for every type of traveler in Panama. Whether you come for world-famous shopping, the pristine islands of San Blas, or for a stroll through the historic Casco Viejo district, you won’t be disappointed.Casco Viejo is definitely my favorite area of Panama City — you’ll find amazing bars, restaurants, and hotels here. It’s the historic district of the city, so you really get a taste of the local culture. Plus, the buildings are incredibly beautiful and colorful.Another highlight of my trip was the Gamboa Rainforest Resort. It felt like an experience straight out of the Jungle Book between paddling on the Chagres River to take an aerial tram ride above the rainforest canopy.And of course, one of the most jaw-dropping destinations in Panama is San Blas. San Blas is an idyllic archipelago made up of 365 islands and cays, and home to thousands of sea stars.If you haven’t visited Panama yet, start planning your trip now!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-panama-city/,Where to Find the Best Food in Panama City,Panama,"Panama is one of those countries that offers an incredible amount of variety and beauty, in a relatively small and easily navigable space.  There are accessible, jaw droppingly beautiful islands in every direction.  There are stretches of jungle that go on for ages, so thick and dense that your eyes get lost in a sea of green.  There is also a city, one rich with history and stories, that is split into a flurry of modern skyscrapers on one end and Casco Viejo on the other, which itself offers quaint streets, quirky bars and stunning architecture.  Panama exceeded my expectations, hands down.  I love cities that are on the way to being “found out” but are not quite there yet.  I love places with an effortless, tropical vibe.  I love countries with residents that live off of locally sourced food, like fish, rice and plantains and sip coconut juice right from the coconuts themselves.  I knew that I’d like it here; I just didn’t realize how much.I spent eight days and eight nights in this Central American gem in Panama City, the San Blas Islands and Bocas del Toro.  Below are some stand outs, focused on food.  There are also incredible bar and lodging options here, some of which were unique and extremely memorable.   You’ll have to head there yourself to see what I mean.  Here are my recommendations for the best food in Panama City!Manolo Caracol Manolo Caracol is interesting, buzzy and creative.  While not a place I’d go running back to, it served as a nice entree into the developing Panamanian dining scene.  It also has a $45 seafood-centric tasting menu with dishes like corn cake with shrimp and mint, and yellowfin with coconut rice and sweet potato; not an offering you’ll easily find in other cities.  GranclementWhen you’re wandering the streets in 90 degree weather with what feels like 100% humidity, French ice creams and sorbets are always a welcome retrieve. Lavender, pistachio, cinnamon are all at your disposal here; get some scoops, get it to go, and keep on exploring those magical streets of Casco Viejo.Fish Market(s) Apparently, as we learned, there are three different places in Panama City named Fish Market.  The reason for this we were not so sure as it did nothing but confuse us, but somehow each option, though very different, were all deserved of a visit.  The first Fish Market we visited were the stands in front of the larger market of Mercado de Mariscos. No frills, no fuss, literally plastic tables set up on the street.  My friend and I ordered the ceviche de pescado for $1.50 that was brought to us in a white styrofoam cup, the grilled fish seabass fillet and a Panama beer. We loved it. The second Fish Market was not a fish market at all, but a Mexican gone Mediterranean joint set up in some open space off of the main road in Casco Viejo. There were food trucks used for cooking and a simple chalkboard menu posted alongside it.  Fish tacos and insanely delicious french fries doused in tzatziki sauce were our food items of choice.  The third Fish Market was inside and upstairs in the Mercado de Mariscos, overlooking the frenzied fish buying stalls below. Here you’ll find red checked tablecloth, a menu stocked with with ceviches (regular and Peruvian style), yuca fries, rices, fillets, lobsters, octopus and everything else you can think of that would fit into this genre.  A fun, casual experience, yet again.MaitoTasting menus are pretty popular in Panama City. The Panamanians seem to have a passion for their history, their culture, as well as their food, and they want you to be able to taste as much of it as you can. Though the tasting menu here was still only a reasonable $55, Maito was actually the highest end dinner we had the whole week. We were able to choose three starters, three entrees, and two desserts for this price, including some beet carpaccio, sea bass ceviche in a pineapple base, and tuna with wasabi and edamame.Las Clementinas BistroLas Clementinas seemed to be the go-to, casual weekend brunch spot for hip, Panama City locals. The walls are adorned in old photographs and what look like newspaper cutouts from over the decades, the floor is tiled in a gray and white geometric art deco design, and the chairs are woven in a bright green and white.  Sunday’s do an official prix-fix brunch menu, Saturday’s and all other days of the week do a lunch that still provides eggs, toasts, and the like.  El Ultimo RefugeIf you’ve ever had an image about what a tropical, beach town restaurant might look like, this is it. Ultimo Refuge is located in Bocas Town, the main area on Isla Colon in Bocas del Toro.  There’s an American transport playing covers you’re likely to know on his guitar, fairy lights strew about the ceiling and beams, and palmtrees placed throughout.  The setting is welcoming and casual, and the food is good.  You’ll find on the menu things like local fish with a light sauce and rice, ceviches, tartares and coconut soups.  This place won’t rock your world but if you need a decent dinner and want to experience that island vibe we all know and love, Ultimo Refuge will hit the spot.  "

https://theblondeabroad.com/making-organic-chocolate-bocas-del-toro/,Making Organic Chocolate in Bocas del Toro,Panama,"The beautiful coastal province of Bocas del Toro in Panama was one of the first areas of Central America to have been visited by European explorers, although it was occupied by indigenous tribes much earlier than the early sixteenth century when it was discovered by Europeans.While Panama may not be among the largest of the world’s chocolate producers, it is certainly developing a reputation as a great producer of high-quality organic chocolate. I took a tour of one of the most interesting chocolate production areas in the country, and I learned that there is a whole lot more to Bocas del Toro than just stunning beaches and great surfing!Waiting at the Almirante boat stop to start the tourThe Cacao Farms Of Bocas Del ToroAt the start of your visit on this tour, one of the first stops is at the farms where the cacao is grown. While much of the area is cultivated, there is also diverse natural life thriving around these farms. Your guide will take you on a walk that alternates between the cacao fields and the jungle that surrounds the area.The range of plant life here is very impressive!There are also plenty of animals that you can often spot around this part of Bocas del Toro, including toucans and red frogs, and your guide will usually point these out for you if they spot them.Cacao fruit growing on treesHighlights of the TourOne of the great aspects of the tour is when the women of the Ngabe tribe take you into their rancho thatched sheds where they treat the cocoa beans in the same way that they have been doing for centuries.The women are all dressed in their traditional cultural dress as they give you the tutorial on how they make the chocolate, and they also serve a traditional meal as a grand finale to the tour. This usually includes elements of the traditional local diet of fresh vegetables and tubers, along with some chicken to complete a tasty meal.Drying the cacao beansMaking Organic Chocolate in Bocas Del ToroFortunately, for those who are taking the tour, you’ll get to make and taste the chocolate!You’ll taste fresh cacao fruit, right off a tree, and taste the cacao in different stages of production. You’ll taste the raw cacao nibs after they’ve been roasted and get the chance to grind the cacao down into chocolate.You’ll get a chance to buy some of the local chocolate before heading back into town as well, so take a few extra dollars (or Panamanian balboas) for this purpose. Chocolate aficionados will find their chocolate to be great value and having a good flavor, while the cacao nibs are my personal favorite for adding to smoothies!Cacao FruitThe Background of Cacao Production in PanamaCacao has long been produced in Panama, and the local traditions include using it as a drink as opposed to the traditional western consumption of chocolate when it is formed into a bar or sweets. The Kuna people are a tribe that are found in several areas of the country, and they are known to drink around five cups of chocolate every day.The plant also serves another role in some parts of the country, as the beans are burnt as an incense by local shamans, and the smoke of these beans are also used as a herbal remedy for many conditions.An Overview of the Ngabe PeopleIn the Ngabe language, the people of this indigenous group simply call themselves ‘Guaymi’, which is their word for people, and they are traditionally a group that have survived through agriculture, hunting and fishing around the coastal areas of Panama.Most of the men usually wear western clothes now, but the women still commonly wear the traditional long gowns that have bright bands of different colors.Originally the indigenous group would have been found in some of the best land in Panama, but after repeated conflicts with colonial powers, over the centuries they have become a group that is usually found in the highland areas where the growing conditions are ideal for chocolate, but not so favorable for many other crops.Tour: Cacao Plantation TourCompany: Habla Ya PanamaCost: $35Special thanks to Habla Ya for hosting me on the Oreba Chocolate Plantation Tour. As always, the content & opinions expressed here are entirely my own."

(Glamping: Glamorous camping) Anyways… I didn’t check into Palmar until sunset, but I was excited to be spending my very first night in Bocas at Palmar.I would be staying in my very own beachfront safari tent surrounded by the serenity of the jungle. My digs in the jungleI spent my days soaking up the sun on the beautiful Red Frog Beach and enjoying the company of the incredible Palmar staff. In the evenings, I savoured delicious home-cooked & family-style dinners in the communal lodge.And, each night, tropical rain danced on the canvas of my tent and the nearby rush of the ocean waves lulled me to sleep.Plan Your Stay at Palmar Beach LodgeCost of Accommodation: One of my favorite things about Palmar is they have accommodation to suit every budget. From dorm-style tents to luxury family-sized tents, there really is something for everyone. You can even pitch your own tent. You really can’t beat the location or the price!Great value accommodation ranging from $10-70 USD.How to Get There: While most tourism is based in Bocas Town on Isla Colon, Palmar is located on the nearby island of Isla Bastimentos. For that reason, you’ll enjoy the seclusion of the lodge while still remaining within a short boat ride of the main island. Boat transportation is offered to and from Palmar from Casa Verde Hostel & Guest House in Bocas Town.$4 each way or $7 round trip. Boats leave Casa Verde at 9:45 am & 4:30 pm and return at 10:15 am and 5 pm.Dining: The communal lodge has a full kitchen for your use. You can do your shopping in Bocas Town before heading to Palmar and cook your own food during your stay. As a frequent traveler, I absolutely love when kitchens are available. It helps me keep my costs down on food when most of the time I’m forced to eat at restaurants.Most nights, family-style dinners are also offered ($6-7 per person) and every Saturday there is a fun pizza party. They bake Earth Oven pizzas right on the beach and you can order all sorts of delicious toppings for your own pizza. ($7 + toppings)**Note: Breakfast and lunch are not offered so plan to bring your own food ahead of time. There is a bar for snacks and beverages open all day and through dinner hours.**Amenities: Boogie boards and snorkel gear are available and free for guests to use. There are also surfboards available for rent. Beach chairs and shaded hammocks are also around for guests to enjoy.There’s no WiFi at Palmar, but just a 10-minute walk away is Bocas Bound hostel where you can get the internet. Also, while he’s not necessarily an amenity, be sure to say “Hi” to Bob! (Just don’t lend him any of your fingers. He might not give them back.)Additional Information: This is an eco-friendly lodge, which means you will feel very close to nature. There is limited solar lighting in the evenings. The bathrooms are communal but kept very clean and are centrally located. The showers use rain water and are cold and can be short on water. And bugs will happen.

Diving in the Red Sea in Jordan and snorkeling in The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia were life-changing. In Bocas del Toro, Panama, I decided to get PADI Open Water Diver Certified with the 5-Star rated La Buga Dive Center and Surf School.While I have come to love diving, it wasn’t always something I wanted to do.As with many things I do while traveling, I like to try new things and especially things that scare me. One of those things being diving. I am absolutely terrified of the open ocean. I have a seriously over-active imagination. I picture myself jumping into the water and coming face-to-face with a Great White shark or some other large aquatic animal. I even had the same fear about pools as a child. (As if a shark would be in the deep end of a community pool.)No matter what, it still crosses my mind every time I jump off a boat into the middle of the ocean. So, to conquer my fears, I’ve put my passion into diving. Each time I go, it gets a little easier. The underwater world is anything but scary. It’s breathtaking.Here’s my experience scuba diving in Bocas del Toro!All of these shots were taken during my PADI Open Water Diver course. I dived at the four sites over the course of two days. As you can see, it was incredible!Dive Location – The Wreck“In 12 meter/ 40 ft depth you will find a beautiful ship wreck, which was intentionally sunk there 11 years ago. In the course of time the old ferry became part of the natural environment and is shelter for countless big and small fish and other reef inhabitants.” – La Buga Dive CenterDive Location – Mangrove Point“At Mangrove Point you will find a lovely shallow reef, which is suitable for both, beginners as well as experienced divers. If you are keen on underwater photography, this is the place to go, since there is no current at all. It is also a fantastic place for night diving, where you will explore the underwater world from a totally different perspective.” – La Buga Dive CenterDive Location – Casa Blanca (White House)“Located in front of the island Solarte, White House is one of the deepest spots in the area. Therefore, this site offers two dive options: It is the perfect place to go deep diving, for example for your Advanced Open Water experience and also provides a shallower area with a very interesting underwater typography, lots of coral and many schools of fish.” – La Buga Dive CenterDive Location- Casa Verde (Green House)“Green House and Coral Garden stretches along the same seemingly never ending reef as White House. In this area, you can spot large schools of fish, big rays and smaller ocean dwellers hiding between the colorful sponges and corals.” – La Buga Dive Center"
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-first-48-hours-bocas-del-toro/,The First 48 Hours: Bocas del Toro,Panama,"I arrived in Bocas del Toro after a 6-hour direct flight from Los Angeles to Panama City, a five hour layover in Panama City, a ten hour bus ride from Panama City to Bocas and a thirty minute boat ride to Isla Colon. I was absolutely exhausted as I watched the sun rise from the boat through my squinted eyes. I have officially traveled to my 28th country.The familiar craze and bustle of Latin America is nowhere to be found here in Bocas del Toro. Even with the upcoming Carnaval weekend, all the shops slowly flipped over their “closed signs” for tourists around 11 am. I am all about island life, but it’s really hard for me to unwind, disconnect and sloooowww down. Although,I’m sure I’ll find a way to adjust.My friend and the founder of Give and Surf, Neil, walked to meet me at my boat stop on the main drag of the island. His first words,“Are you up for an adventure?”I hadn’t slept in nearly 48 hours but couldn’t pass up my first opportunity for fun in Bocas. We met up with Neil’s friend Justin, hopped on a boat and began in the direction of Bluff Beach. I still didn’t really know what I was getting myself into until we anchored about 200 meters from shore.I had to swim to the island through a huge surf break.I swallowed my fear as I put my beach towel into my dry bag, threw a surfboard into the water and jumped off the boat. I watched as the huge waves crashed onto the shore and my life flashed before my eyes.Ok, that’s a bit dramatic. But I was scared.Neil told me to swim to where the waves were just beginning to form and jump off the board. He would grab the board and I would swim to shore. A seemingly simple task turned into a near-drowning of yours truly. I’ll spare the details but Neil ended up dragging me to shore. I passed out on the beach face first into my towel and woke up a couple hours later to see the boys still out surfing and giggling like little school girls.Then, I had to swim back.We got back safely to the island (a little saltier than when I first arrived) and went to Bocas Blended for some fresh made smoothies. Bocas Blended is this awesome little bus converted into a kitchen with a rooftop dining area.You may have noticed I still haven’t actually checked into any sort of accommodation yet.Enter: Palmar Tent Lodge. We took the boat to another island called Isla Bastimentos. (Lots of boat rides here!) I will be staying in a jungle tent right on the beach at the Palmar Tent Lodge for the next three nights. It’s luxury camping in the coolest location ever.This weekend is Carnaval so I’ll be heading back to Bocas tomorrow to partake in the festivities. For now, it’s just me and the beach.More updates soon!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/finding-purpose-in-panama/,Finding Purpose in Panama,Panama,"I’m excited to make my first travel announcement of 2013:I’m going to Panama!Bocas del Toro, Panama is a popular tourist destination famed for its natural beauty and great surf, which is part of the reason I have decided to pay this destination a visit.So why Panama? What influences me to decide where to go next?I was recently introduced to an organization called Give and Surf that is based in the Bocas del Toro region. Give and Surf is dedicated to empowering the indigenous people of Bahia Honda through education and community development.“Our world of giving to the community comes in form of a Monso Chi Escuelita (a preschool of twenty 3-5 year olds), adult ESL classes, summer camp, after school program, sustainable chicken egg project, Bahia Honda baseball team, and many community development and construction projects.”After getting in touch with the founder of the organization, Neil, I knew I had to get involved. Neil’s passion for making a positive impact on the Bocas region inspired him to leave his career in San Diego and move to a remote area of Panama.My journey in Panama will commence in just one short month. I plan on spending three weeks in Bocas del Toro exploring the region and learning more about the impact that Give and Surf has had on the community.Along with helping out at the preschool and the other projects that Give and Surf is working on, you can bet I’ll be doing plenty of snorkeling and surfing. I also can’t wait to get myself a proper Panama hat!So, while sometimes it’s the call of adventure or the thrill of the unknown that stimulates my interest, it’s always my heart that sweeps me off to foreign lands. I feel a great personal responsibility to the world which has given me so much.Surf, sunshine and smiles here I come!For more information on the positive changes happening in Bocas del Toro, visit Give and Surf’s website."
https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-spend-48-hours-in-cusco/,How to Spend 48 Hours in Cusco,Peru,"Cusco is one of my favorite cities in South America! It’s home to delicious food, a fascinating history, herds of adorable alpacas and a whole lot of adventure.I first traveled to Cusco in 2013 as part of my volunteering trip with Peruvian Hearts. We raised over $5,500 for the charity, and all our fundraising efforts went towards the education of 13 young girls.In between exploring the city, we hiked the Inca Trail, I spent Christmas with a local family and got to see Cusco through the eyes of the locals.Here’s how to spend 48 hours in Cusco!   Getting to CuscoYou can get to Cusco by bus, train or plane. The Alejandro Velasco Astete International Airport is a small airport that only receives international flights from La Paz, Bolivia.If you’re flying in, it’s best to land in Lima and take a connecting domestic flight to the city.But if you have the time and want to save money, take the local bus or train. The bus routes run all over the country and are a great way to travel like a local if you don’t mind sitting for long periods.For something more luxurious, take the first-class train ride into Cusco from Puno. The service only runs a couple of days a week, and the journey takes around 10 hours.Read More: The Ultimate Peru Travel Guide    Where to Stay in CuscoBelmond HotelsIf you’re looking for a super luxury stay in Cusco, check into the Belmond Monasterio or the Belmond Palacio. Both properties are five-star hotels and are excellent options if you’re looking for some pampering while in Peru. Besides their uber-luxe accommodation, Belmond also operates a luxury train to take guests from Cusco to Aguas Calientes to visit Machu Picchu.  If you’re planning on staying in the area for a night or two, check out their hotel Belmond Sanctuary Lodge.Samana Inn & SpaIf you’re looking for an upscale and romantic experience in Cusco, the Samana Inn and Spa is truly magical. With floor to ceiling windows in the bedrooms, you’ll have a stunning view of the mountains in the distance.;Hotel Cusi WasiWith rooms starting at $50 a night, Hotel Cusi Wasi is an affordable option for travelers that are looking for an excellent mid-range option. Included in your nightly rate is a private room with hot water, a delicious breakfast, free pickup from the airport and as much coca tea as you want.   Market in CuscoDay 1Have Breakfast at San Pedro Market Shopping at the San Pedro Market is an excellent place to try authentic Peruvian food. Located only 10-minutes from the Plaza de Armas (the city’s main square), you can spend an hour or two wandering around and sampling all the delicious meals for sale.Don’t forget to pick up some quinoa, Camu Camu (a cherry-like fruit), and maca (a pungent root). Whatever you do, make sure you try to haggle! Prices are always negotiable.Book a Tour at the Choco MuseumPeru ranks in the top 10 largest cacao producers in the world. If you’re a chocolate addict like me, you don’t want to miss out on a tour of the Choco Museum!You can book a mini chocolate workshop and learn how to turn a bean into a bar of chocolate. Other options include attending a cooking class, going on a plantation tour or a chocolate, coffee, Pisco and beer tasting.Grab Lunch at Plaza de Armas Plaza de Armas is the main square of Cusco and is the top tourist attraction in the city. It’s an excellent spot for foodies who want to enjoy a traditional Peruvian meal.Grab something to eat on the go and wander past the city’s ancient Cusco Cathedral and the Church La Compañía de Jesús.   Go to the Ccohahuasi Animal Sanctuary If you love animals as much as me, you’ll want to make your way to the Ccohahuasi Animal Sanctuary! It’s situated 30-minutes outside of the city and is a privately-owned organization in Sacred Valley that rescues exotic animals that have been injured or used for cruel entertainment purposes.The best way to get to the sanctuary is to take a private taxi from Cusco. However, if you’re on a budget, you can hop on board a shared bus from the city.Just be sure to tell the driver where you’re going, and they’ll let you know when to get off!Head Back to the HotelThough time is limited, with the altitude and the time difference, there’s a good chance that you won’t be feeling up to a hectic day. After watching the sunset, head back to your hotel to relax.You’ll want to get up early to soak up the last of your time in Cusco. Day 2Grab a Light Breakfast at La ValerianaLa Valeriana is famous for its coffee and pastries. If you like sweets, try their tiramisu coffee cake or try their delicious empanadas!Explore San BlasLocated northeast of Plaza de Armas, this bohemian and artistic neighborhood is much quieter than the city center. The district is made up of museums, eateries, and artisans.It’s a great spot to pick up some souvenirs and grab a bite to eat!Dinner at Mr. SoupIt may sound silly, but this soup restaurant is one of the most famous in Cusco. They have a wide variety of soups, from traditional Peruvian broths to Italian to Thai.If you’re looking for something a bit more formal to enjoy before the big send-off, Inkazuela is another tasty option.    Day Trips from CuscoSacsayhuamanSacsayhuaman is an ancient Incan complex that’s a short 15-minute drive from Cusco. The walls of the ruins fit together so well that you can’t fit a single piece of paper between some of them.Humantay LakeIf you’re an avid hiker, don’t miss out on a day trip to Humantay Lake. It’s a four-drive from Cusco, and there’s a beautiful Salkantay hiking trail that will take you past the lakes impressive turquoise water.Rainbow MountainRainbow Mountain is one of the most popular day trips from Cusco. Located three hours away from Cusco, you can sign up for a tour or hire a car and drive yourself. The hiking trail winds past the colorful mountain, and if you have more time, you can attempt the six-day Ausangate Trek.Machu PicchuBelieve it or not, but you can visit Machu Picchu as a day trip from Cusco. How? You can sign up for a tour, or you can take the train from Cusco to the Aguas Calientes station. From there, you can catch a bus to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Machu Picchu.I’d highly recommend planning in advance and hiking the Inca Trail, or at the very least, spend the night in Aguas Calientes so you can take your time at the ruins.Read More: How to Prepare for Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu OverallCusco is worth spending a couple of days exploring and shouldn’t be overshadowed by Machu Picchu or Rainbow Mountain. If you have the time in your itinerary, I highly recommend taking the time to explore the markets, see the animals, and eat as much chocolate as possible!Read More: The Best Time to Hike the Inca Trail and Visit Machu Picchu Do you have any tips for visiting Cusco?

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-prepare-for-hiking-the-inca-trail-to-machu-picchu/,How to Prepare for Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu,Peru,"Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu was one of the hardest and most rewarding things I’ve ever done. While you don’t need to train like you would for a marathon, the Inca Trail still requires preparation.It’s a four-day physical journey that will test your mental and physical limits.Here is what you need to know to prepare for hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu! Before you LeaveBook with a Travel Company: The Peruvian government requires that a professional guide accompanies all hikers. Only 500 people are allowed on the Inca Trail per day, so make sure you organize your permit and private guide or book a tour in advance.Physical Prep: The Inca Trail is no joke and even those who are reasonably fit may find themselves short of breath on the trek. I highly recommend, at the very least, hiking before your trip with the gear you’ll carry on the Inca Trail. It’s a great way to make sure you only pack what you can handle. If you want to get in better shape before the trek, cardio is a great way to increase your endurance, and weight training will strengthen your upper body and legs.Mental Prep: Preparing your mind is just as important as preparing your body. There are parts of the hike that will feel easy and others that will have you questioning your ability to finish the trail. You need to push through those hard moments and keep your motivation in mind to help you reach your final destination.Read More: The Best Time to Hike the Inca Trail and Visit Machu Picchu    What to PackThe key to packing for the Inca Trail is essentialism. You only want to take what you need to finish the hike. If you pack too much, your bag will weigh you down and put extra weight on your body.Pack Layers: It’s important to keep in mind that the temperature changes. In the evening, you’ll need warmer layers, but the days heat up fast. Make sure you pack enough layers, as well as a hat and gloves to keep your body insulated.Boots and Sandals: I’d also recommend bringing along two pairs of shoes: waterproof hiking boots and sandals.Extras: Other useful things to pack are a hydration pack, bug spray, sun protection, a headlamp, moleskin (for blisters) and medication for altitude sickness. Hiring a PorterIf you’re unsure of your ability to hike the trail, you might consider hiring a porter to carry your gear. I hired a porter to carry my extra clothes and toiletries and personally only carried a hydration pack and camera. The hike was really tough for me– even without carrying much.The porters run ahead of your group to set up your camp and prepare meals. So, you want to make sure you have everything you need for the long day. But, anything you don’t need while hiking can go with a porter.   Machu PicchuAfter You ArriveAcclimate in Cusco: Before you start the Inca Trail, you need to prepare your body for the high altitude. Spend a few days in Cusco, and you’ll reduce the risk of getting altitude sickness and having to turn back. You can even hike around the area as practice and explore places like Colca Canyon.Pace Yourself: Hiking the Inca Trail is not a race. Go slow and take your time adjusting to the altitude and taking in the scenery.Stay Hydrated: One of the best ways to prevent altitude sickness is to stay hydrated. Make sure you’re drinking enough water every day, even if you don’t feel like it. Another item that’s useful to pack is salt tablets. It will help you replace what your body is sweating out.Eat Enough Food: The higher you climb, the slower your digestion becomes. While you’re hiking, you might find that you’ve lost your appetite. However, it’s super important that you continue to eat and have snacks that you can munch on throughout the day. If you’re not consuming enough calories to replace the ones you’re burning, you won’t have the energy and stamina to finish the trek.Pack Your Passport: Once you arrive at the gates of Machu Picchu, you can get your passport stamped as a souvenir!Read More: What to Expect on The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu Do you have any tips for preparing to hike the Inca Trail?

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-time-to-hike-the-inca-trail-and-visit-machu-picchu/,The Best Time to Hike the Inca Trail and Visit Machu Picchu,Peru,"Machu Picchu is one of the most picturesque places on Earth!It’s one of the most visited UNESCO sites– with one million people visiting Machu Picchu every year! UNESCO sites are popular for a reason, so I often find that they’re overcrowded and have taken on damage from mass tourism. But not Machu Picchu!One of the best things about the ruins is that tourism is closely monitored and the number of visitors is restricted to enforce to preserve this archeological wonder.That being said, picking the right time of year to visit is very important! Weather and crowds can impact your experience and how difficult you’ll find hiking Inca Trail.Here is my guide on the best time to hike the Inca Trail and visit Machu Picchu! Visiting Machu PicchuBefore we get into the Inca Trail, I know that the hike isn’t for everyone. It’s arduous and takes a few days to complete! If you’re short on time or aren’t interested in making the multi-day trek, here are some helpful tips for visiting Machu Picchu!Personal RecommendationsI would recommend an overnight stay in Aquas Calientes (the town located a few miles from the site). It takes a few hours to get here from Cusco, so you can plan a slow day of travel to get there, then stay overnight and get to Machu Picchu for sunrise the following morning.Where to StayI trekked the Inca Trail nearly 10 years ago as a backpacker, so I didn’t have luxury hotels on my radar. The Belmond Sanctuary Lodge is now at the top of my bucket list! Splurge on a comfortable stay here and take their luxury train to and from Cusco to get there!Ticket PricesTicket prices for Machu Picchu range from $37 – $62 per person and only 2,500 spaces are allocated each day for access to the site.If you want to visit Huayna Picchu as well (it’s a tough hike with rewarding views!), there are 200 spots available per day, and it costs $71. Tickets for Machu Picchu Mountain cost $67, and there is a daily restriction of 400 people.Getting To and FromYou don’t need to trek into Machu Picchu! The easiest way to get to from Cusco to Machu Picchu is to take the train to Aguas Calientes (the town located a few miles from the site). It’s a scenic 3.5-hour trip each along the Urubamba River in the Sacred Valley.There are a few trains that operate. I hiked the trail to get to Machu Picchu and took the Peru Rail train back to Cusco. If I were to do the trip over, I’d travel (at least one-way) on the 1920s-inspired luxury train, the Belmond Hiram Bingham. I am obsessed with luxury train travel!Helpful Tip: Book as far in advance as possible! You’ll notice a theme with all things Machu Picchu– it sells out! If train tickets from Cusco are sold out, don’t panic. Try to buy a ticket to Aguas Calientes that departs from the town of Ollantaytambo in the Sacred Valley.Ollantaytambo is worth a visit in itself, so you could also spend a night there. It’s easy to get taxis and minivans between Ollantaytambo and Cusco and the journey is around 1 hour.Read More: How to Prepare for Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu Hiking the Inca TrailFor those planning to hike to Machu Picchu via the Inca Trail, I salute you! I made the trek in 2011 (before this blog was even a thought!) and it was one of the best experiences in all my travels.I’ll break down the best time to plan your visit below, but keep in mind that the trail is closed for repairs for the entire month of February! You can still visit Machu Picchu, but you won’t be able to hike the trail.Also, keep in mind that only 500 permits are allowed on the trail per day. Some seasons are busier than others, so be sure to book your trip well in advance! You can check the availability of Inca Trail permits or book a tour (that includes permits) in advance.Check out my breakdown of What to Expect on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu! Hiking the Inca Trail in Winter (June-August)June to August is Peru’s dry season. It’s one of the best times to visit Machu Picchu because the weather is as close to perfect as it gets. You’ll have blue skies and less rain and fog blocking your view.During the winter months, days are warm, nights are cool, and rain is sparse. June, July, and August are considered the best months to visit “weather-wise”, but with great weather comes large crowds. Remember that the Inca Trail is restricted to 500 permits per day, however, Machu Picchu allows 2,500!If you want to hike the Inca trail during the winter season, you’ll need to book your trip well in advance as permits sell out (sometimes a year in advance)! Hiking the Inca Trail in Spring (September-November)Spring is another excellent time of year to trek the Inca Trail. The weather is still mostly dry, temperatures are pleasant, and the crowds of tourists have mostly cleared.The seasonal calm means you’re also more likely to find a good deal on tours. This time of year is perfect for travelers that want to experience the ruins with fewer people.Read More: Journey to the Lost City and Last Refuge of the Incas Hiking the Inca Trail in Summer (December-February)From December to February, Machu Picchu experiences its annual rainfall. While the temperatures are still warm, the weather can be thick with fog, and rain is unpredictable and can come in downpours.With rain getting heavier as the months go on, fewer people attempt the Inca trail during this period. While you can still make the trek, it’s important to keep in mind that the trail will be muddy and some dangers, like flash floods and landslides, are a real possibility.I personally hiked the Inca Trail in mid-December. Not because I planned for the best weather, but because I was spending Christmas in Cusco. We experienced some rain and cold nights. But, nothing that inhibited our experience. I really enjoyed the way the fog created a moody landscape and I prefer hiking in cooler temperatures!Don’t forget– the Inca Trail is closed all of February!Read More: How to Spend 48 Hours in Cusco Hiking the Inca Trail in Fall (March-May)As the rainy season comes to an end, fall is another great time of year to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. The skies begin to clear and the heavy tourist season hasn’t quite hit.One of the best reasons to hike the Inca Trail during this season is that everything comes into bloom! After the summer rains, the mountains are blanketed in shades of green, and you’ll spot tons of flowers and orchids blooming along the trail.The ruins are even more beautiful with gloomy skies and a blanket of mist!Inca Trail Permits Sold Out During Your Visit?Don’t worry! There are countless ways to visit Machu Picchu, and the Inca Trail is only 1 of the hikes to get there– it’s just the most famous! If you’re adamant on hiking there, do some research on the Lares Trek to see if it’s right for you!– Important Dates to Keep in Mind –During school holidays, more families make their way to Machu Picchu. A lot of Inca Trail permits and tours are booked solid, so if you’re planning to travel during these periods, make sure you organize your tour or buy your permits months (or even a year) in advance:ThanksgivingChristmasSpring BreakSummer Break OverallOverall, April through October is the best time to visit Machu Picchu. However, there’s no bad time to trek the Inca Trail (except February — when it’s closed!) Is hiking the Inca Trail on your bucket list? Let me know in the comments!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-lima/,Where to Find the Best Food in Lima,Peru,"This NYC Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!In 2012, when I was 30 years old, I took an eight-month hiatus from work.  For six of these months, I was on the road, making stops in places like Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay and more.  There were so many highlights during this unforgettable journey, but one in particular really caught me by surprise.   In the early portion of my travels, which began in South America, several people had enthusiastically encouraged me to alter my plans to include Lima.  They said this city was the ultimate food capital of not just Peru, but of all of the continent and maybe the world.  Here’s where to find the best food in Lima!El MercadoEl Mercado is a buzzing Sunday lunch spot, open daytime only. I loved it the moment I walked in; there’s a powerful, energetic vibe that is gripping.  I made fast friends with the chefs and was given a sizzling plate of grilled scallops served in open seashells on the house to start me off.  Followed by that was the causa, a Peruvian specialty, and the original hot and cold ceviche, a two-textured dish of fried calamari and tuna. I also went back here at the end of my Lima trip for some white wine and the churros, served with three sides; vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce, and dulce de leche sauce.  Sold yet?Pescados CapitalesPescados Capitales is housed in a sprawling space that is half indoors, half outdoors, that is a more formal feel than El Mercado, but still with an air of excitement and fun. I started with the crispy grilled calamari and finished with the tuna ceviche with corn, sweet potato, and salad.  I remember feeling palpable happiness as I worked my way through each dish, feeling that I was literally tasting greatness. This remains one of the more memorable meals I have ever had in life, and it takes a lot for statements like that to be made.  Canta RanaCanta Rana is a very local feeling, very hidden and very casual spot in the Barranco district. It has a more old school feel than anywhere else I tried, with flags of different countries and mismatched old photos hung on the walls.  I had the parmesan soaked scallops to start and the polpo ceviche as the main.Do you have any recommendations for restaurants in Lima?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/cusco-christmas-eve/,A Very Cusconian Christmas Eve,Peru,"At the Christmas MarketsIt’s Christmas Eve and my friend Lindsay and I decided to get fancy and stay in a hostel in town for the night. We found the coolest hostel I’ve ever been to called Pariwana.It’s like the love child of Hogwarts and a hostel!There is a courtyard full of beanbags, a study with a ceiling that is lit up with the constellations of the night sky, a mess hall full of people from all walks of life enjoying great food and making new friends, and even a bar turned nightclub!People from all over are visiting Cusco for the holidays and we met some sweet English girls and a fellow American travel blogger, Gareth, who we shared breakfast with this morning.Visions of Panetón danced in our heads!We have been staying with a host family in the outskirts of town so, while we love staying there, we are spoiling ourselves by staying close to the main plaza .Hot water and WiFi! Yay!We got all of our last minute trinket shopping out of the way and spent the day browsing the Christmas markets in Plaza de las Armas. Little shops line the plaza selling everything from Christmas treats to Alpaca fur hats.They also cater to shark and Santa balloon enthusiasts.The busy streets of CuscoWe also decided to get a bit of pampering in. We returned from four days of hiking the Inca Trail yesterday and decided to get massages to day.Best. Idea. Ever.After our massages we picked up a couple of Panetóns (traditional sweet Christmas bread) and went back to the main plaza. We browsed the night market which was bustling with last minute shoppers and children enjoying sweets and treats. I even picked up a little fluffy deliciousness myself.Our next stop was at the Cusco Casino to test our luck.Yes. There’s a casino in Cusco.We spent about 5 minutes gambling at the slots before our luck ran dry. Better luck next time!Not so “Stinkin Rich”Traditionally, Cusconians serve chicken soup at 11 pm and wait for Papa Noel who comes a midnight. We went back to our host family’s home for the traditional meal of soup and midnight fireworks to celebrate. We brought our gift of Panetón for the family and shared the fruit-filled bread for dessert.Colorful PanetónA very Cusconian Christmas Eve indeed!At midnight, we made our way to the rooftop of the house and lit sparklers and set off firecrackers as we watched the entire city explode in lights and celebration. It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. The whole city was bursting with fireworks and you could hear the celebration below stretch for miles. I’ll never forget the feeling. The true spirit of Christmas is all around me!¡Feliz Navidad!Fireworks at midnight!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/last-refuge-incas/,Journey to the Lost City and Last Refuge of the Incas,Peru,"I have always planned out my own travels, hired tour guides when needed, or taken a guided tour when recommended. This is my recount of a “tour” that wasn’t.I was staying with a host family in Cusco with my friend Lindsay. Our host, Daniel, suggested that we take a 3-day tour to the Last Refuge of the Incas with him. We were 100% on board considering there are no tours that go to Vilcabamba or Quillabamba and it was a great opportunity to go with a Peruvian host.A map of our routeUnfortunately, the price of $250 each left us feeling like we could have done more for much less money and in less time.Sometimes the price we pay for not knowing better when visiting other countries!Day 1: QuillabambaWe got an early start to drive from Cusco to Quillabamba and ended up spending 6 hours in a car with an absolutely crazy driver! Our first setback was when we got stuck behind a rock slide for 20 minutes. Little did we know this would become the recurring theme of this trip!Most near death experiences in a single car ride- check!Always be sure to pack a roadie!When we arrived in Quillabamba we checked into our hotel and had lunch at the restaurant of a friend of our host and guide, Daniel. My newest favorite Peruvian dish- Palta Rellena (an avocado filled with a type of potato salad).Heaven on a ceramic plateAfterwards, we drove up the mountainside and visited Daniel’s childhood home and plantation where they grew everything from coffee & cacao to mangos & passion fruit. We shared our ride back down the mountain with 5 Peruvian men… I’ve come to find this a standard operation here in Peru.Four in the backseat and one or more in the trunk… it’s cool.Quillabamba is a quaint little town with absolutely no tourists. It’s beautiful, small & tropical and is easily walkable. Even after the sunset the weather stayed warm. Just like summer nights back home.*Insert nostalgic moment here*We walked around town to the Plaza de las Armas and local market and then to an unexpected surprise stop… a local school prom! Daniel’s friend owned a warehouse space that they had rented out to host a school’s prom for the evening. Lindsay and I were cordially invited!Only one problem- what to wear?In the states, we take prom very seriously. And we would treat a Peruvian prom with no less respect. We happened to find a store across the street from our hotel that was renting prom dresses.FATE.Lindsay dawned a stunning purple number while I proudly displayed a lovely pink one-of-a-kind piece. We surprised everyone at the dance as we performed a perfectly reenacted “Romy and Michele” routine. I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time.Yes. Yes we did.We had to return our dresses by 10 pm or else we would turn into pumpkins. So, after we changed (and gathered what was left of our pride), we went back to the same spot we ate lunch at for dinner to meet our guide, Daniel.Only this time, we were crashing a company Christmas dinner party!We enjoyed fresh fish with potatoes and salad. I was completely floored by the level of deliciousness of this restaurant! And for only $7.50! After dinner, we went back to hotel to pass out. (We were still catching up on sleep from our trek to Machu Picchu just two days earlier.)Day 2: VilcabambaIt was Summer Solstice and we were SO excited to get to visit an Incan archaeological site on this special day! We got another early start at 7 am to drive to Vilcabamba. Normally it’s only supposed to take a couple of hours to drive there but because it’s rainy season we ran into a few obstacles.Luckily, we didn’t have another crazy driver. We got to a point in the road where a landslide took out a massive part of the road and construction crews were there building a bridge. Our car had to turnaround because it couldn’t cross the road and we had to grab all of our things and literally “walk the plank” across a janky bridge.Watch out for that landslide!I’m not a fan of heights and this wasn’t my idea of a good time.I put one foot in front of the other staring down to the rocky river 150 ft below me until I reached the other side. After the extreme makeshift bridge crossing, we found ourselves without a car in the rain. We were invited to the porch of a family’s home where we shared a laugh with a man that was absolutely wasted drunk… and it was only 11 am.After waiting a substantial amount of time, we finally found a ride and made the rest of our journey to Vilcabamba. After hours upon hours of driving on winding and bumpy dirt roads, we finally arrived, both Lindsay and I sick to our stomachs.Fresh air after HOURS of driving on windy muddy roadsWe laid down in the grass at our hotel (family home) before getting our groove back and gearing up for our three hour tour of the ruins of the last refuge of the Incas. The hike took us to three different archeological sites. At our first stop, we performed a coca leaf offering with Daniel while he played the Andean flute.The ruins were surrounded by beautiful flowers and wild strawberries. We could’ve stayed there all day. The last site had a huge boulder that looked as though it was moved there and placed on top of hand carved stones. Like other famous Inca sites, very little is known about the purpose of the stone constructions.It was a perfect last stop to explore the ancient Inca ruins.The Lost City and Last Refuge of the Incas#1 Lesson with ALL travel!Take everything in stride and stay positive! Even in frustrating situations, keeping your cool and making the best of the situation can turn everything around. Sometimes the unplanned things end up being better than the original plan. While we didn’t plan on paying to go to prom on our tour, it is one of my favorite memories of Peru!Advice for Visiting Quillabamba and VilcabambaRegarding the tour, you can obviously see, that with the exception of high school prom, all of this is feasible to do on your own with a little advance planning. Aside from the hike to the archaeological site in Vilcabamba, there wasn’t exactly a tour.My advice would be to arrange transportation ahead of time out of Cusco and simply go to Vilcabamba in a single day.You’ll save two days of dangerous driving and your wallet will thank you. Also, there are times of the year when you simply SHOULDN’T be driving to Quillabamba or Vilcabamba (which I think we found ourselves dealing with). Ultimately, avoid going during the rainy season.Otherwise, I think that visiting Vilcabamba, the Lost City and the last refuge of the Incas, is definitely worth a visit! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/inca-trail-to-machu-picchu-peru/,What to Expect on The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu,Peru,"It took us four days of trekking the Inca Trail to finally reach Machu Picchu. It was one of the most incredible and challenging experiences of my life.Not sure when to plan your trip? Be sure to read my guide on The Best Time to Hike the Inca Trail!Here’s a breakdown of each day on the Inca Trail leading up to our final destination… Machu Picchu!  Kilometer 82UPDATE: I hiked the Inca Tail in 2011 and hired a guide company from Cusco. I honestly don’t even know what the company was. Nowadays, you should get your Inca Trail permit and book your guide or tour MONTHS in advance. Only 500 people are allowed on the trail daily, so space is limited.Inca Trail Day 1: “No Problemo”6:30 am wake up call and all ready for our first day on the Inca Trail! After breakfast in Urubamba, our host, Edwin, walked us to the bus stop to catch our bus to kilometer 82 of the Inca Trail.On the bus, we met Juana and Pepe, our guides, and the rest of our group who we would be spending the next four days with. I had butterflies the entire drive there.I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into. All I had heard about the Inca Trail was that it was going to be physically challenging and one of the most incredible experiences of my life. (A bit of a broad description if you ask me!)We strapped on our packs, grabbed our walking sticks, crossed over the river, and began the trek. Our first stop was at the halfway point, Canabamba.Juana showed us these local bugs that live in the cactus, or “tuna” in the native language Quechua. When you squish them, their “blood” produces a reddish pigment that is used for coloring fabrics and makeup.We got some bug “war paint” and carried on towards our first campsite.Mount Victoria was visible along the trail. It’s the only snow-capped mountain among the Andes we could see.We walked 10 kilometers in total and felt pretty good once we reached camp. The view from our tent looked down onto the valley below with Mount Victoria in the distance.Day one success! However, Day 2 is supposed to knock our socks off!    Inca Trail Day 2: “The Challenge”We were up at 5:00 am and greeted with coca tea in our tent. Coca tea is made from coca leaves which are used for all kinds of things in Peru.Yes, they are from the same plant used to make cocaine. No, chewing or brewing the leaves does not get you high.Coca leaves, in their natural state, are a traditional part of everyday life for Peruvians.I couldn’t sleep at all the first night of the trek, so I woke up feeling completely useless and unprepared for the most challenging day of the four-day trek. For the length of the trek, we hired a porter.“Porter” is a term used for Peruvian men (usually believed to be the descendants of the Incans for their endurance!) that are available for hire to carry additional cargo if you need help along the trail. These men are incredible!They would literally run past us up the mountain (while we struggled to catch our breath) carrying 20 kilos of gear. Most of them were wearing sandals! (I highly recommend hiring a Porter if you are nervous about carrying heavy weight during the trek. It’s difficult without any cargo)!Sage advice? Pack as light as possible. If you can help it, only carry a hydration pack with water and a light jacket that you can tie around your waist if you warm up. The porters will speed off ahead of your group, so once you start the day, you won’t see them again until you reach camp!Now, where was I?We walked for hours upon hours up countless stairs and up steep hills for what seemed like an eternity. Because of the altitude, I felt like I couldn’t fill my lungs with a full breath of air and would get winded really easily.Today was definitely as challenging as they warn you it will be.During a two hour stretch of the trail, we hiked a steep incline along a cliff edge and far below us, we could see wild deer and llamas roaming the valley. I may have felt like I was dying, but the view was incredible.As we passed through rainy jungles and freezing cold stretches of the trail I tried to stay focused to keep putting one foot in front of the other.   Eventually, we made it past what is known as “Dead Woman’s Pass” to the peak at 13,776 feet above sea level. No wonder they call it Dead Woman! RIP me.While it was quite the achievement, we then had another two-hour hike down the mountain in freezing cold conditions. By the time we reached camp, my body was aching and all I wanted to do was pass out in our tent.Alas, here I am blogging.While it sounds like I had a terrible day, it was also unforgettable. During the 12+ hours of hiking, I had a lot of challenging moments but also found some parts to be invigorating.I found that listening to my iPod during the most difficult parts of the trek made setting a pace a lot easier. I basically danced my way up the mountain.Thank goodness for hour-long dance music playlists.Our campsite for Day 2 has an incredible view and I’m hoping that I’ve exhausted myself enough to get a better night’s sleep. 16 km tomorrow!Read More: How to Prepare for Hiking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu   Andean MountainsInca Trail Day 3: “Unforgettable”We were up at 5:00 am again. And again, I didn’t get a wink of sleep. Today was our longest trek, in total 10 miles, up and down the Andean mountains.It was a beautiful day… bright and sunny! So, we took our sweet time taking in the beautiful surroundings.We saw hundreds of lupines and orchids as we hiked through endless jungles and archaeological sites. It took almost 12 hours to finally reach our campsite after stopping at different sites and taking multiple breaks.We ended our day just as Machu Picchu mountain appeared through the distant haze. We are just one sleep away from finally reaching Machu Picchu!Day three down, one more to go.The anticipation is killing me but, not gonna lie. But, I’m also getting excited about a warm bed and hot shower!  View from Puerta del SolInca Trail Day 4: “Machu Picchu”It was a 6 km hike to Machu Picchu and we left in the pouring rain and in the pitch black of the early morning. It took a couple of hours to reach Puerta del Sol, or Sun Gate, the first place you can see Machu Picchu from on the trail.The view of Machu Picchu from above was insane! The previous three days of trekking leading up to the moment when it emerged from the clouds was indescribable.I completed the Inca Trail!!!It was one of the most physically challenging experiences in my life that made me face some of my own personal challenges as well. I spent a lot of time reflecting on my accomplishments, goals, successes, as well as challenges from this year and feel like I have a new clear conscience to take with me from this experience.We hiked another hour downhill until we reached the site of Machu Picchu. It was raining but it actually added to the feeling we had when we arrived.Unbelievable, indescribable… that doesn’t even begin to sum it up.We spent a few hours at the Machu Picchu taking pictures, hugging llamas and playing hide and seek around the ruins. The best part of hiking down from Puerta del Sol at sunrise is that you get to be some of the first people at the site.We had lunch in Aguas Calientes, the town just down the way from Machu Picchu, then took the train for a 3.5-hour journey back to Urubamba. From there, we took the bus to Cusco. Needless to say, it was a looooong day! Our guides and group all planned to go out in Cusco to celebrate, so we powered through the exhaustion and went out for a drink at a place in Cusco called Lek.We got down with our bad selves. It was a great way to end an absolutely unforgettable experience!REMINDER: I hiked the Inca Trail in 2011 (before I had this blog) and never got the information of the tour operator for our guides on the Inca Trail. We were volunteering with an orphanage and our contact there helped us book the hike.    Are you planning on hiking the Inca Trail? Let me know in the comments below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/for-purpose-adventure-fundraising/,For-Purpose Adventure “Fun”draising!,Peru,"The last two months were pure insanity to say the least… I finally came home after almost 4 months of traveling on October 2nd and flew out that same day on a spontaneous trip to New York for a two night stay. I went to Las Vegas the following weekend, San Diego the weekend after that, moved everything out of my apartment in Hollywood back to my parents house, spent Halloween weekend in Las Vegas, and then went to New York AGAIN the next week!The past two months taught me a lot about myself. Getting home I realized that the world keeps moving, whether I am there or not, and that the experiences I had abroad really did help me return to my “life” with a new perspective and a new purpose.I was ready for a new adventure and this time I was getting EVERYONE involved.So what’s next for The Blonde Abroad? PERU! After my friend Lindsay joined me for two weeks of my trip this summer while in Thailand and Cambodia, we  decided to collaborate on a “for-purpose” adventure benefiting a non-profit organization called Peruvian Hearts.We had 4 weeks with a goal of raising $10,000 and we were seriously winging it! Fundraising on this level is something I’ve never done before.I’ve fundraised a few hundred dollars for my volunteer effort with Global Water Brigades in Honduras, but this was a whole new animal. Lindsay owns her own event management and staffing company, and I have worked in the promotions and spokes-modeling industry for over 5 years, so we made the perfect team.Between both of our contacts in the promotional and event space we made huge successes in a short amount of time and were able to organize FIVE fundraisers!So why Peruvian Hearts? I have always been passionate about supporting non-profit organizations that are already established, doing amazing things, but are simply underfunded.And even more specifically, I am very passionate about organizations founded by young persons, organizations that support the empowerment of young girls and women, and organizations that promote literacy.Peruvian HeartsPeruvian Hearts was founded by a girl named Ana Dodson who was adopted from Cusco, Peru at four years old. On her first visit back to Cusco at only 11 years old she felt such compassion for the orphan girls that she decided to establish Peruvian Hearts.Peruvian Hearts works with adolescent girls to empower them to become strong women who have the capacity to transform their own lives and become leaders in their families, communities, and country. We couldn’t have found a more perfect cause to support!Now back to our fundraising…The first step in beginning our fundraising was incorporating www.StayClassy.org. We were able to create a fundraising website to raise money for Peruvian Hearts.StayClassy revolutionizes fundraising because it allows donors to use credit cards via online payment and the funds go DIRECTLY to the organization with only a small administrative fee. http://www.stayclassy.org/charity/peruvian-hearts/c6987… Check!Beer and Food Pairing at The FoundryOur first event was during San Diego Beer Week, so we asked for help from Lindsay’s friend, Eddie, who just opened up a craft beer bar in North Park called The Foundry. (It already has 4 stars and 114 Yelp reviews)!He helped us put together a special event with a custom Beer Flight and Beer Pairing Menu and donated 25% of sales which resulted in $300 raised by the end of the day. One down… four to go!Peruvian Hearts at Guesthouse NightclubNext we did a “Black Friday Charity Bikini Fashion Show” the day after Thanksgiving. We got help from La Isla Bikinis to donate bikinis for the models and a new (and very fabulous) downtown salon called Inga Bezio Salon to pretty us all up for the event.Some of Lindsay’s amazing and beautiful LMH Promotions models donated their hot bods as well and helped us raise over $400 in a single night! Two down… three to go!In Memory of Michel Rose David at The Ivy San DiegoOur third event was tackled by Lindsay and she did an amazing job raising awareness for Peruvian Hearts. Our “Paz Y Amor” Pink Party benefiting Peruvian Hearts was held at the Ivy Hotel in San Diego in honor of Lindsay’s close friend, Michel Rose David, and her generous spirit and love for South America. A close friend of mine from college, Paul, helped establish Pura Vida Bracelets and donated bracelets to help raise funds at the event.Pura Vida Bracelets is another amazing company that helps provide full-time jobs for local artisans in Costa Rica from sales of their super trendy bracelets. Between bracelet sales and the donations made at the Pink Party, we raised over $350! Three down… two to go!“Cheers for Charity” Mixer at Drai’s HollywoodThe next event was my baby. As a former bartender at Drai’s Hollywood at the W Hotel I was able to lock in a formal holiday mixer at the nightclub.Drai’s donated the club to us at no cost and it turned out to be a classy, intimate, & fun event with amazing guests & incredible sponsors. I sought help from all of my peers and contacts in LA, including a local non-profit TKO Helping Hands, and was able to create a raffle with some unbelievable auction items including an Equinox gym membership, a USC Dream Football Package, an LA Kings autographed hockey stick and game tickets, Disney on Ice tickets, Astor & Black custom neckties, a gorgeous custom designed prayer bead necklace, a luxurious spa package for Los Angeles Nail Garden, and bottle service at Drai’s following our party. Lindsay helped put the icing on the cake by getting two pairs of stylish sunglasses and gift bags donated by LMH Promotion’s client, GUESS.Lindsay and I hosting our Drai’s Hollywood Mixer Our guests enjoying the “Cheers for Charity” MixerI was even fortunate enough to find a Peruvian liquor company, Pisco Porton, who not only donated their delicious product, but purchased 100 drinks to offer complimentary Peruvian cocktails for all of our guests. It really was beyond any of our expectations!We raised over $1,000 in just a few short hours and the feeling of accomplishment we left with was worth even more. It was definitely a successful Fun”Drai’s”er! Four down… and still ONE more!The event flyer for our Searsucker Charity BrunchOur final event was held the day before our departure at a fantastic Downtown San Diego restaurant, Searsucker. We organized a Sunday Champagne Brunch with 20% of our guests’ brunch sales donated to Peruvian Hearts.It was an amazing brunch with $10 bottomless mimosas, delicious food, and our closest friends. Lindsay helped with another raffle with prizes like Atelier Aucoin Salon services, 2 FreeRide Skateboards, The Foundry Gift Certificates, Livebattle Lazertag, a month membership to Undispiuted MMA gym, and more Pura Vida bracelets for sale.Our last and final donor was Model Citizen Fund that creates emergency survival backpack kits for disaster relief. They kindly donated 30 backpacks to Peruvian Hearts and had them shipped down to the orphanage. We ended up raising over $500 from the Searsucker Charity Brunch!The Searsucker Brunch was a huge success!After all of our hard work, we raised over $5,500 for Peruvian Hearts! We didn’t hit our goal of $10,000 but we were nowhere near disappointed. $400 will provide an opportunity for one Peruvian Promise scholar to attend private school for an entire year.That means our efforts will provide a years worth of education for 13 girls and there will still be some money to spare. Damn that feels good!Our Successful Fundraising!So you see? If we could do it, so can you! Get creative, inspire your friends to join your team, and get out there and make a difference!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-best-food-krakow-poland/,"Where to Find the Best Food in Krakow, Poland",Poland,"This Krakow Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!Krakow is understated, charming, and has an air of melancholy about it. You can feel the history pulsing through the small streets, decades after they were home to some of history’s most extraordinary events.  Though I was only here for two days, Krakow left an impression on me. The main areas to explore are Stare Miasto, which translates to the Old Town, and Kazimierz, the Jewish Quarter. To go even further into the city’s emotional past, cross the Vistula River and find Schindler’s Factory. Here you’ll get a feel for a less gentrified area. While history is very evident in this small city, you can tell that residents have gone through great lengths to rebuild its bones and core. As I explored this fascinating place, I of course ate my way through the city!Here’s where to find the best food in Krakow, Poland.Marchewka z GroszkiemMarchewka z Groszkiem serves as the perfect entry to a couple of days in Krakow. Night number one brought me to this dark, candlelit, traditional restaurant. I chose to try the dumplings stuffed with spinach and cheese.The menu is full of country staples like Polish soups and meat and trout variations, all worth trying at some point while visiting this country. Youmiko Sushi Vegan sushi is a pure contradiction, but it absolutely worked here. Right in the heart of the Jewish Quarter is the small but funky Youmiko Sushi, churning out some of the most excellent tasting sushi creations I’ve come across.  The fact that all of this is done sans fish makes it all the more impressive and unique. A must try.HamsaAs would be expected, there are several Israeli restaurants to be found in Krakow. The one I went to was Hamsa, found behind the brick walls right in the center of Kazimierz. The dedication to hummus is overly apparent, but the food is solid enough to push that aside. The great atmosphere makes for a very enjoyable lunch backdrop.Milkbar TomaszaThe Polish milk bars are ex-Socialist era workers’ canteens. In their previous incarnations they were run as government subsidized cafes where workers could get a good, nutritious and affordable meal. The first milk bar was set up in 1896, and the trend has continued into present day Krakow. Milkbar Tomasza gives you a fun and interesting “back in the day” feel worth experiencing. Alchemia and Forum PrzestrzenieHere are two bars definitely worth visiting. One of the most evocative cocktail bars, Alchemia is reminiscent of decades past. Forum Przestrazenie gives a look into a modern and changing Krakow, set up for those looking to have some drinks in lounge chairs as the sun sets on the water’s edge.   "
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-warsaw-poland/,"Where to Find the Best Food in Warsaw, Poland",Poland,"This Warsaw Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!When you’re a New Yorker living in London for a couple of years, a few things are bound to happen; 1) you start thinking 65 degrees is hot  2) words that initially made you cringe, like maths or tenner, suddenly begin to sound a lot more normal and 3) the more obscure European cities that are not on the standard to-do lists become attainable weekend excursions.  I’ve been to Warsaw twice now.  Once about seven years ago with my friend Emily to her family’s house, and another more recently for her wedding.  Both times I got the insider looks, the local recommendations, and incredible experiences.I can see going to Warsaw and not loving it.  I can understand feeling like its central point is Old Town, and not getting much deeper than that.  What a lot don’t know, and do not naturally associate with Warsaw, is a city full of blossoming creativity, a strong fashion and start up community and while not endless, a solid list of restaurants, cafes and bars to explore.Bars in WarsawWeles: Weles is a dark speakeasy you’ll find at the end of a long alley.  Don’t be deterred, keep on going.  This is a great place to start your night.Grunt i Woda: Grunt i Woda is the kind of place that makes you feel a hint of Berlin while standing in Warsaw.  Totally open air, along the river, super casual with DJ’s and a vibe that screams please just relax and have some fun.  Open until the early hours of the morning.Na Lato: This is guaranteed late night fun in a casual garden setting.Restaurants in WarsawSAM (Powisle Location): I never expected to find a menu like the one SAM has in Poland.  Eclectic health juices, “fitness” omelettes packed with seeds, spinach and avocado or hummus and tabbouleh mezze plates, this boasts a casual cafe feel reminiscent of what you’d find somewhere like London or New York.Warszawa Powisle: Warszawa Powisle was once an old train station ticket office that has been converted into both a club as well as an all day food destination.  It’s casual and laid-back but boasts some tasty traditional Polish cuisine.Restaurante Kultura: If you do need a meal in Old Town, have one here. Restaurante Kultura actually looks like the exact opposite of anywhere I’d normally like to eat (read: potentially touristy and without much character at first glance) but I was proved wrong pretty quickly.  The seeded bread and butter and the beet soup were excellent.U Kucharzy: U Kucharzy is located within the Museum of Archeology and is one of the more imaginative restaurants in Warsaw.  I went here on my first trip to Warsaw, and still have a vivid memory of the sleekly dressed wait staff delivering our food on a rolled out cart and constructing the meal as I watched.Hala Koszyki: Koszyki is a three story market hall with international food stalls, bars, shops and grocery stores and is the only market like this in all of Poland.  Young patrons come at night, using the space to catch up with friends or during the day, to grab a beer at the long bar and some tapas before heading back to work.Ale Wino: This is where you go for simple and sophisticated Polish-Italian cuisine.  Interesting sounding combination, but it works.Blikle: Blikle is one of the oldest cafes in Poland. Known for its historical place on the map as well as its delicious pastries, take a seat at the marble counter and order up a helping of a Nepoleon, a Polish donut or a sernik krakowski (a rich Polish cheesecake from Krakow) and enjoy your trip back in time.Mezze and Relaks Kawiarnia: I also went to a more residential area called Mokotow on my last trip. It’s definitely quiet and feels super suburban, but if you’re looking to venture a little further into local Warsaw this is an easy way to do it.Stop by Mezze for delicious falafel or peak your head into Relaks Kawiarnia for a look at what a hip local coffee shop in Warsaw looks like.Shop my looks for Poland!!function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1507542072147?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script');  Read Next: 5 Romantic Places for Couples in the Czech Republic Read MoreThe Most Romantic Destinations in Europe15 Tips for Traveling EuropeTen Itinerary Planning Tips for a Trip to EuropeTop 10 Weekend Getaways in EuropeThe Beginner’s Guide to Train Travel in EuropeThe Beginner’s Guide to Backpacking Europe"
https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-visit-portugal/,The Best Time to Travel to Portugal,Portugal,"Portugal is a country that truly has it all—from white sand beaches to architecturally beautiful cities to all the wine you can drink! It’s no wonder that it has become an extremely popular destination amongst tourists, especially solo female travelers.Because there’s so much to do and see and the country has a wide variety of landscapes, choosing the best time to visit can seem a bit overwhelming.Although it can get cold and wet during the winter months, there really is no “wrong” or “right” time to visit. There are so many unique festivals and seasonal draws that are worth experiencing. It really just depends what you’re interested in!Whether you’re wanting to head to Porto to sample all the famous Port wine, or you’re looking for the best time to head to Sintra…Here is my guide to help you figure out the best time to visit Portugal for you!  LisbonMarch to MaySpringtime in Portugal is one of the best times to visit the country.Doors of attractions that closed down in the winter open once again, welcoming tourists with open arms. Colorful flowers begin to bloom and the hills turn a vibrant green. The chance of rain is quite likely throughout the day so you will want to have some flexibility in your itinerary if you have outdoor plans.However, the storms are usually interspersed with periods of sunshine and blue skies so don’t let this deter you. If you don’t mind a little rain, you’ll also avoid the heavy summer crowds that haven’t made their way to Portugal yet!In the spring, you’ll find many celebrations including numerous cheese festivals, a fish festival taking place in Lisbon during April, a chocolate festival in Obidos, a flower festival in Maderia, and the Iberian Mask Festival in May in Lisbon.Count me in!!   June to SeptemberSummer in Portugal means plenty of sunshine which draws crowds from all over the world. The streets, beaches, and sites are bustling with tourists, making it harder to navigate around. Because of this, prices also rise up to 30% and local transportation options typically sell out. Booking in advance is recommended if you decide to visit during the summer months to help save you some money, time, and a headache.Afternoons do get plenty warm so when planning out your itinerary, make sure to plan for some indoor activities to escape the heat—museums are great for this!If you don’t mind bumping shoulders with other tourists, summer is one of the best times to visit Portugal’s coast. The coast, particularly Nazaré and all along Algarve (Portugal’s southernmost region), is full of locals and visitors alike, as many people are looking to soak up some time in the warm turquoise water.Can you blame them?  October to NovemberAutumn in Portugal is another wonderful time to visit as the crowds have left and the weather begins to cool down. The vineyards and oak forests start to change color, painting them in the autumnal reds and golds. To get the best of these fall hues, visit the forests of Coimbra, Serra de Estrela, or Montesinho Natural Park.This is also when grape harvesting begins so if it’s your dream to sip on some Portuguese wine at a vineyard, fall is the ideal time. Just be sure to pack some layers!If you’re interested in heading the famed Porto for all its iconic wine, I’d highly recommend booking a wine tasting tour. You can even do a wine tasting tour out of Lisbon!Fall is also a wonderful time to visit if you’re looking to experience food-related festivals. Honey and chestnut festivals take place in Lousã and a mushroom festival is held in Fundao. 10 Local Foods to Try in PortugalReally want to dive into Portuguese food? Make sure to check out this guide to 10 local foods to try in Portugal! Read MoreDecember to FebruaryWinter in Portugal can get quite chilly and many resorts shut down.Tourist attractions have shorter hours and availability, making planning a vacation a bit more tricky. If you plan ahead, dress warm, and pack an umbrella. This is still a wonderful time to visit as there are few crowds and lodging is very affordable.It’s also possible to spend your winter months skiing in Portugal. With one ski resort in the Serra da Estrela Mountains, you can spend your days on the slopes before wandering the streets lined with Christmas market stalls.If you feel like extending your trip, ring in the new year in Madeira, a spot famous for its fireworks display or visit Praia dos Pescadores in Algarve. There are also special concerts all throughout the country to welcome the new year.And lastly, Three Kings’ Day takes place on January 6th and marks the end of the holiday season. Many local families have a traditional meal, carolers go door to door singing, and children often receive gifts. So if you’re here during that period, you can enjoy all the festive merriment!OverallLike I mentioned above, there’s no “right” or “wrong” time to visit Portugal—it truly just depends on what activities you want to take part in and what kind of weather you’d prefer!Shoulder seasons are great to score some deals and also beat the crowds but do keep in mind that some coastal and resort towns might not have as many places open for that reason.Have you been to Portugal or are you planning to go?

And I’m guessing you might be in a similar boat. Known for their seafood and wide variety of spices, Portuguese food is Mediterranean food at its finest!So whether you’re a newbie when it comes to Portuguese cuisine or you’re super familiar with their dishes, I dare you to try one of these! Oh and don’t even get me started on the incredible markets and their fresh produce…Here are 10 local foods you absolutely need to try when visiting Portugal!Cozido à PortuguesaCozido a Portuguesa is one of the most popular dishes in Portugal, but even with its popularity, it’s difficult to trace its origins.The dish itself is a platter of meats, sausage, and vegetables. Every region of Portugal has its own variation…so you might just need to try this wherever you go!For example, in the northeastern part of Portugal, cozido contains breaded sausage (farinheira), blood sausage (morcela), and sausage mixed with game and bread (alheira). In the Algarve, the dish is often served with mint and potato.FeijoadaFeijoada is Portugal’s definition of comfort food. It is a stew of beans, pork, and vegetables. It’s packed with the flavor of cumin, cloves, garlic, and paprika.If you’re traveling along the coast, you might find feijoada that substitutes pork with seafood.Peixinhos da HortaPeixinhos da Horta literally translates to “little fish from the garden” due to its resemblance to small pieces of colorful fish. It is usually prepared with green beans in a wheat flour-based batter that is then deep-fried.  Yum!  Caparica, PortugalAlheira de MirandelaAlheira de Mirandela is a dish with quite a long history.When the Jewish population was expelled to Portugal in the late 1400s, they took refuge in the mountains of Tras-os-Montes in northeastern Portugal. They pretended to have converted to Catholicism to remain safe and one way to display this was to eat sausages so that everyone thought that they were no longer kosher.Since then, the dish has become extremely popular in every restaurant and cafe in the country. It’s also very budget-friendly!Sardinhas AssadasSardinhas assadas is typical comfort food of Portugal. The platter of grilled sardines typically involves leaving the fish intact, bones and all. When eaten, you avoid the spine by biting into the side.The flaky white meat is combined with the smoky crispy skin to pack a flavorful punch.  Bifanas Francesinha Bifanas + FrancesinhaIt was too difficult to choose between these delicious sandwiches…so you’ll just have to try both!Simply put, a bifana—the national Portuguese sandwich—is a DELICIOUS pork sandwich. Much like cozido, the sandwich will vary depending on the region you visit.If you’re visiting Porto, you’ve got to try the Francesinha Sandwich, the famous Portuguese food from Porto. It’s essentially the Portuguese version of the croque-monsieur.While it’s mainly found in Porto, you can often find it in cafés all throughout Portugal. Instead of being filled with ham and cheese, it’s got allllll the works: ham, linguiça sausage, steak, and cheese. And then it’s covered in a beer-tomato sauce and served with fries!Arroz de MariscoArroz de marisco is a seafood rice that consists of shrimp, clams, mussels, lobster, crab, scallops, and rice. It’s very similar to Spanish paella, but can often have a stew-like quality. AçordaAçorda is a dish made of day-old bread and poached eggs, served in an herbed broth.This meal is a typical countryside meal from Alentejo. If you go inland, the dish is enhanced with meats like wild game and on the coast, the version might contain shrimp or fish.Caldo VerdeCaldo verde is a Portuguese soup made up of potatoes, collard greens, olive oil, garlic, onion, and salt. Some recipes may add meat such as ham, making it similar to Italo-American wedding soup. It’s the perfect healthy comfort food for a cold day.   Polvo a LagareiroIf you haven’t noticed yet, the Portuguese love their seafood.And this holds true yet again with polvo a lagareiro, a dish that consists of a whole octopus that is boiled and then roasted with garlic and olive oil. You will find this dish in any city in the country, though it is best enjoyed in Nazare, a seaside village.Pastel de NataLast but not least, a Portuguese dessert!Pastel de nata is a sweet and creamy egg tart that is quite addicting. Made up of flour, butter, cinnamon, eggs, and of course, sugar. The dough has a crispy outer shell that melts in your mouth the minute you take a bite. Enjoy with a cup of Portuguese coffee and you will feel like you are in heaven.  BonusDidn’t get enough seafood? Don’t worry, Portugal dishes it out in spades!Make sure to try bacalhau—it’s the most quintessential food of Portugal. It’s a salted cod but they prepare it in a zillion different ways! Some of the more popular ways are:Bacalhau com Natas: this is one of the most popular recipes. It’s comprised of thinly sliced potatoes combined with cream, onions, and the fish, and then baked in the oven.Bacalhau à Gomes de Sá: this one originates from Porto! It’s salted cod, onions, and potatoes (so similar to the above), but then garnished with hard-boiled eggs and black olives.Bacalhau à Brás: the salted cod is cooked with shredded potatoes, and onions, and mixed together with scrambled eggs. Yum!Bacalhau com broa: salted cod with breadcrumbs and then baked OverallThough many people aren’t familiar with Portugal’s food, it’s a country that is filled with comfort dishes, delicious seafood, and desserts that will leave you wanting more.Whether you’re visiting Portugal or you just want to give the dishes a chance in your hometown, try one of these 10 dishes to get a true sense of what the country’s culinary scene is really like!I’d love to hear what about the Portuguese dishes you’ve tried in the comments below!

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-spend-a-day-in-aveiro-portugal/,"How to Spend a Day in Aveiro, Portugal",Portugal,"This post was written by expert vagabond, Ana, from The Art of Epic Living!Aveiro, Portugal, otherwise known as the “Venice of Portugal” is an adorable little fishing town about 40 minutes south of Porto. It can be described as overwhelmingly charming and picturesque. It is a small and very walkable city, and one could easily cover the whole city center within an hour or two. Aveiro is divided by scenic waterways, where colorful gondola-style boats pass through.The buildings and homes create a unique mosaic of colors and patterns, and the beautiful flowers, parks and gardens add to the magic!Although Aveiro is smaller and less-explored than the more popular cities in Portugal, I highly recommend that you plan to visit for a day or two. It is a perfect stopover if you are traveling between Lisbon and Porto, and it is a quick and affordable day trip if you’re nearby.I personally spent two days and two nights there, but if you opt for something shorter, here’s how to spend a day in Aveiro, Portugal! Take a Moliceiro Ride Around TownThe thing you definitely have to do during a trip to Aveiro is take a trip on the colorful canal boats, otherwise known as  “moliceiros”. A moliceiro trip through this quaint city will provide you with a unique viewpoint so you can admire the city from the water.The tour guides (all of whom speak English, French, Spanish & Portuguse) will teach you fun and interesting facts about the city’s sites and history. The moliceiro rides last 45 minutes, and will take you through the center, as well as to the outskirts of the city.  A ride can cost between 5-10 euros, and there are multiple stands where you can buy your ticket all along the water. If you would like to avoid the heat, it is recommended that you go in the morning, however it is not uncommon to experience cloud cover in Aveiro up until about noon.  If you prefer the sunshine, you can go at any point in the afternoon, up until 5pm when the boat tours end for the day. I went around noon on a clear day, and loved it!Wander Through the Winding StreetsSimply wandering through the quaint and colorful streets of Aveiro was probably my favorite “activity”! Each building is uniquely different from the next, and you can admire a wide range of tilework and color combinations through each tiny street. Portugal is known for its tall and narrow buildings, and beautiful tilework, and Aveiro definitely holds true to that look. Although I loved my moliceiro ride through the canals, I found that the best way to discover Aveiro was to simply get lost in the streets.Photoshoot Around AveiroAs you might assume by now, Aveiro is an incredibly photogenic place. If you are visiting, I would highly recommend that you take advantage of the photo opportunities in front of its scenic waterways and buildings. All areas of Aveiro will provide you with the perfect backdrop for amazing Instagram photos!Shop in AveiroRight in the center of town, there is a huge shopping area, filled with all of the European favorites- Zara, Bershka, Pull & Bear… the list goes on. I’m not much of a shopper, but I have to admit, I did take advantage of the many stores and sales that were only a two minute walk away from my hotel. Take a Trip to Costa Nova from AveiroThe nearby beach town of Costa Nova is an easy taxi or bus ride away from the city center of Aveiro. If you would like to spend part of your trip in Aveiro at the beach, or experience a drastic change of scenery, then I would recommend that you check out Costa Nova.  Costa Nova is known for its interesting architecture and striped houses. In addition to the quirky houses, the town is home to a variety of seafood restaurants, cafes, shops and beach bars. Taxis or buses will drop you off along the main road of the town, and you can easily arrive at the beach in about five minutes by foot from there. There is a wooden walkway that stretches along the beach, which is dotted with a variety of places to grab a snack or drink. The long stretch of sand provides endless places to settle into a good spot for suntanning, people-watching or picnicking. I loved zoning out, watching the waves and the surfers. Since this beach is on the Atlantic, the water seemed pretty cold, so it might not be ideal for swimming. The town is about 10 minutes away via taxi, and it will cost you about 12 euros from the center of Aveiro. If you prefer the cheaper route, a 2 euro bus will get you there in about 45 minutes to an hour. Wine and Dine in AveiroFirst, let’s talk about dining in Aveiro. As mentioned, this is a fishing town, so there are countless fresh, seafood restaurants along the water and through the winding streets to choose from. You can choose from one of the many open-air cafes in the main squares of town, or visit the rooftop restaurant of Restaurante Mercado Piexe Aveiro, for the ultimate sunset view. If seafood isn’t your thing, I was able to discover the most adorable cafe with a full vegan menu. For some traditional Portuguese food (vegan-style) then you have to go to Espaco Criativo Biscoito. The owner of this cafe is an amazing human, and she will whip up anything from “Portuguese NON-meatballs” to veggie lasagna to curry dishes! YUM!Now, let’s talk about the wining. Did you know that Port Wine is native to the Douro Valley of Northern Portugal? Port wine is a very popular drink to try out while in Portugal, especially in the north. If you have never tasted port wine, beware that it is very sweet and also stronger than normal, dry wine. Many prefer to sip it as part of a cocktail, or choose to try it as an aperitif or dessert wine. Either way, I suggest that you at least give it a try. You can also choose from a variety of local dry wines such as reds, whites, rosé, and even “vinho verde” which is a green wine! Aveiro is a sleepy town with not much of a nightlife, but if you would like to continue your cocktail-ing, you can find live music and good vibes at the upstairs bar on the main street known as Mercado Negro, which stays open until 2am.That concludes my to-do list if you plan to explore through Aveiro. I highly recommend that you check out this unbelievably charming little town, you will not regret it!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/where-to-find-the-best-food-in-lisbon-portugal/,"Where to Find the Best Food in Lisbon, Portugal",Portugal,"This Lisbon Foodie Guide was written by our International Food Expert, Kate, from We Travel We Eat!I am overwhelmed with how much love I felt for the colorful, charismatic, and endlessly charming city of Lisbon. I went for the first time in 2009 when I was 27 but discovered a whole new appreciation for what the “seven hills” had to offer this time around.Maybe I am a more efficient, more researched, more sophisticated traveler at this point in my life or I just explore with a different persistence and fervor than I used to, but certain destinations really get to the core of me these days.Lisbon has without a doubt jumped toward the top of my list in terms of favorite European cities. The people are genuine and kind, sparking blue water and endless, captivating views are everywhere you turn. The colors and radiance of so many of the buildings are bright and beguiling.My last venture to the no–longer-hidden gem of Europe came out of nowhere. Minimal preparation, maximum spontaneity and adventure. To say I packed things in during my four day visit is an understatement.I easily put a week’s worth of activities into just a couple of days, walking nearly thirty miles up, down, and around the cascading cobblestone streets during this time.I spent much of my stay weaving in and out of cafés, stores, bookstores, and restaurants as I went. Here is where to find the best food in Lisbon, Portugal.Mercado de Ribiera (Time Out Market)When you land at six a.m. after taking a red eye, there aren’t a ton of options as to where your day can start. Meals begin later in Lisbon, even breakfast, which is why the famous Time Out Market is the perfect place to kick off your time here.Markets aren’t always my favorite; they can seem super contrived and very much cater to a foreign, rather than local audience. Going here in the morning before most stalls were even open was the way to do it.You can grab a coffee and pasteis de nata (egg tart pastries) if you’d like and watch the older generation of Lisbonites pick up its day’s fruits and veggies as the sun is coming up.Dear BreakfastDear Breakfast, as the name signifies, really does feel like a love letter to this very important part of the day. White washed and airy, this is the calming oasis you want to eat a leisurely breakfast in.The dark ceramic plates are gorgeous, and the food is meticulously arranged. Get the scrambled eggs with scallions and black truffles, grab a magazine from the wall, and ease into day one in Lisbon.ManteigariaManteigaria is the clear winner for pasteis de nata.Located off a square in Chiado, Manteigaria is a tiny storefront where you can see locals stopping by for a quick espresso, having a chat with a friend, or getting lost watching the production of these ridiculously tasty little treats.Enoteca de BelemI had heard good things about Enoteca de Belem. Walking in, I will admit, I was not actually sure if I was in the right place. The aesthetics were underwhelming, and this small place had only a couple of tables.Within one moment of eating, it was established that yes, I most certainly was right where I was supposed to be.The salmon tartare in a sort of miso sauce was outstanding, followed by one of the most tender pieces of octopus I’ve ever come across. It was laid on top of a sweet potato mash along with spinach and a light pesto sauce.First impressions most certainly are not always the right ones.Pasteis de BelemPeople flock to Pasteis de Belem for the famous Portuguese pasteis de nata; the line was wrapped around the corner when I went.Go here just to go, as this is a longstanding Portuguese institution (the real standout for pasteis de nata , though, is Manteigaria, like I said above).Pasteis de Belem should be part of an afternoon spent in Belem, walking the water, relaxing at the MAAT museum, and eating said octopus at Enoteca de Belem. The two spots are right around the corner from one another.Lx FactoryThe Lx Factory, set beneath the Ponte 25 de Abril (April 25th Bridge), is a combination of photography studios, freelance work spaces, coffee shops, bookstores, and eateries.The bookstore housed here, Ler Devager, is worth visiting in its own right. The ceilings are high, and the walls are filled with colorful books arranged behind crisscrossing staircases and moving mobiles that give the illusion of the machine work on the inside of a clock.It was late afternoon when I went; the sun was setting and young patrons were settling into their weekends, gathering with friends over a drink or catching the last of the day’s warmth on their own.Mercado de Campo de OuriqueLocated a bit out of the way, or at least outside of the normal tourist circuit in the upscale white-washed Ourique neighborhood, this venue felt warmer and more intimate than the better-know Time Out Market.I went for dessert and indulged in the chocolate pie from Depois. You can find whatever you want here though, from desserts to tapas.TapiscoI’m not sure I ever would have believed that I’d a.) be talked into ordering cuttlefish and b.) like these fried critters so much that I almost went twice in one trip for them, but that was the case for me at this tapas + petiscos (Spanish + Portuguese) restaurant, aptly named Tapisco.Tapisco felt super casual in the best way possible; it’s a no-fuss space with smiling staff you kind of want to be friends with, serving high quality food. Start your night off with the specialty cocktail, the Principe, made with Gin Nordés, Cucumber, Mint, and Vermouth Yzaguirre Blanco.Follow it up with paella negra or Tapisco’s version of bacalhau and, of course, the cuttlefish. You’ll be happy you did.Cervejaria RamiroCervejaria Ramiro is the epitome of simplistic seafood. Everything is absurdly fresh, and also incredibly uncomplicated. Seasoning is key, with most dishes having only butter, garlic, white wine, salt, or pepper as the central flavor.Established in 1956, this well-known haunt is both a local as well as an Anthony Bourdain favorite. It is also famous for its wait at all hours of the day. I went off hours at 3:30 p.m. on a Sunday and miraculously waited only about ten minutes (clearly this is the time to make the attempt).The move is to get the bread doused in butter, using it to dip in all of the sauces the dishes come in. The grilled shrimp sautéed in garlic were exceptional, and the giant tiger prawns were equally a stand out item.Hello, KristofMy favorite of all the coffee shops and cafés that I went to, Hello, Kristoff is a small space with a lot of heart. Owned by a coffee aficionado who doubles as a magazine publisher, this shop shows off these combined talents everywhere you look.It might look more Brooklyn than Lisbon inside as it churns out things like acai bowls and lattes with almond milk, but Hello, Kristof is a great place to sit for a moment, enjoy the quiet, and think about how you’re going to spend the rest of your day.Restaurante Esplanada FurnasAbout half an hour outside of Lisbon lies Ericeira, a charming Portuguese fishing town and one of the world’s top surfing reserves.Restaurante Esplanada Furnas was a major added bonus to this easy day trip. It offered a view of the Atlantic to die for and some fish to match. The restaurant is built right into the cliffs and the main dining area has only glass walls.Upon entry, you are greeted by the owner, an older man who asks that you pick out what you’d like to eat and talks you through how it will be served. Don’t forget to order a starter of shrimp too.Restaurante Ze da MourariaRestaurante Ze da Mouraria was a total last-minute decision, and it was one of the better meals I had during my time here. It is located in the old Moorish section of Lisbon, and the menu changes daily and serves lunch only.Local businessmen will likely be dining around you, sipping red wine and chatting as they indulge in this midday meal.Many Portuguese meals begin with an optional starter of things like bread, olives, or cheese (servers will often set it down on your table, and you have to say yes or no).Nod your okay to the bread in olive oil as well as the Portuguese nisa sheep cheese here, and then choose from the daily fish with broiled potatoes or the grilled meat.A CevicheriaPeruvian-style ceviche has been my favorite for years, ever since my trip to Lima in 2012. When I realized this was the version I’d be getting at A Cevicheria, I was extremely excited.A Cevicheria is fun, and it feels different. There’s a window at the front where those waiting for a table can order drinks from the street.The servers are likely to be dancing to the music in the background. And the food, specifically the puro ceviche served on top of sweet potato and leche de tigre, will leave you speechless.Fabrica Coffee RoasterFabrica is a funky little space run by a mix of Brazilians, Aussies, and Portuguese. With no available Wi-Fi and hardly any accessible cell service at all, Fabrica is a specialty coffee shop that wants to stay true to just that. The blends here are from Ethiopia, Brazil, Guatemala, and Rwanda.There are a couple of food items too, like its take on a pasteis de nata or a prosciutto, cheese, and arugula sandwich.TartineWhile it may not look like much right when you step in, Tartine was pleasantly surprising, especially its breakfast. Really good sourdough is pretty hard to come by, and Tartine’s excels.This coupled with simple scrambled eggs served as a perfect start to the day.Bettina & Niccolo CoralloI’m pretty certain that Bettina & Niccolo Corallo Chocolate Café produces the best chocolate I have ever had. The sorbet is an absolute must, with a texture so airy and a flavor so rich that it feels and tastes like a dark chocolate mousse.Made only of water, sugar, and cocoa beans, this is truly a step above the rest."

https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-buying-a-coco-de-mer-in-the-seychelles/,Tips for Buying a Coco De Mer in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"There’s a good chance you may have never heard of the Seychelles. The rocky grouping of islands is northeast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.These small little islands are made up of the clearest blue water you will ever see and unbelievably white sand. They’re the true definition of paradise.On my last trip, I was committed to buying a coco de mer. A coco de mer palm is an endangered ancient palm tree that produces large green nuts.The nuts themselves weigh anywhere from 30-70 pounds!They’re almost impossible to find, so here are some tips to help you find a coco de mer in the Seychelles!Coco De Mer on Mahé IslandIt’s challenging to find information on where to find a coco de mer. Initially, I had looked on Mahé Island though I was quickly turned away and told to go to Victoria Market.Victoria Market is a large artisan market where the locals do their food shopping.While I was unsuccessful at the market, I began to ask around, and they sent me on a goose chase to a small shop. It wasn’t a bad option, and they did have them in the back of the shop, but the shop is extremely hard to find. I couldn’t find it myself, and I eventually gave up.Coco De Mer on Praslin IslandI then moved my search to Praslin Island. My first stop was the Vallée de Mai, a nature reserve that is home to the largest concentration of coco de mer trees in the world. They have a gift shop there with coco de mer for sale.Sounds promising right?Well, the supply was extremely limited. So I decided to ask the shop staff if they knew somewhere to go. I was told to visit a shop that was about a 15-minute cab ride away. My non-helpful information is that I don’t remember the exact name of the place I went. All I remember is that it was another spot a little further past Vallée de Mai. One of the staff at Vallée de Mai should be able to explain where it is.When we got to the next shop, it felt a little bit like a back-alley deal. We were led into a small shed with coco de mer lying on different tables. It felt a bit sketchy, but they had all the licensing, and they were legit. I learned that this spot was the middleman between the farmers and the retail shops, so we had the option to buy for less than we would in a store.However, I still didn’t love any of the nuts for sale. I wanted a perfect coco de mer, without blemishes and with perfect symmetry. So, we pressed on.Coco De Mer at Anse LazioI continued my search on around Praslin Island until I was finally successful!Where did I hit the jackpot? At a beach called Anse Lazio.At Anse Lazio, there is a restaurant and bar right on the sand called Bonbon Plume. Not only do they have one of the best lunch views, but they also have a bookshop in the beach house with coco de mer nuts for sale.What they have on hand is what’s available so if you like one, get it. Otherwise, it might not be there when you return. Just make sure that it has the government seal and comes with the export license.If it doesn’t have these things, you won’t be able to leave the country with it, and there’s a chance you could be fined or even sent to prison. Also, be sure to look for any aesthetic flaws.Cost + SignificanceMy coco de mer cost me about $300 USD which may sound a bit expensive, but it’s a rare nut that makes one fantastic souvenir. Luckily the shop took credit cards!You’re probably wondering why I went through all this trouble in the first place. For one, The Seychelles Islands is the only place on Earth that coco de mer grows.It can take up to 40 years for a tree to reach adulthood! It then takes another 7-10 years for the nut to grow and to fall off the tree. Then, it takes ANOTHER 10 years for it to dry and be allowed for sale.It might sound like a silly journey to go on, but it’s so worth it if you’re traveling the islands. All in all, where there’s a will there’s a way.I was sent on quite the goose chase to find one, but I never gave up. All you have to do is ask around, and eventually, you will find one!A true “love nut” and an incredible story!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-sainte-anne-island-in-the-seychelles/,Exploring Sainte Anne Island in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"Sainte Anne Island was the first stop on our Crystal Esprit yacht cruise, and it was paradise. With endless lines of palm trees shading idyllic sandy beaches, this place is a dream.Located just four kilometers off the east coast of Mahé, this island is a must-see for any Seychelles visitor. Sainte Anne Island is the largest of Sainte Anne Marine National Park’s eight islands, and it is full of stunning beaches.Here’s how to make the most of your time exploring Sainte Anne Island in the Seychelles.What to ExpectWith balmy weather and warm seas all year long, Sainte Anne Island is all about living it up on the beach. The island is also home to the Sainte Anne Marine National Park which draws lots of visitors, and was in my opinion, one of the most beautiful spots of coastline!Sainte Anne Island is small, so it’s easy to wander from beach to beach while you are exploring.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to the Seychelles What to DoMost people come here to hit the beach and soak up the Seychelles sunshine! There are six main beaches on the island, and they are all worth exploring.Located in the southwest, Grande Anse is the biggest beach and one where you’ll definitely want to spend some time.If you’re lucky enough to be on the island from late November to February, you can see the sea turtles laying eggs at Anse Royale. I missed the prime time, but I still got to see lots of sea turtles and a healthy marine life.We took the yacht tender to a beautiful white-sand bar where Crystal Esprit had set up snorkeling equipment and stand-up paddle boards for us to enjoy.The other main beaches are Anse Tortues, Anse Cimitiere, Anse Manon, and Anse Cabot (FYI: Anse means cove or bay in French, so you’ll see this word a lot around the Seychelles).About Sainte Anne Marine National ParkSainte Anne Marine National Park is one of the most beautiful spots in the Seychelles; it was opened in 1973 as a way to preserve local wildlife and is the first such refuge in the Indian Ocean.Fishing and water skiing are banned from the area, and it’s the ideal place to get some peace and quiet.With its incredible underwater world, Sainte Anne Marine National Park is a popular spot for glass-bottom boat trips as well as snorkeling and diving. You’ll see stunning coral and vibrant tropical fish everywhere around the islands.The islands of the Sainte Anne Marine National Park, while tiny, have interesting stories to them.Cerf Island, the second largest in the park, has fewer than one hundred residents but is home to three resorts and a restaurant. Île Cachée, just off the shores of Cerf, is a popular nesting site for local seabirds.Round Island actually used to be a leper colony and is now home to the five-star Round Island Resort.Long Island, once a smallpox colony and prison, is now having a five-star resort developed on it. And there’s a lot of development in progress.In 2005, the government of the Seychelles decided it was too pricey to maintain the islands on its own and is now opening up the area to development. This means that a lot more hotels and resorts are on their way to the Sainte Anne Marine National Park, so change is a-coming.While the development seems to be well organized, I still recommend checking out the park while it’s in its wild state.Where to StayIf you want to stay on the island, there’s only one hotel: the Beachcomber Seychelles. Fortunately, it’s a gorgeous resort.It has eighty-seven private villas set in a picture-perfect tropical oasis. It offers all-inclusive package deals, and you can upgrade to get a private infinity pool. There’s chic Mediterranean cuisine and you’ll find amazing views along with a spa, pool, fitness center, and all of the other perks you’d expect form a top-notch resort."
https://theblondeabroad.com/a-guide-to-la-digue-island-in-the-seychelles/,A Guide to La Digue Island in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"Ready to truly get away from it all? If you’re looking to live on “island time,” then La Digue is your destination. It has the third largest population of the Seychelles, but you’d never know it.Most visitors to the Seychelles will hit Mahé Island, Praslin Island, and La Digue due to the close proximity and efficient ferry system.La Digue Island is all dirt roads and stunning natural beauty. I fell in love with the gorgeous bays, granite rocks, turquoise water, and vibrant coral reefs in this incredible place.Here’s my experience exploring La Digue Island in the Seychelles!Image CreditGetting To & Around La DigueLa Digue Island is the third largest island in terms of population, but only has about 3,000 people! The island is still the third most-traveled island in the archipelago since it is so accessible from Mahé and Praslin, but it still has a tranquility about it.Air Seychelles offers short island hopper flights from Mahé to Praslin, but nothing from La Digue—unfortunately, there’s no airport on La Digue, only a helipad. However, and there is a fast catamaran service between Praslin and Mahé, so it is easily accessible. I visited La Digue during a stop on my Seychelles cruise!There are very few cars on La Digue—I even heard there are only 6 taxis. The island spans just over ten square kilometers (or four square miles), so it’s easy to get around on foot or on a bike.I’d recommend opting for a bicycle!When you get into port, you’ll see a few different bike rental places, and they’ll get you set up to ride anywhere you need to on the island.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to the Seychelles What to Do on La DigueLa Digue Island is all about getting outdoors and enjoying the dazzling surroundings. I joined a cycling tour and rode through the vanilla plantations and towering palm trees. Exploring the area with a local brings it to life, so I’d highly recommend connecting with a guide.Despite being a small island, La Digue has some great tour companies with highly knowledgeable guides.You can learn about the flora and fauna of the island while you explore the panoramic views from the top of the island. There are options for all kinds of interests– biking, walking, kayaking, and rock climbing tours to name a few.Surfing is also popular on the islands, and there are lots of opportunities to sign up for some surfing lessons around La Digue; it’s an idyllic spot to learn.The sunset, sunrise, and full moon tours are especially amazing.Anse Source D’Argent beach is one of the most photographed beaches in the world, and it is an absolute must-see. To get to the beach, you’ll have to pay an entrance fee at the L’Union Estate (100 SCR or $7 USD) which also allows you to explore the park– there, you can find a museum, old coconut mills and giant tortoises!Before you leave, be sure to visit some of the small shops in La Passe area to find a souvenir. You’ll find tons of tropical-style jewelry, and you can also get incredibly beautiful black pearls.For the ultimate Seychellois souvenir, you can find shops around the islands that sell Coco de Mer nuts. I bought mine on Praslin Island. Just make sure someone at the shop organizes an export permit for you!Top Things to Do:Anse Source D’Argent & Grand Anse BeachesVanilla PlantationSnorkeling, Diving, Surfing & KayakingBike ToursWhere to Stay on La DigueDespite its relatively tiny size, there are lots of accommodation options around La Digue Island. I only visited the island on a day trip, but here are a few of the top-rated spots:Le Domaine de L’Orangeraie: the perfect blend of tropical style meets modern chic, these airy villas are the top luxury pick.Casa De Leela: set in the center of town, this place has just three self-catering bungalows and four apartments tucked away in a lush tropical garden.Chateau St Cloud: nestled in the foothills of Eagle’s Nest Mountain, this colonial-era villa has a beautiful garden, a sparkling pool, and spacious rooms.There are lots of guesthouse options on the island too. Many of them offer bicycles and homemade creole food. Here are some top-rated guesthouses:Chloé’s Cottage: just between Grand Anse beach and the famous Anse Source d’Argent, there are two self-contained apartments that are ideal for a quiet escape.Pension Socrate: for a cheap and cheery pick, you can’t go wrong with this quaint little guesthouse.Beryl’s Guesthouse: for a quiet house with tasty Seychellois creole food, this is a prime pick close to the beach.A big thank you to The Seychelles Islands for hosting me during my time in the Seychelles.

https://theblondeabroad.com/a-guide-to-cousin-island-in-the-seychelles/,A Guide to Cousin Island in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"One of the eco-friendliest places on the planet, Cousin Island is a must-see for any Seychelles visitor. Located just one mile off of Praslin Island, this place has lush mangroves, dense forests, freshwater swamps, a rocky coastline, and beautiful sandy beaches.Cousin Island became the first “sea and island reserve” in the Indian Ocean after it was purchased and converted from a coconut plantation in the 1960s. Overseen by Nature Seychelles and protected by the local government, this nature reserve is heaven for animal lovers and eco-travelers.Here’s what you need to know about Cousin Island in the Seychelles!What to Expect on Cousin IslandOnce a coconut plantation, Cousin Island was created to save the Seychelles Warbler, a small local songbird that was nearly extinct. Thanks to its planning and funding from eco-tourism, Cousin Island is now a safe refuge for countless birds.In my opinion, a few hours is ample time to explore. The island is only 0.13 square miles.The island only receives about 10,000 visitors a year! So, it is relatively less-traveled than other islands in the Seychelles. You won’t find any accommodation, restaurants, or even trash cans on the island in efforts to minimize waste and preserve the pristine environment.When you are arriving, you won’t dock on the shores of Cousin Island. Since this place is an essential refuge for so many animals, the Nature Seychelles conservationists are very careful to keep the wildlife safe. This means that you’ll be ferried over to the island on a smaller boat to make sure that there aren’t any pests hopping off your boat with you.Visitors 12 years old and up will need to pay an entrance fee of SR500 ($37 USD), which goes towards the maintenance of the Reserve.Helpful Tip: Make sure you bring water, mosquito repellent, and sun block as these are not available to buy on the island. The mosquitos are crazy on Cousin Island, so come prepared (they were the worst here than on any other island I visited!). I recommend wearing something pretty full coverage, like a maxi dress, scarf, or something else lightweight that’ll give you a layer over your skin. Read More: The Best Time to Travel to the Seychelles What to Do on Cousin IslandA visit to Cousin Island is all about wandering around and taking in the local wildlife. There are birds everywhere you look here! You’ll likely get to see Seychelles sunbirds and fairy terns as well as giant tortoises and lizards. With a bit of luck, you might stumble across a turtle laying eggs.It’s paradise for bird watchers!The Cousin Island Special Reserve is only open in the mornings from Monday to Friday, so come organized and plan to get there early in the day. Cousin Island tour companies operate from nine thirty until twelve thirty, and they are closed on public holidays.The actual nature reserve on Cousin Island doesn’t organize trips, so you’ll want to go with a private company. They are easy to find when you are staying on Praslin Island.The majority of the hotels on Praslin offer their own tours or work with a local charter company. If you opt for an island-hopping tour, it will often include a trip to Cousin Island in the itinerary too. I visited Cousin Island during my Seychelles cruise onboard the Crystal Esprit!Cousin Island is a great example of why the Seychelles is one of the few pristine places on Earth.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-the-hilton-seychelles-labriz-resort-spa/,Staying at the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa,Seychelles,"Do you love empty white-sand beaches surrounded by paths that wind through lush tropical forests? Of course you do! And so do I. That’s why staying in a five-star resort in the Seychelles was a dream come true for me.With stunning colonial-inspired villas, the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa on Silhouette Island is a beachfront resort with all that you’d expect from a luxury property (and then some).Planning your own tropical escape?Here’s everything you’ll want to know about staying at the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa.The HotelLocated about twelve miles northwest of Mahé, Silhouette Island has a dynamic history. Before the Hilton Labriz arrived there, it was home to pirates and plantation workers. 125-year-old giant tortoises roamed the island, and the land was thick with incense trees.While Silhouette Island is now home to a luxury resort, not much has changed (except you probably won’t run into any pirates these days).In fact, more than 92 percent of the island is officially protected by the Seychelles government to preserve the native flora and fauna. The Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa is pretty much the only touristy site on the island—and that’s a very good thing.The hotel is perfectly maintained and has integrated into the local environment.Tucked away within the coves and gardens of Silhouette Island are amazing restaurants, a dive center, a spa, a fitness center, a tennis court, a Jacuzzi, a hammam, a freshwater lagoon, a kids’ club, and beach equipment rentals.Helpful Tip: You can arrive at the resort in style via a scenic 15-minute helicopter ride from Seychelles International Airport on Mahé, or a 45-minute boat trip operated by the resort!The RoomsThe Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa offers one- and two-bedroom villas. In your tropical home away from home, you will have all of your tech essentials like fast, free Wi-Fi and oversized flat screens along with gorgeous terraces to lounge on and enjoy the beautiful view.Upgraded villas feature gazebos, private pools, and butler service.Whatever villa you choose, all of the options at this Hilton are gorgeous. Every villa has an island chic vibe with a Creole-style roof and a modern entertainment system.One of my fave perks is the oversized bathroom with dual sinks, a huge jetted bathtub, and an outdoor rain shower. It is a dream bathroom for a DIY spa day, which is an essential of any lazy beach vacation.The FoodYou’ll never go hungry at the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort & Spa. It has a continental buffet, authentic Italian food, incredible Japanese cuisine, Créole specialities, and tons of other international and local options.Start your day with the fresh breakfast options at Café Dauban, grab a poolside charcuterie selection or cheese platter, and then watch the sun set while you sip on island-inspired cocktails on the beach.Treat yourself to dinner at one of the posh restaurants or indulge poolside; you can even have room service bring it right to you. There is an expansive menu that suits any taste, and it’s really great with veggie offers and other dietary restrictions.I also got the opportunity to take a cooking class with the resort chefs, and made some delicious, local specialties.Yum!Activities on Silhouette IslandJust because Silhouette Island is quiet doesn’t mean it’s boring—just the opposite in fact! It has everything you could ever want from a beach getaway.The scuba diving is great, and the Hilton Seychelles Labriz has a five-star certified PADI diving center. Honestly, the diving wasn’t the best I’ve experienced, but it was fun to explore. If you prefer to stay closer to the shore, snorkeling is also available.You’ll also definitely want to try your hand at fishing the tropical shores.On land, you can work up a sweat at the fitness center or tennis courts and then explore the lush jungles. And, if you’re bringing little ones, this place has you covered with an impressive kids’ club.In My OpinionLabriz offers a unique experience in the Seychelles. The beach here is out of this world! It’s definitely more of a resort vibe, with lots of restaurants options and a beautiful pool area. You can still find seclusion in your room and at the spa. The spa here was my favorite in all of the Seychelles.More InformationHotel: Hilton Seychelles LabrizLocation: Silhouette Island, SeychellesAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$Thank you to Hilton Seychelles Labriz for hosting me during my stay.

I was so excited to explore the picture-perfect islands and dive below the crystal-clear, turquoise waters.When I was finally able to make the trip, let me tell you, I was not disappointed. I arrived to the dreamy destination on Air Seychelles, and spent a week exploring the islands of Mahé and Praslin, along with Silhouette Island. I stayed at the Hilton Seychelles Northolme Resort & Spa, as well as the Hilton Seychelles Labriz Resort, which I would highly recommend.Following those adventures, I was lucky enough to spend another week onboard the Crystal Esprit Yacht to explore more of the Seychelles. We visited less-traveled islands like Sainte Anne Island, Cousin Island, Aride Island and even Big Sister private island. We also visited La Digue, which is one one of the three, main inhabited (and visited) islands.Besides the beaches, one of the biggest highlights of the trip was hiking to the peak of Aride Island while sailing with Crystal Esprit, and looking out upon the endless sapphire sea. At one point, our guide called out into the distance, and all of a sudden hundreds of frigate birds went sailing into the horizon. We sat for nearly 20 minutes completely awestruck by the countless birds sailing before us.I couldn’t sum up my experience better than to say, the Seychelles Islands are paradise.A big thank you to The Seychelles Islands for hosting me during my time in the Seychelles.

https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-seychelles-with-herbal-essences-biorenew-collection/,Exploring The Seychelles with Herbal Essences’ bio:renew Collection,Seychelles,"This post was written in partnership with P&G as their newest Herbal Essences brand ambassador. As always, all thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own.I’ve been a long time fan of Herbal Essences so, of course, I jumped at the chance to be a brand ambassador for the new Herbal Essences’ bio:renew Collection.At the minute, I’m working my way through each collection to find my favorites. I brought the Herbal Essences’ bio:renew Coconut Milk Collection with me on my recent trip to the Seychelles to see how it could stand up to the heat and humidity of the islands.Before we dive into the Coconut Milk Collection, let me give you a quick overview of the entire Herbal Essences’ bio:renew collection. First of all, what I like the most about bio:renew is the fact that it’s free of parabens, gluten, and colorants. Every bio:renew collection is made with a signature blend of aloe, sea kelp, and antioxidants.For me, the highlight is that Herbal Essences includes an antioxidant called histidine. It protects your hair from damaging elements when you wash your hair. Traveling through polluted cities, swimming in chlorinated water, lying under the sun, and generally just giving my hair a beating when I’m traveling, I try to do as much as I can prevent damage.Like other Herbal Essences collections, you’re can customize your bio:renew pick to your hair type. With collections that hydrate, repair, and add volume, there’s really something for everyone here.And the smells are incredible!Coconut Milk CollectionSeychelles is a beach lover’s dream and I spent a good amount on my time there exploring the shores and diving. While it was great for my tan, it wasn’t so great for my hair. The Herbal Essences’ bio:renew Coconut Milk Collection was perfect for giving my hair a boost of hydration.The shampoo rinses away all of the sand, salt, and chlorine while the conditioner replenishes parched locks. The bio:renew Coconut Milk Oil-Infused Crème is another beach bag essential. It’ll give you instantaneous hydration, super shine, and that oh-so-important frizz protection.Helpful Tip: Before you dive into the swimming pool or ocean, wet your hair and saturate it with conditioner. This will prevent your hair from taking in chlorine and other harmful chemicals.Remember, your hair is basically like a sponge. If you fill it up with good stuff until it’s totally soaked, then it won’t be able to absorb any of the bad stuff.And, ladies: embrace beach hair!When you’re in and out of the water, it’s impossible to keep slick, shiny locks so just go with it. Rather than trying to create a chic style, opt for a hydrated, cool messy ‘do.Stay tuned for more of my adventures around the world with Herbal Essences this year!"

https://theblondeabroad.com/exploring-praslin-island-in-the-seychelles/,A Guide to Praslin Island in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"One of my favorite stops on my travels around the Seychelles was Praslin Island. And I’m not alone in loving it! This place is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful destinations on the planet, and one of the most traveled islands in the archipelago.With stunning beaches, emerald waters, and lush jungles, the second largest island of Seychelles is insanely gorgeous.Here’s my guide to Praslin Island in the Seychelles!Getting To & Around PraslinGetting There: Jumping between islands in the Seychelles is pretty easy– you can choose from ferries or flights. There are speed ferries that run between the main island, Mahé, and Praslin (with onward connections to La Digue), that take about 50 minutes. A flight from Mahé to Praslin will cost a bit more, however, it will only be about 15 minutes (I opted for the flight!).Helpful Tip: During peak season, you could end up spending hours at the airport, depending on flight schedules and availability, so always be sure to book ahead.Getting Around: Praslin Island is less than fifteen square miles, so it’s easy to navigate. The local bus is a cheap and efficient way to go anywhere. It runs from five a.m. to nine p.m. on most routes. Many people on the island speak English (some even as a first language), so it’s simple to ask for directions and find your way around.To get to more far-flung spots or to travel at night, taxis are a great solution. All of the taxis have been standardized by the Seychelles government, so every company charges the same rates. It’s important to know, however, that many taxis won’t accept luggage.The same goes for buses. If you have anything bigger than a carry-on, plan well in advance.One of the best ways to get around Praslin Island is by bike. Many hotels rent bicycles, and it’s something I’d recommend. There are so many gorgeous pathways and it’s a lovely way to see the island.You can also rent a car to get around Praslin Island. Having your own ride is handy for getting to some of the secluded spots, but, since the island is so small, renting a car is definitely something that you will want to organize ahead of time.Helpful Tip: I wouldn’t recommend bringing a ton of luggage with you. It’ll be harder to get around, and even Air Seychelles has hard limits on luggage weights. Fortunately, the weather is always warm and sunny, so you really won’t need much more than beachwear.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to the Seychelles What to Do on Praslin IslandAnse Lazio beach is an absolute must-see when you are traveling in the Seychelles Islands. With plush white sand and turquoise water, this is the most impressive beach you’ll find anywhere.Despite being voted as the world’s most beautiful countless times, Anse Lazio beach isn’t too crowded. You’ll easily find your own place in the sun, and it’s worth spending at least one afternoon there.Be sure to bring your snorkeling gear! You can snorkel right off of the shores.Once you are ready to take to the sea, there are boat charters that’ll bring you deep-sea fishing and give you an incredible view. There are also some inner-islands excursions that’ll take you out for some snorkeling and a BBQ.Ready to live it up in style?A helicopter ride will give you an unforgettable view of the Seychelles. There are tours that’ll fly you along the coastline and over the mountains. A helicopter is also a handy way to do some island hopping.Another idyllic way to spend the day is golfing among the lush vegetation with views of the sea below. Whether you are a pro or total newbie, the weather and scenery is just too perfect to pass it up. I heard from a couple that the golf course here had one of the best views they’ve seen in the entire world.Top Things to Do:Vallée de Mai Nature ReserveFond Ferdinand Nature ReservePraslin National ParkBeach, beach, beachGolfingCurieuse IslandBest Beaches:Anse LazioAnse GeorgetteAnse VolbertAnse ConsolationCote d’Or BeachBest Restaurants:Café des ArtsLes Lauriers BuffetLa PiroguePK’s @ Pasquière & GastropubBonbon PlumeCoco RougeLes RochersVillage du PecheurBreeze GardenVallée de Mai Nature ReserveWhat makes Praslin such a remarkable place is the Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve.

With all of the incredible natural beauty in the Seychelles, this place stands out as a must-see.If you’re interested in bringing a Coco de Mer back with you, check out my tips on buying a Coco de Mer in the Seychelles!Back on Mahé Island, you can find some at the Victoria Market and also at the Botanical Gardens. Be prepared to pay cash, and only buy certified nuts with an export license.With all the attractions and beautiful natural sites, it’s no wonder that Praslin in the most-visited island in the Seychelles.

https://theblondeabroad.com/a-guide-to-mahe-island-in-the-seychelles/,A Guide to Mahé Island in the Seychelles,Seychelles,"Located almost 1,000 miles off of mainland East Africa, the Seychelles has always been a dream destination of mine. With pristine white-sand beaches, lush forests, and dramatic mountains, this place is a true tropical paradise. I was lucky enough to explore Mahé for a few days at the beginning and end of my cruise on the Crystal Esprit.Mahé is the largest island of the Seychelles and the first stop for most visitors.With exotic trees lining the beaches for miles, this place is a beach lover’s heaven. And there’s no shortage of natural beauty in any direction. The island is full of picture-perfect coconut plantations and empty beaches with granite peaks framing it all. It’s almost too beautiful for words.Here’s my guide to Mahé Island in the Seychelles!What to ExpectMahé is home to ninety percent of the population in the Seychelles. The country has fewer than 90,000 citizens though, so it’s far from a hectic city landscape. In fact, the Seychelles’ capital, Victoria, is one of the smallest capital cities in the world.This area was settled by Arab sailors, British colonialists, French settlers, Tamil and Chinese traders, and African slaves. Of course, this created a dynamic cultural mashup that is unlike what you’ll find anywhere else.For such an isolated country, the Seychelles has a unique creole culture that blends a wide range of influences.Mahé is also closest to Praslin and La Digue Islands, and you can easily get between them on short ferry rides or island hopper flights.Read More: The Best Time to Travel to the Seychelles What to Do on Mahé IslandYou could spend your entire Seychelles escape just lounging on the beaches. There are immaculate white-sand beaches all over the islands, and the weather is ideal pretty much every day of the year.When you are ready to look beyond the shores, there are adventure companies all over Mahé that’ll offer you an incredible day out. Go rock climbing, kayaking, or scuba diving, or scale the granite rocks. Any of the adventure companies around the island will get you set up with all of the equipment that you need for a fun day out.Mahé is also home to Morne Seychellois National Park and offers tons of outdoor activities and hiking trails for those who want to get some of the best views over the island.If you’re a fish lover, you’ll want to try the famous tuna from right off the shores of Mahé Island.The city of Victoria is a good place to get a better idea of the Seychellois life. While you’re there, I recommend you check out Victoria Market. It’s a good spot to grab souvenirs and some ultrafresh seafood.Besides the city of Victoria, other areas of the island include Northolme, where I stayed for a night, as well as Eden Island. Eden Island is part of Mahé Island, and is home to Eden Plaza which has restaurants and shops you can explore– it’s an up-and-coming hotspot!Top Things to Do:Snorkeling & DivingMorne Blanc TrailSeychelles National Botanical GardensAnse Major Hiking TrailVictoria MarketHop a SailboatBest Beaches:Anse SolielBeau VallonAnse RoyalePetite AnseGetting Around Mahé IslandWhile Mahé is the largest island in the Seychelles, it’s still only four miles wide and sixteen miles long, so it is easy to get around and see it all. Whether you take the bus, walk, or grab a cab, it’s all pretty straightforward.Beware of traffic during certain times in the day! Always check travel times in you’re on a schedule, since the island roads can get congested.You’ll see blue buses on all of the streets, and they are a cheap and easy transport option. For less than 5 Seychellois Rupees, or 40 cents, you can go anywhere on the island. It’s far from luxe travel, but it’s a good way to get a glimpse at everyday life in the Seychelles while getting where you need to go.Just be sure to have small change handy, and don’t be shy about asking locals for directions.Mahé Island is full of taxis too. They’re great for quick trips or a full-day tour of the island. Depending on where you are going, a taxi boat can be a good option as well.Hilton Seychelles NortholmeWhere to Stay on Mahé IslandYou’ll find ample luxury choices in Mahé Island including Banyan Tree Seychelles, Four Seasons Resort Seychelles, and Kempinski Seychelles Resort. They’re all international standard and just what you’d expect from a five-star hotel.I stayed at the Hilton Seychelles Northolme Resort & Spa for a few days and would definitely recommend it. It is actually the smallest Hilton hotel in the world and, quite possibly, one of the most picturesque properties I’ve ever seen! It’s a prime midrange option with luxury perks.Eden Bleu HotelThe night before boarding the Crystal Esprit yacht for a Seychelles cruise, I stayed at the Eden Bleu Hotel. I’d definitely recommend staying here, or around the Eden Plaza area.A big thank you to The Seychelles Islands for hosting me during my time in the Seychelles.

This is actually my second time sailing with Crystal Cruises only– the first was over New Years 2015 when I took my mom aboard the Crystal Symphony for her first international trip! This time, I was even more blown away. Crystal Cruises is truly the ultimate in luxury & adventure travel.Not only does the Esprit yacht feature luxury staterooms and all-inclusive Michelin-level dining, guests can kayak, snorkel, paddle board, jet ski and dive down on the yacht’s personal submarine. Here’s a little more about my 9-day Seychelles cruise and all of the amazing stops we had along the way!Boarding the Crystal Esprit Yacht in the SeychellesDay 1: Victoria, MahéMahé is the largest of the 115 Seychelles islands and has a stunning capital city, Victoria. The city is quaint and has somewhat limited activities, but you’ll be blown away by the historical architecture and local culture.On Mahé, exotic trees line up along the white sand beaches for miles and miles. There are also tons of coconut plantations and empty beaches, all surrounded by distinguished granite peaks.There’s no shortage of natural beauty!The night before boarding the Crystal Esprit yacht, I stayed at the Eden Bleu Hotel which is located right at the marina.

Historically, the island was a commercial whaling outpost, but now the island is part of the Sainte Anne Marine National Park, and offers peace and quiet for visitors to experience nature and wildlife.Read More: Exploring Sainte Anne Island in the SeychellesSand Bar at Sainte Anne IslandCousin IslandDay 3: Cousin IslandCousin Island is about a mile from Praslin, and one of the most eco-friendly islands you can visit. The island is Special Nature Reserve protected under Seychelles law, and overseen by Nature Seychelles, a national nonprofit organization.And due to conservation efforts, there are SO many birds. Everywhere.Cousin Island is such a paradise for nature lovers. You’ll find mangroves, dense forests, freshwater swamps, a rocky southern coast, and sandy beaches all around. Crystal Cruises also offers a birdwatching shore excursion at this port, and I’d highly recommend it. You’ll see countless land and seabirds as well as giant tortoises.(Just don’t forget your mosquito repellent — they’re really bad here!)Read More: A Guide to Cousin Island in the SeychellesBaby bird on Cousin IslandAnse Lazio BeachDay 4: Praslin IslandPraslin, the second largest island of the Seychelles, has a lot to offer visitors– it was definitely one of my favorite stops. The island has stunning beaches, like Anse Lazio, emerald waters, and overgrown jungles.What makes Praslin one of the most unique islands is that it’s home to Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve.This protected forest is full of rare fauna, and most famously the endemic coco de mer palm– a tree that produces the world’s largest seed and palm flower. This seed, or “double coconut”, takes 7 years to grow while the tree takes 50 years to mature!The reserve is one of Seychelles’ two UNESCO World Heritage Sites and has been nicknamed the Garden of Eden. I joined the excursion to Vallée de Mai and Anse Lazio beach and would highly recommend it. Other excursions include helicopter rides, deep sea fishing, and golf.(Other guests that opted in for golfing said it had some of the best views of any golf course they’ve ever seen!)Read More: A Guide to Praslin Island in the SeychellesVallée de Mai Nature ReserveVisiting La DigueDay 5: La Digue IslandIf you’re looking to get off the grid and live on “island time” then La Digue is your destination. It is the third largest inhabited island of the Seychelles in terms of population, but you wouldn’t even realize. The island is purely dirt roads with very few cars, and such stunning natural beauty.I fell in love with the gorgeous bays, granite rocks, turquoise water, and the vibrant coral reefs.I joined the cycling tour and rode through vanilla plantations and towering palm trees on my way to Anse Source D’Argent beach — one of the most photographed beaches in the world!Read More: A Guide to La Digue Island in the SeychellesCycling through Vanilla PlantationsCrystal Esprit SubmersibleDay 6: Laraie Bay, Curieuse IslandJust sailing into Laraie Bay on Curieuse Island was an amazing experience. The harbor is filled with hundreds of giant parrotfish, and the landscape is breathtaking.In addition to Praslin, coco de mer palms grow on Curieuse as well.There’s such lush vegetation, and takamaka trees, hanging out over the red sand beaches. The island is also known for its giant tortoises, which took me back to memories of my Galápagos cruise. Native to many Seychelles islands, the tortoise had once been almost extinct, but thanks to a conservation program, they have been reintroduced to the island.Today, you can see tortoises roaming freely!This is the day that Crystal Esprit normally takes out their submersible, so be sure to sign up in advance to reserve your spot. The Crystal Esprit is the only passenger yacht with a submersible in the world and it’s a once in a lifetime experience.Aside from a spin in the submersible, you can also head to the beach for snorkeling and paddle boarding. In the evening, all guests are invited back to the island for a “Fun in the Sun” social hour with champagne and caviar on the beach, compliments of Crystal Esprit.When we returned to the yacht, the swim deck was set up for swimming off the back of the ship. It was such a special treat and one of my favorite days on the trip!Crystal Esprit Champagne and Caviar Social HourBird viewpoint on Aride IslandDay 7: Aride Island & Big Sister IslandIf you are a bird lover, then you’ll love Aride Island. The island is one of most important seabird habitats in the Indian Ocean, and there are more species there than on any other island in Seychelles.But, you’ll be surprised to know that the island is very small, only 1 mile long, and the population consists only of rangers, conservation officers and volunteers.Make sure to schedule a nature hike!Crystal Esprit offers a stroll, but if you’re capable, opt in for the hike. It’s a somewhat steep climb but the view from the top is absolutely breathtaking. This was actually my favorite experience on the entire cruise! Once we reached the outlook, our guide called out into the distance, and hundreds of frigate birds went sailing into the horizon.We sat for nearly 20 minutes completely awestruck by the countless birds sailing before us. Big Sister Island is not actually on the itinerary because it is only reachable in ideal conditions. Luckily, we had a day of perfect weather and were able to spend the afternoon there. Big Sister is a private island and is home to my favorite beach in all of the Seychelles — the sand was light pink and was as soft as baby powder.Need I say more?!Big Sister Private Island in the SeychellesVictoria MarketDay 9: Back to MahéBefore disembarking, we spent our last day back on Mahé. You’ll have the option to join a tour of Victoria Market and the Botanical Gardens. [TIP: If you have your heart set on purchasing a Coco de Mer to bring home, the Botanical Gardens have them for sale.]While saying goodbye to the Crystal Esprit is hard, it’s a great way to end an unforgettable experience.Read More: The Ultimate Seychelles Travel GuideA big thank you to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my time onboard.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-berns-hotel-in-stockholm/,Staying at Berns Hotel in Stockholm,Sweden,"Stockholm is a big city but has such a unique charm—comprised of colorful buildings surrounded by the sea, world-class restaurants and designers—it is unlike anything else in Europe. The capital city has a peacefulness about it, and incredible Scandinavian history and culture.With countless things to do, places to eat, and hotels to stay at, Stockholm is an incredible city to explore. During my last visit to Stockholm, I stayed at the Berns Hotel and cannot recommend it enough!Here’s my experience of staying at the Berns Hotel in Stockholm!Berns HotelOpening its doors in 1989, the Berns Hotel architects were inspired by large cities like as Milan and New York. When the hotel was initially built 30 years ago, it only housed 65 rooms.Over the years it has attracted the attention of famous international travelers and eventually expanded to the 82 rooms that there are today.One of my favorite aspects of the hotel is their attention to sustainability. They have chosen to partner up with international eco-label Green Key and must meet specific sustainability standards to be considered a partner.Overall it’s an eat, sleep, party kind of hotel. There are two nightclubs, two restaurants, and 4 bars (including a VIP-only bar) on the property, so people definitely come here to have a good time. The Rooms at Berns HotelAs I mentioned, there are now 82 boutique suites total, all very eclectic. You have quite a few options when choosing the kind of room you want, as there are 8 total. They include:Standard SingleStandard DoubleSuperiorDeluxeDeluxe BalconySuiteRobert Berns SuiteClock SuiteAll the rooms include modern touches, free WiFi, a minibar, and a very comfy bed. If you want the VIP experience, you’ll want to stay the Robert Berns Suite or the Clock Suite.I stayed in the Robert Berns Suite (which is more like an apartment). Celebrities like Lady Gaga, Beyonce and more have stayed here!   Food & DrinkAt Berns, you can sip on your morning coffee under chandeliers, drink cocktails in the Mirror Bar, and enjoy brunch while living like royalty in red velvet armchairs. There are two restaurants for you to enjoy.At Berns Asiatiska, you can enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It was the first Chinese restaurant in Sweden, opened in 1944. The restaurant is extremely popular with locals and tourists alike—aside from the great food, the restaurant itself is beautiful, finished with chandeliers.The second food option, though not located at the hotel, is right next door. Calle P consists of a dining room, bar, and outdoor seating area where you can enjoy menu items like duck, sea bass, pork, and more.If you want a cocktail, Bar 606 is one of Stockholm’s VIP spots, and also a stunning, rooftop spot. It is only open during the summer months when the weather is warmer. The Nightlife at Berns HotelAlright, alright. So you probably want to hear about the party now, right? The Berns Hotel has done an incredible job of marketing itself as a hotspot for nightlife.It has two night clubs, NEU and LE!. NEU focuses on EDM and laser effects and can be visited by anyone 23 and older Friday and Saturday from midnight to 5 AM.LE! on the other hand, is a two-story lively bar with plenty of music and an outrageous sound system. It is also 23 and older on Friday and Saturday from 11 PM to 4 AM.Both nightclubs have been known to house big-name artists that have put on some pretty huge performances.    AmenitiesWith your stay at Berns Hotel, your amenities include:Room serviceAn in-room bartenderA minibarComplimentary daily newspapersA water kettleA TV with Netflix, HBO, Spotify, etc.Free WiFiFree magazines OverallWhile you may not think of Stockholm as the place to experience an up and coming nightlife scene, a stay at the Berns Hotel will change your mind in no time. And you can’t forget about the delicious restaurants and proximity to all that there is to see and do in the giant city!More InformationHotel: Berns HotelLocation: Stockholm, SwedenAccommodation: BoutiquePrice Range: $$$ Have you ever stayed at Berns Hotel in Stockholm?Want to earn points for your hotel stays and earn miles toward your next adventure?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/tips-for-exploring-sodermalm-stockholm/,Tips for Exploring Södermalm in Stockholm,Sweden,"The Swedish capital, Stockholm, is one of my favorite European cities. This gem of the north is a natural beauty with remarkable architecture and dynamic culture—even their subway system is an absolute work of art!In the heart of Stockholm, you will find the ultra-hip Södermalm neighborhood. As with most “cool” neighborhoods, the intrigue comes from a history of transformation. Way back in the 1500s, Södermalm was an incredibly poor area and only recently made its way to even becoming a working-class neighborhood.In the past century, it’s become a hipster hotspot. Home to an endless array of quirky shops, cool cafes, and trendy bars, this is the place to be in the city!Södermalm is located just south of the city’s Old Town (Gamla Stan). It is easy to get to by car or with Stockholm’s extensive public transport network of buses, trams, and metros.Ready to see what makes this Swedish city so special? Here are my tips for exploring Södermalm in Stockholm!   Take a Private TourIf you’re visiting Södermalm with limited time, the best way to see the neighborhood is to go on a private tour. I had an incredible experience with a Tina, a local from Context Travel, who is one of their guides for the Södermalm – Hidden Paths & Hipster Headquarters tour.It’s a three-hour adventure that takes you to all of the hidden nooks and crannies around the city. We saw so many cool little shops and cafes that I would have never noticed on my own!The thing that I love about private tours is that you can learn so much when you have an expert there to answer all of your questions—Tina not only knew all of the modern hotspots but the entire long history of Södermalm because she’s lived there for many years.We even stopped for a fika break at her favorite coffee spot—yum!   Explore the NeighborhoodsSödermalm, AKA Söder (which means the South in Swedish), is made up of a few different areas.SoFo: In the blocks south of Folkungagatan, you’ll find an interesting, creative, and chic Södermalm scene. You’ll find some popular cafes like Cafe String and Kafe Rang, as well as beautiful shops like Grandpa, plus designers and lots of restaurants—Nytorget Urban Deli and Nytorget 6 being the most popular.Skanstull: Skanstull is one of the biggest areas of Södermalm, and it’s the ideal place to go shopping and grab a bite. Home to the Ringen mall, you’ll find all the brand name shops and a food hall here. It may not be the most scenic, but there’s a lot to do.Slussen: Slussen has a big international community, and you’ll find a lot of interesting events held in the area. Surprisingly, the McDonald’s in this neighborhood actually has one of the best views in town! Slussen is a big transportation hub, so you’ll find a metro stop very central here. It’s also home to the Fotografiska museum.Mariatorget: Mariatorget is a lovely area and one of the wealthiest in Stockholm. Be sure to bring your camera for a stroll down the Monteliusvägen path.Hornstull: The area of Hornstull is an up-and-coming area of Stockholm, but down along the Hornstull Strand, you’ll find the Hornstull Marknad, a massive outdoor flea market, and food truck scene. The market runs every Saturday & Sunday from April until the end of September!Read More: Guide to Stockholm’s Subway Art   Monteliusvägen ViewpointFind the Best ViewThe quarter of a mile long path running along the northern end of Södermalm is known as the Monteliusvägen walking path. From here, you will get an incredible view of the prime sites like Lake Mälaren, City Hall, and Riddarholmen! I would highly recommend planning your day so you can walk along the path at sunset or sunrise for an unforgettable view of Stockholm.The Katarina Elevator is another must-visit vantage point. The elevator has been closed lately, but you can still climb the stairs up. From there, go onto the terrace, and you will get a sweeping view of Gamla Stan!Read More: Staying at Berns Hotel in Stockholm   Visit a Unique MuseumI adored Fotografiska, which is a hip photography museum displaying the unique perspectives of top photographers in their constantly changing schedule of exhibitions.

Meatballs for the People is an iconic eatery that serves up the best traditional Swedish meatball plates.Pelikan is a swanky old school beer hall that offers an array of traditional Scandinavian dishes and beer.For Vegetarians and Vegans:It’s not all about the meatballs though! For veg lovers like yours truly, you will find great vegetarian options at Hermans Trädgårdscafé. Stop by for lunch between 11 am to 3 pm for a primo vegan and vegetarian buffet.They do get busy though so I’d recommend coming on the earlier or later side to avoid the rush and give yourself time to take in the striking view. And it’s all you can eat, for about $20 USD, so come hungry!Chutney is ultra popular with local vegetarians and vegans. They serve up a pan-Asian-inspired menu that is seriously impressive.

https://theblondeabroad.com/guide-to-stockholms-subway-art/,Guide to Stockholm’s Subway Art,Sweden,"With a history of over 750 years, Stockholm is a fascinating European destination. It’s restaurants whip up inventive dishes, there are beautiful parks to explore, and the city has an incredible art scene – in the subway.It’s easy to spend an entire week exploring the city’s unique urban gallery with more than 90 decorated subway stations. I’ve narrowed it down to nine of my favorites that showcase some of the best art there is to see.Here’s my guide to Stockholm’s subway art!   T-Centralen StationHistoryStockholm’s subway art is the world’s longest art exhibit. Stretching over 110 kilometers, 90 out of the 100 stations are decorated with colorful pieces of art.It all started in the 1950s when the city decided to make art more accessible to its citizens and beautify urban areas. Since then, more than 150 Swedish artists have contributed pieces to Stockholm’s stations.   Stadion StationTips for Visiting Stockholm’s Subway ArtTickets: If you’re going to be using the subway frequently during your time in Stockholm, get an SL Access card (SEK 20 / $2) and top it up with unlimited travel for 75 minutes, 24-hours or 72-hours.HELPFUL TIP: If you are only going to the subway to take photos, you can be strategic and get a 75-minute ticket for only SEK 44 / $5. It’s valid for unlimited travel on all public transportation, so you can switch lines and hop around to each station.Best Time to Go: The best time to go on a self-guided tour of Stockholm’s subway art is during the week around 12 pm. You’ll miss rush hour, and you’ll have an easier time getting a photo without anyone else around. If you’re busy during the day, you can also try in the evenings. The stations are open until 12:30 am every day.Photography: It’s easy to take photos of Stockholm’s subway art with any camera or smartphone. But if you want to get the best results, I recommend bringing along a tripod because you’ll need to use a slow shutter speed (there’s no natural light down there!). Check out my photography gear here!    Mörby CentrumStockholm Subway Art ItineraryT-Centralen: Opened in 1957, the T-Centralen become the first station in Stockholm to feature artwork. Designed by local artist, Per Olof Ultvedt, it features beautiful blue vines climbing up the walls and pays homage to the workers who built the subway.Stadion: Located near the home of Stockholm’s annual Pride festival, Stadion is decorated with a vivid and colorful rainbow. It became the first of the city’s “cave” stations and is carved straight out of the bedrock.Tekniska Hogskolan: Created by Lennart Mork, the station is inspired by the nearby Royal Institute of Technology. It’s has a dark, moody undertone and features interesting elements from science like a giant glass polyhedron.Universitetet Station: The Universitet Station is the ultimate subway stop for travelers. Its main feature is a massive tile panel detailing the travels of Carl Linnaeus. A famous Swede who is considered the father of modern taxonomy of organisms.Thorildsplan Station: Ever wanted to be a character in a Super Mario Nintendo game? Head over to the Thorildsplan Station. Local artist Lars Arrhenius used tiles to create 8-bit video game art. Keep an eye out for Space Invaders, Pacman and more!  Hallonbergen StationSolna Centrum: (Blue Line) Created in 1975, the Solna Centrum station features a bright red sun setting behind a lush green Swedish forest. It features hundreds of free-handed drawings depicting political issues like deforestation, global warming, and urbanization.Hallonbergen: The Hallonbergen station is one of the most whimsical subways in Stockholm. Local artists Elis Eriksson and Gosta Wallmark decorated the subway with drawings from the childhood. There’s also a rainbow escalator – making it one of the most Instagrammable spots in the city!Radhuset: Located below the city’s Court House, the artist wanted Radhuset to look like an underground grotto. You’ll find intricate details like a medieval market, a plinth of a chimney and metal shoes on the ceiling. There are lots of exciting things to see, so give yourself time to discover some hidden gems before leaving the station.Mörby Centrum: As you walk into Mörby Centrum, you will see with rather dull looking walls. While the station doesn’t seem impressive at first glance, it’s all an optical illusion. Head to the center of the boarding platform, and the walls shift colors, depicting a pastel geometric rainbow (complete with cotton candy colored clouds).Read More: Visiting Gröna Lund in Stockholm   Solna Centrum StationOverallWhether you’re spending a day, a week or a month in the city – you need to visit Stockholm’s subway art.

https://theblondeabroad.com/5-things-you-need-to-experience-in-stockholm/,5 Things You Need to Experience in Stockholm,Sweden,"Are you heading to Stockholm for an extended visit? Or maybe biting the bullet and moving? Chances are you’ve already seen all the highlights—Gamla Stan, Djurgarden, maybe the Ice Bar. Where to delve next, with all that extra time?Here are five highlights for an extended stay in the “Venice of the North”!SkansenAt once a historic open-air museum, a zoo, and a park, Skansen is a must for anyone visiting Stockholm, especially with kids. Established in 1891, the park was first founded as a way to exhibit different ways of life and artifacts around Sweden—and as such it still keeps the odd funicular railway, traditional Sami hut, and a flax mill.You can find everything from glassworks to 16th-century farmhouses to bison and wolverines. They also have a small but detailed terrarium and an enclosed jungle where you can hang out with the lemurs.The best time to travel to Stockholm is in December—when the shopping stalls explode with traditional Swedish handicrafts and gifts.Shopping!Stockholm is a terrific place to catch up on your thrift or designer shopping. You don’t have to wander far anywhere to find a place that stocks brand giants like H&M, Filippa K, Cos.For your vintage or thrift shopping, check out Södermalm specialty shops or weekend flea markets. My favorite is the chain Stadsmission, where you can pick up some stylish jeans, books, metal candlesticks, the list goes on and on.KanelbulleCinnamon and cardamom sweets are a staple in Sweden; it seems they’ve just about taken over every inch of cafes, bakeries, fresh-baked corners of the neighborhood grocery.Succumb to your inner gluten addict and go wild with the kanelbullar (cinnamon rolls), kardemummabullar (cardamom rolls), and vetebröd (braided cardamom bread).Did I mention Swedes are crazy for cardamom?Be sure to munch it down with some morning or afternoon coffee. This is known as fika, the local art of coffee and a roll.Dive into MuseumsStockholm has dozens of engaging museums designed to capture your imagination and curiosity. From the original 17th-century merchant ship at the Vasa Museum to the experimental exhibits at the Modern Museum, there’s something for everyone.Learn all about the Nobel Peace Prize at the Nobel Museum (with daily English guided tours), sing your heart out at the ABBA Museum, or let out your inner child at Junibacken, a magical children’s cultural center.Explore Nature or the ArchipelagoStockholm is one of the most beautiful world capitals I’ve visited. You’re never too far from scenic waterways or picturesque forests. If you have time and the weather’s good, venture out of the city to the many parks, islands, and the archipelago.Stockholm’s ferry system is a remarkable mode of transport that takes you from A to B painlessly and in the blink of an eye. The city’s archipelago, a cluster of 30,000 islands just 20 minutes eastward, is definitely worth a few days’ exploration.Read More: Ten Itinerary Planning Tips for a Trip to EuropeDo you have any tips for visiting Stockholm?

https://theblondeabroad.com/crayfishing-swedish-archipelago/,Crayfishing in the Swedish Archipelago,Sweden,"Sweden is well-known for being surrounding by thousands of small islands (or archipelagoes). These archipelagos begin in the far north in the Swedish Lapland, wrap around the coastline of the deep south and stretch up the west coast.About an hour west of Gothenburg, you’ll reach the gorgeous west coast Swedish archipelago known for fishing villages, beaches and bathing spots. I have been staying on the small island of Lilla Kornö where mostly Swedish families come to spend their summer.One morning, I was invited out for a proper Swedish crayfishing experience. To be honest, I had no idea what I was in store for. Back home, I’d heard the argument over whether they’re called crayfish or crawfish, but I’ve never actually seen or eaten crayfish in Southern California.I have long identified these tasty little crustaceans with cookouts in the South of the US, but didn’t know they could be found in the ocean! In the US, they’re a freshwater creature but, here on the west coast of Sweden, we had to sail out to sea.I was excited for a new foodie experience!We stocked the boat with frozen fish bits (yum!) and set off to harvest our catch-of-the-day from crayfish traps (or pots as they call them) that were resting over 100 feet below the surface.Large orange balloon-type buoys marked the ends of the rope that we would have to pull up to get the pots.Luckily, a motorized contraption did most of the work and, soon enough, we had the first crayfish pot above deck. I could see crabs and crayfish wiggling about inside the pot. The crayfish were tossed into a bucket and the crabs were sent back to sea.After pulling up all the pots, we had 19 of the little cray crays in our bucket!Great success!We re-baited the pots with the frozen fish bits and sent them back to the bottom of the ocean. In a few days, we could return to see if we had caught more.A few things I learned about crayfishing:You don’t want crabs in the pots because they’ll eat the crayfish.Crayfish like to live in the cold, muddy parts of the ocean floor.Crayfish and crabs WILL pinch you. And it hurts. So move fast!You WILL get wet and most likely muddy.[/li_item] I think I got in the way more than I actually helped, but it was fun to see a long-time Swedish tradition. We brought the crayfish back home and went straight to work in the kitchen. Just like with lobster, they’re boiled, but we finished them off in the oven with butter in garlic.Words cannot describe how amazing the kitchen smelled!We paired the meal with fresh vegetables picked straight from the garden and a local, organic wine. The table was lined with a simple tablecloth and decorated with fresh herbs and candlelight.As for the crayfish? They were so fresh you could still taste the salt from the ocean. The buttery texture was similar to lobster and just as delicious.I was in heaven."
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-grona-lund-stockholm/,Visiting Gröna Lund in Stockholm,Sweden,"One of Stockholm’s most popular destinations for both locals and tourists is the amusement park, Gröna Lund. There is fun and food for people of all ages!While exploring the museums and attractions on the island of Djurgården, it’s impossible to miss the towering rides and roller coasters at Gröna Lund. Swings and coasters flip, twirl and light up the waterfront.We spent the evening at the amusement park getting our share of thrills and screams on the spinning Insane roller coaster and the 400 foot high Eclipse swings.I was expecting Gröna Lund to be more of a family destination, but it turns out the park caters to an adult crowd as well. Especially during the summer months.Stop by the beer garden for a cold one and a bite to eat and stay for an evening concert. Over the summer they had concerts nearly every night featuring Swedish artists as well as major acts like Arcade Fire and Flogging Molly.Take a peak inside my day at Gröna Lund!Which ride looks like the most fun to you?"

The busy streets were filled with rich culture, unique architecture and of course, delicious food!Gardens by the Bay was one of the highlights of my trip.Walking through the futuristic forests felt like walking into another planet.

The Supertree Grove is free to walk around in at anytime!The best view of the city is, of course, from above, and I found it at the infinity pool of Marina Bay Sands.The food in Singapore has some of my favorite flavors in the world.

https://theblondeabroad.com/how-to-travel-singapore-on-a-budget/,How to Travel Singapore on a Budget,Singapore,"As a travel destination, Singapore definitely isn’t the easiest on the pockets. Though, you shouldn’t let that keep you from visiting the gorgeous country! Singapore is culturally rich, and you can experience it all on a budget.To stretch your dollar, you’ve just got to plan ahead and know where and how to get the most bang for your buck. Looking for a guide on how to travel around Singapore?Here’s how to travel Singapore on a budget! You’ll want to plan on spending a minimum of $50 to $60 USD per day. This will cover getting around town, eating and staying in inexpensive accommodations.If you want to lay your head somewhere a bit nicer or have some extra cash to spend on bar-hopping, plan for $85 to $100 USD per day.The most expensive things in Singapore are always going to be accommodation and alcohol, so the amount that you want to spend on either will play a major role in calculating your budget. Use Public Transportation in SingaporeThe Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is a modern marvel. It will take you pretty much take you anywhere you wish to go in Singapore. The price of a trip depends on the distance and averages around $4 SGD, which is equivalent to about $3 USD.Buying single tickets for the MRT can add up quickly so getting a Singapore Tourist Pass can save you some serious cash. For unlimited travel, a one-day pass is $10 SGD ($7.50 USD), a two-day pass costs $16 SGD ($12 USD) and a three-day pass goes for $20 SGD ($15 USD).If you’re going to have some non-travel days, check out the EZ-Link card. You can grab one of these reloadable cards at any train station or 7-Eleven.From train stations, an EZ-Link card will set you back $12 SGD ($9 USD), which includes the card and $7 SGD ($5 USD) worth of credit. You Can Drink the Tap WaterThe water is safe to drink in Singapore, so save your cash and some plastic. Instead of buying single-use water bottles, bring a refillable one and carry it with you as you explore.This is my favorite reuseable water bottle for travel!Do Free Things in SingaporeYou could spend days checking out all of the free things to do in Singapore. From exploring the Singapore Botanic Gardens to taking in natural beauty at Sentosa Islands’s beaches, Singapore is filled with complimentary attractions.The Gardens by the Bay were the highlight of my Singapore trip. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest do cost money to get into but the Gardens and Supertree Grove are free to enjoy all day, opening at 5 AM. If you want to explore the upper walkway between the trees, that will set you back $8 SGD ($6 USD) per person.Of course you can wander neighborhoods and popular tourist spots for free. Check out Arab Street, Haji Lane, Joo Chiat and other popular spots!Visiting the East Coast Park and walking along the Changi Point Coastal Walk are other must-see attractions. Afterwards, I recommend learning about Chinese culture at Haw Par Villa and then heading up to The Southern Ridges for a breathtaking view. Budget Accommodations in SingaporeA bed for the night doesn’t always come cheap in Singapore, but there are some good budget options around.Budget Hotels in SingaporeHotel Mono: A little boutique hotel located in the heart of the city, Hotel Mono has ongoing deals running all of the time. They offer single rooms, doubles, and family rooms for up to four people.Hotel Yan: All about the industrial chic aesthetic, Hotel Yan is ideally located next to Little India and offers double rooms for around $120 USD.Hotel Kai: A lovely spot with a dream location, Hotel Kai gives you a personal Wi-Fi device that’ll give you a 24/7 connection all over the country. Single rooms start at $80 USD.Hostels in SingaporeThe Bohemian Chic: This hostel offers stylish social accommodations in the bustling Chinatown in SingaporeThe Pod: It’s all about capsule hotels in Asia, and The Pod is a must-try! Note to the claustrophobic: these actually feel more like bunk beds than other capsules you might have seen online. They offer female, male and mixed dormitories starting at $25 USD.Dream Lodge: Located on the hip Lavender Street, Dream Lodge is right beside three MRT stations, so getting around couldn’t be any easier.Wink Capsule: Another comfy capsule option, the Baroque Wink Capsule property is in buzzing China Town.The Quarters Hostel: Chic and comfortable, The Quarters is a budget traveler’s favorite! Eat at The Hawker StallsThe food in Singapore is deliciously diverse, and you don’t have to spend a fortune to have world-class cuisine. There are food centers and hawker stalls all over the country with Singaporean, Malaysian and Chinese-fusion meals.The Chinatown Food Center is a local icon, and you can fill up on tasty eats here for about $5 SGD ($3.75 USD). I also encourage you to try local specialties like chicken rice, chili crab and Laksa soup (my personal favorite). <Day Trip to Sentosa IslandIf you have the time, head to Sentosa Island as well. While a cable car will set you back $33 SGD ($25 USD) per person, you can just hop on the MRT to Harbourfront Station and walk across to the island.Another budget-travel option is the Sentosa Express, which will take you over for just $4 SGD ($3 USD). "
https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-singapore/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Singapore,Singapore,"As one of Southeast Asia’s most fascinating destinations, Singapore is a diverse island country that has something of interest for every traveler. Whether you have just 24 hours or 3 days in Singapore now is the time to pack your bags and visit this high-tech city.Located off the southern coast of Malaysia, Singapore is a futuristic urban center rich with experiences around every corner. Ready to fall in love with this one-of-a-kind destination?Here are 10 tips for your first trip to Singapore!1. Use Public Transportation or Grab AppSingapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is a traveler’s dream! The country has an impressive public transportation network that will take you anywhere you wish to go.To save cash and time, I’d recommend checking out the Singapore Tourist Pass. It gives you unlimited travel for as long as you wish. A one-day pass is $10 SGD ($7.50 USD), a two-day pass is $16 SGD ($12 USD) or you can get a three-day pass for $20 SGD ($15 USD).While the MRT is great, sometimes it can also be more convenient to just hop in a car. However, taxis are pricey in Singapore, and Uber is no longer a thing.So, download the app, Grab, before you go. It works just like Uber, and it’s a local must-have app!2. Get Travel InsuranceI’ve heard so many horror stories from other travelers that detail the dangers of traveling without insurance! From lost wallets to a major injury, it’s so comforting to know you’re covered in the event anything goes awry when traveling.I have always used World Nomads, and they have saved me some serious cash. From helping with my lost and delayed luggage to covering my damaged camper van in Iceland, I’ve found having the insurance to be totally worth it.Read More: Ten Reasons to Get Travel Insurance for your Next Trip3. Eat Like the LocalsI relished the cuisine in Singapore! You don’t have to go to a Michelin star restaurant here to get a scrumptious meal (although Singapore is home to the cheapest Michelin-starred meal).My top spots are the food centers and hawker stalls around China Town and Marina Bay. Be sure to try Singaporean specialties like Chicken Rice, Chili Crab and Laksa (a spicy noodle soup).Singaporeans are crazy for Prawn Mee, too. Head there for more tasty noodles!Check out this Hawker Center Food Tour + Neighborhood Walk for a more in-depth experience!4. Get to Gardens by the Bay EarlyAs one of the most popular attractions in the city, Gardens by the Bay gets quite busy. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest open up at 9 a.m., so I recommend getting there about 15 minutes early so you’re among the first ones to purchase tickets, which run at $28 SGD (about $21 USD) per person.The Gardens and Supertree Grove are free to enjoy all day, opening at 5 a.m., and you can explore the upper walkway between the trees for $8 SGD ($6 USD) per person.5. Drink the Tap WaterThe water is absolutely safe to drink here. Bring a refillable water bottle, so that you can reduce the amount of plastic you use.This is my favorite reusable water bottle for travel!6. Stick to Happy HourAlcohol is very pricey in Singapore. You’ll find cocktails for $22 SGD ($16.50 USD) at trendy spots downtown and beers in neighborhood bars for as much as $10 SGD ($7.50 USD).Happy hour is a time to look forward to in Singapore. From around 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. in bars across the city, you can find some great deals on drinks of all kinds.If you’re into nightlife, perhaps a Singapore Pub Crawl is right up your alley!7. Stay ConnectedWhile you will find many restaurants and cafés in Singapore with Wi-Fi, the cost (in both time and money) of buying a coffee every time you want to connect adds up quickly.To circumvent this inconvenience, I use the Skyroam Solis when I’m abroad.It lets me connect my phone and laptop (up to five devices) to WiFi all day long with unlimited usage. It can be tricky to get a SIM card in some countries and roaming charges are crazy high. That is where Skyroam comes in. It is such an easy and affordable solution.For a limited time, get an unlimited Skyroam subscription for $99/month!8. Get the Best View in TownI stayed at the iconic Marina Bay Sands and got a chance to take in the view from the infinity pool. The city’s skyline was absolutely gorgeous from up there.To experience the famous pool, you have to be a hotel guest. You can, however, check out the breathtaking view from the Observation Deck on the 57th floor.It’ll set you back $23 SGD ($17 USD), but seeing Singapore from the deck is so worth it!9. You Don’t Always Have to TipTipping isn’t actually a part of Singapore’s culture. The staff doesn’t expect tips, so don’t feel obligated. Though, if you are really happy with the service, tips are most certainly appreciated.10. Pack AccordinglySingapore is hot and humid all-year-round, with temperatures often reaching over 90 degrees (F). Even in the midst of winter, you will rarely see nighttime lows dip below 75 degrees (F).Carry lightweight clothes and be sure to pack a rain jacket. The rain can come down heavily and without warning.While it can actually be refreshing on a hot day, you’ll want to come prepared for the unexpected showers.Recommended Tours in Singapore! "

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-the-ritz-carlton-millenia-singapore/,"Staying at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Singapore,"Is there anything more timelessly chic than The Ritz-Carlton? Synonymous with first-class accommodation, the Ritz is one place that never disappoints. On my recent trip to Singapore, I decided to have a five-star experience and see what it’s all about here. Here is my experience staying at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore!The HotelAccording to Travel & Leisure, this is the best hotel in Singapore. Along with an impressive art collection, impeccable design and a prime location, the 608 guest rooms here have a jaw-dropping view of the famous Singapore skyline over Marina Bay. The RoomsWith rooms ranging from 776 to 2,358 square feet, the rooms at The Ritz-Carlton are among the biggest in Singapore. Rooms like the Premier Suites and Deluxe Suites offer separate bedroom and living room spaces, marvelous marble bathrooms and striking views of the Marina Bay and the city. The Club Premier rooms are equally nice options that will also give you Club Level access — which I HIGHLY recommend. If you want more room to spread out, the Millenia Suite offers one and two-bedroom options, which begin at 1,098 square feet. The suites also offer iconic views of Marina Bay.Finally, if you are ready for the ultimate VIP treatment for up to six people, there is the Ritz Suite with 24-hour personalized butler service, a high tech entertainment room and an oversized jacuzzi tub in the master bathroom. With all the hype, the rooms at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore did not disappoint. We stayed in the Club Deluxe Marina room, and it was flawless. The view was truly stunning and the fabulous marble bathroom was basically a private spa. The Club Level AccessThe Club Premier Suite, Club Deluxe Suite and Millenia Suites offer access to The Ritz-Carlton Club Lounge. Located on the top floor, this is a place to chill, work and be pampered. With a buffet of tasty options available for breakfast, mid-day snacks, afternoon tea, hors-d’oeuvres and cocktails, there are delicious treats served up here from morning until night. I’d highly recommend adding club-level access to your room or booking a club room so that you can enjoy the club-level benefits during your stay. On top of having wonderful food, wine tastings and handcrafted cocktails, it offers what is easily one of the best views in Singapore. There’s even a cool space with easels and drawing materials where you can try your hand at drawing the skyline. If you’re there on business, there’s also a boardroom available. Last but not least, guests with club access can be driven around in the complimentary club town car. Available on a first-come, first-serve basis, you can get a ride anywhere within the Marina Bay area!Food + DrinkOne of the best things about Singapore is the food, and the food at The Ritz-Carlton has it all. With vibrant and multi-ethnic menus at their on-property restaurants, you can have a taste of anything. For fine dining, the Michelin-star rated Summer Pavilion has some of the tastiest authentic Cantonese you will ever try.For afternoon tea, a quick bite or cocktails, the Chihuly Lounge is the place to be. But in my opinion, The Colony at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore‘s dining experience is an absolute must!The Colony serves every meal of the day, including afternoon tea from Monday to Saturday and a Champagne brunch on Sundays. It is a luxury buffet at a reasonable price, with a smart-casual dress code.They have seven stations including an ice bar with salads, cold cuts, and cheese; a grill and rotisserie with a range of Western and Asian grilled meats and a steam basket with Asian noodles, soups and steamed dishes. They also have a wok with local specialities; a tandoor with Indian meats, seafood and bread; a fruit stall with fresh juices and fruits and a patisserie with desserts of all kind.It was truly the most amazing buffet I’ve ever eaten at.The SpaThe Ritz-Carlton Spa offers a full menu of massages, facials and other spa favorites like full nail and salon services. I didn’t get a chance to check it out, but they’ve got ten treatment rooms to treat yourself, plus romantic packages for couples. In My OpinionThe Ritz is consistently impressive and this one was no exception. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special and take care of anything we needed. I can’t recommend the Club Level experience enough; it was luxury taken to the next level.The location of the hotel was great and the access to the town car was very convenient. Plus, The Colony buffet was by far the BIGGEST and BEST buffet I have ever been to in the world! Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Singapore!More InformationHotel: The Ritz-Carlton Millenia SingaporeLocation: SingaporeAccommodation: LuxuryPrice Range: $$$-$$$$Thanks to The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-marina-bay-sands-in-singapore/,Staying at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore,Singapore,"Welcome to a stunning architectural icon. If you have ever seen pictures of Singapore, you have likely seen shots of the Marina Bay Sands hotel in the city’s scape. This place is easily one of the most famous hotels in Asia, if not the world. An architectural wonder in the heart of Singapore, this is one place that will definitely captivate you as you begin exploring the city. Wonder what it’s like inside? Here’s my experience staying at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.The HotelThis place is practically a city in and of itself. Home to the world’s largest rooftop infinity pool, the Marina Bay Sands offers 2,561 hotel rooms, a 1,300,000 square-foot convention center, shops, a museum, two theaters, the world’s largest atrium casino and a range of other exhibits. At the top of the three 55-floor towers of this 5-star hotel is the world famous SkyPark, which has an infinity swimming pool. With 360-degree views of Singapore, you can’t stay the Marina Bay Sands without bringing your camera up here. The RoomsThe Marina Bay Sands in Singapore offers a range of room options with views of the skyline, gardens or the harbor. The Deluxe Room or Premier Room are good choices for couples looking for a cozy space for the night. If you are traveling with family or a group, the Family Room offers ample space to spread out. The hotel offers Club Rooms and different suites that are located on the high floors of the building an enticing array of VIP upgrades. Upgraded room and suite guests receive complimentary afternoon tea as well as cocktails and canapés at Club55, plus free breakfast at one of the on-site celebrity chef restaurants. SkyParkThe infinity pool is really the crown jewel of the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. Located 57 levels above the city, the Sands SkyPark offers breathtaking views of Singapore in every direction. From the top of the world, you can swim to the edge of the pool or lounge in a jacuzzi. Once you are ready to take a step back from the edge, there are lounge chairs under shady palm trees that are perfect for relaxing and sipping some cocktails. They also offer poolside drinks and light snacks all day long. The rooftop experience is available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., so I would highly recommend getting up there for either sunrise or sunset to behold central Singapore at a golden hour.It is worth noting that access to the Marina Bay Sands Infinity Pool is exclusively for registered hotel guests, so if you want to experience this icon for yourself, you’ve got to reserve a room here. Food + DrinkThe Marina Bay Sands in Singapore has a whopping 80+ restaurants! It’s impossible to get into all of the details here, but I do know that there is something for everyone among the vast culinary lineup. I actually didn’t get the chance to eat at Marina Bay Sands, so I couldn’t personally recommend any picks. However, there are a lot of well-reviewed options here. They have everything from the DC Comics Super Heroes Café to a romantic rooftop Italian restaurant. All of the eateries feature plates from top celebrity chefs and fusion options borrowing flavors from distinct cultures around the world.ActivitiesThe Marina Bay Sands in Singapore is part shopping mall, part casino, part convention center, and part hotel. You will definitely not run out of things to do while staying here.Shop ’till you drop through a mix of international, luxury and new concept stores. Check out the line up of concerts and shows that play all throughout the year.The hotel is also located right next to Gardens by the Bay, so you can walk over to the Supertree Groves and Cloud Forest easily!Visit the Digital Light Canvas for a unique artistic experience and don’t miss the Spectra Light & Water Show that plays every night!<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span> In My OpinionI felt Marina Bay Sands was an immense hotel, reminiscent of something I’d find on the Las Vegas Strip. I stayed in the basic Deluxe Room and was only really there for a few hours. With that said, I wasn’t able to experience restaurants, shops or amenities. The view from the pool was definitely the most noteworthy part of my stay. More InformationHotel: Marina Bay SandsLocation: SingaporeAccommodation: UpscalePrice Range: $$$Thanks to Marina Bay Sands for hosting me during my stay.

Throughout Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, and beyond, you will find the greatest Christmas markets in the world.Filled with twinkling lights and the heady aroma of holiday spices, these places are truly magical. And there’s no better way to experience the holiday season than on a river cruise.When I found out that Crystal Cruises does a Danube Christmas Markets cruise, I started packing. I have traveled through the Seychelles Islands as well as taken a Brazilian Holiday cruise (my first ever cruise) with Crystal Cruises and have been in love with cruises ever since.Cruising from Vienna, Austria, into Passau, Germany; Krems, Austria; and Bratislava, Slovakia, I saw some of the most breathtaking architecture I’ve ever seen in my life. And the markets! If you like to shop until you drop and explore foodie wonderlands, welcome to heaven.I fell head over heels in love with Austria on my European Christmas market tour. We started off at the Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Market, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Vienna.With baroque architecture, this lavish former imperial residence would take your breath away at any time of year, and it is in its prime at Christmas.Next up, with chestnuts literally roasting on an open fire, Vienna’s most popular Christmas market, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz, delivers serious classic yuletide cheer at its 150+ stalls.In Austria, we also took a tour of the Salzburg Christmas Markets and the traditional markets of the Austrian Lake District. It was love at first sight with the little village of St. Gilgen. It was straight out of a storybook. With snow-capped mountains and icy lakes, the entire region is picture-perfect.Tagged the “most romantic market” in the region, the Christmas market in Passau, Germany, was my favorite. With its own unique flair, this place was everything I expected of a Christmas market and more.Of course, you can’t talk about Christmas without mentioning the food. So, for you foodies out there, head to the Bratislava Christmas Market. This Slovakia market delivers yummy dishes on an unprecedented scale.Ready to get in the holiday spirit? It’s time to start planning your own trip to visit the Christmas Markets in Europe."

Exploring the Christmas markets of Austria, Germany and Slovakia has always been a dream of mine, and it makes for an idyllic destination to enjoy a white Christmas.Ready to have your breath taken away by the snow-capped mountains and quaint destinations dotting the Danube River? Crystal River Cruises will get you there.My boyfriend, Meyer, and I spent ten days on the stunning Crystal Mozart and were blown away by the world-class hospitality and service. PLUS, cruising through the European Christmas Markets was a bucket list experience in itself.Here’s what to expect from the Danube Christmas Market River Cruise with Crystal Cruises.Day One: Vienna, AustriaWe were able to board the Crystal Mozart around noon on day one! Upon arrival, we got settled onto the ship, explored a bit, and then jumped on the complimentary shuttle into town to explore Vienna.We opted for an early night so we could get ready for our upcoming whirlwind adventure!Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Two: Vienna, AustriaWe spent the first morning out exploring the city. The Imperial Schönbrunn Palace and Christmas Market were the highlights of the day.The market outside the palace was one of my favorites! It was a picture-perfect introduction to Christmas markets and ended up being one of my favorite spots that we visited during the entire journey.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Three: Melk, AustriaOur morning started on a cruise through the Wachau Valley and we arrived late morning in Melk. This was such a charming region. As we went through the valley, I tuned my listening device in, provided by the cruise, to hear about all of the sights we were passing by.This region is famous for its Baroque architecture. We explored the Melk Abbey, and it was truly remarkable. The library was incredible, though, sadly, there was a strict “no photos” policy, but we did get some great shots from outside.Be sure to keep your eyes peeled for the Schönbühel Castle!Day Four: Salzburg, AustriaOur scheduled itinerary in Linz offered a full-day trip to Salzburg. We took the full-day trip around Salzburg’s Christmas Markets.We opted out of the tour of Hellbrunn Palace, but we heard it was beautiful and I would recommend checking it out. After returning to the ship, you’ll be docked within walking distance to the Linz Christmas Market.It’s right on the river, so it’s easy to get to and in its prime in the evening.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in SalzburgDay Five: Austria’s Lake DistrictThe next morning we took another full-day trip to explore the “traditional Christmas” scene of St. Gilgen and St. Wolfgang in Austria’s Lake District. This was one of my favorite adventures on the cruise.St. Gilgen is straight out of a storybook, and you get lots of time to explore the lovely St. Wolfgang. Both towns have incredible markets and great photo ops on the lake with views of snow-capped mountains in the background.Day Six: Passau, GermanyWe had such a hard time deciding what to do on this day! Our excursion options for this day were a Munich full-day tour, a Passau walking tour, a snow show hike, or both of the latter two. We decided not to do Munich — everyone said it was awesome, but it was a four-hour drive back from Munich to the ship.Ultimately, my boyfriend did the Passau Walking Tour & Christmas Market, while I stayed behind on the ship. It ended up pouring the entire day, and it made for a challenging day to be out and about.We had planned to do the Bavarian Snowshoe Hike when he got back, but assumed that we didn’t have enough warm clothes, so we ended up skipping it.This was yet another regret! We heard from other guests that it was absolutely fabulous.If you decide to skip Munich and do the snowshoeing, know that the company provides boots that go over your shoes, though packing snow boots are a great idea if you can squeeze them into your bag.Day Seven: Regensburg, GermanyThe day trip to Regensburg was definitely my favorite day. It is such a stunning town, and we got the whole day to explore on our own. We saw the main old town, then met back up with a guide to visit the “most romantic Christmas market”.Located at the doorstep of a German princess’s house, this market completely exceeded my expectations. We enjoyed lots of roasted chestnuts, gingerbread and mulled wine (famously known as glühwein in Germany).Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in Regensburg, GermanyDay Eight: Krems, AustriaKrem is known as the pearl of Wachau Valley and rightfully so. It’s rich in history and beautiful sights.We arrived on a Sunday, which means that pretty much everything in Central Europe is closed. Krems is a really sleepy town, and I’d suggest a solo tour rather than going for the Krems Highlights & Christmas Market excursion.Day Nine: Bratislava, SlovakiaAfter so many walking tours, it was nice to have a morning on board to just chill and soak in the five-star experience. We arrived to Bratislava at noon.We took the Panoramic Bratislava & Christmas Market tour and really loved the old town of Bratislava. It’s home to remarkable architecture.Not to mention, the Christmas market had TONS of food — much more than other markets we’d seen in Austria and Germany.Day Ten: Vienna, AustriaWe returned to Vienna and spent the whole day on our own walking to iconic spots like the Cafe Central and the most popular Christmas Market in Vienna, Christkindlmarkt Rathausplatz.Our cruise ended with a special Michelin dinner which was included in all 2017 bookings (double check your 2018 bookings to confirm yours)!Honestly, we already felt like we had been digging into Michelin quality meals the entire time, but it was a great experience to gather all the other guests together at one massive table to chat and share travel stories.Read More: Visiting the Christmas Markets in ViennaDay Eleven: DepartureWe packed up all of our Christmas gifts and market souvenirs, and disembarked the Crystal Mozart late morning.Crystal River Cruises had another complimentary shuttle back to the airport, so we could haul our souvenirs without any hassle. An absolute life-saver when traveling!Instead of heading straight home, we decided to extend our trip and head over to explore the city of Budapest! Staying at the incredible The Ritz-Carlton, Budapest, this city quickly became one of my all-time favorite European destinations.All photos edited with TBA Presets!Thanks to Crystal Cruises for hosting me during my stay. As always, thoughts and opinions expressed here are entirely my own."
https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-thailand/,10 Local Foods to Try in Thailand,Thailand,"I’ll admit that while I was trekking around Thailand, I was a bit intimated by all the different foods — specifically, Thai street food. Yet I was intrigued—so intrigued! I just didn’t know where to start…Most people are familiar with Pad Thai or the many curries, but when you dive deeper into Thai culture and cuisine, you’ll find there are so many incredible dishes just bursting with flavor. Thai food is complex; it’s known to be sweet, sour, and spicy—all at the same time.Curious about what the essential flavors are? You’ll often find ginger, turmeric, basil, garlic, a sprinkling of peanuts, and even coconut!Oftentimes the best way to get a taste for culture is by sampling the local cuisine, but sometimes you aren’t sure what meals are must-haves.To cut out the confusion, I’m dishing up this guide to 10 local foods you need to try in Thailand! Pad ThaiPad Thai or Phad Thai is a stir-fried noodle dish commonly served as street food and at most restaurants in Thailand. The typical ingredients you’ll find? Rice noodles, eggs, tofu, fish sauce, shrimp, garlic, red chili pepper, and peanuts! This meal was actually listed at number five on the “World’s 50 Most Delicious Foods” readers’ poll done by CNN.Quite honestly, I’m not surprised! Pad Thai is a staple and if you’re just getting introduced to Thai cuisine, it’s a great place to start!Gaeng Keow Wan KaiDon't fret: the long name means green chicken curryThe “green” part of the name comes from the color of the green chilies. As you might have guessed, there are other colorful curries! Some popular ones include red and yellow—each with their own unique flavor and spice level. We’ll get to that next! Green curry is typically served with a heaping portion of rice (to soak up the soup-like quality).Gaeng DaengAlso known as red curry, this is MUCH spicier than its green sibling!This dish has soooo many different variations, so even if you’ve sampled red curry, you might find a completely different version elsewhere.Yam NuaYam Nua is a spicy beef salad. Yam literally means “mix,” which is fitting for this mixed salad. Using skirt steak, onion, coriander, spearmint, lime, and dried chili, it perfectly embodies the invigorating flavors of Thai salads.Khao PadAlso known as Thai fried riceIt differs from Chinese fried rice in that it uses Thai jasmine rice rather than regular long-grain rice. Typically a meat like chicken, pork, shrimp, or crab is added for a protein element. Some places like to put their own spin on it by experimenting with pineapple, basil, or even coconut.Mango Sticky RiceHow I love the sweetness of this dish!Mango sticky rice is a traditional Thai dessert made up of sticky rice, fresh mango, and coconut milk. It’s just as delicious as it sounds.April through June is the peak time for mangos in Thailand, which also means peak mango sticky rice season (that’s a thing, right?). Rice and mango might sound like a silly combination, but trust me when I say it’s a real TREAT. Laap/LarbLaap or Larb is a savory meat salad—don’t let the name scare you away. It might be a bit messy, but that’s part of the fun. It’s a zesty combination of lime juice, chili flakes, fish sauce, minced pork and a bunch of herbs, which give it a truly refreshing flavor. Oh, and it just so happens to be known as the “unofficial” dish of Laos. The minced meat is typically eaten with sticky rice, though depending on the region you visit, it’s prepared in a few different ways. There are cooked and raw versions…but for the sake of your stomach, I highly recommend just trying the cooked version!Best way to eat it? With your hands!Grab sticky rice in your palm with a bit of Laap and firmly shape it before washing it down with a cold beer. You’ll be feeling like a local in no time. 😉Spring RollsSpring rolls are a typical Thai appetizerThey’re pretty darn easy to snack on…dangerously so! They pair perfectly with sweet chili dipping sauce.Tom Yum GoongTom Yum is probably the most famous of the Thai soups!This dish is super popular not only in Thailand but in Thai restaurants all around the world. Tom Yum Goong is the most well-known variety of Tom Yum and is made with shrimp. It’s characterized by its distinct hot and sour flavors, with fragrant spices and herbs. Tom Kha GaiNot to be confused with Tom Yum Goong! I actually prefer Tom Kha Gai (it’s very possibly my favorite Thai dish!). Sometimes this is seen spelled as Tom Kha Kai.You might think that something made with coconut milk would be sweet, but this Thai coconut soup is the complete opposite: it’s savory! Most recipes typically include coconut milk, chicken, galangal (aka Thai ginger, but with a distinctly different flavor than the ginger you’re probably familiar with), lime, lemongrass, chili peppers, mushrooms, and fish sauce. Fun Fact: In the late 19th-century, the dish was actually not a soup. It was a dish made of chicken or duck simmered in coconut broth. However, the broth was too good to resist and it evolved into the savory soup I now know and LOVE!Quick Guide to Thai Food for VegetariansIf you’re a vegetarian, look out for “mang sa wirat.”That phrase loosely translates to no noticeable pieces of meat or seafood. However, chefs may still use chicken broth or eggs in the dish.If you’re a vegan, look out for the word “jay.” If you aren’t vegetarian and you’re looking for a chicken dish, keep an eye out for “gai.” If you want shrimp, it’ll say “gung.” Beginner's Guide to Thai Street FoodWhy is that rice purple? What’s inside that banana leaf? How do I eat a whole fish on a stick? Read MoreBonus: Thai SweetsThai sweets are NOT something you want to miss out on. While I did include the mango sticky rice above, Thai desserts seriously deserve their own category.Thai Iced TeaThai Iced Tea is the nectar of the gods. It’s a sweet tea made up of condensed milk, tea, and sugar. If you haven’t had it before, the first sip might send you into a shock of sweetness. That said, it’s super refreshing on a hot day or as a way to finish up a meal! Any Marzipan DelightsThai marzipan is made from mung beans and is sculpted and painted to look like little glossy fruits and vegetables.A treat for both the mouth and the eyes!Helpful Tip:Because so many of these dish names are loosely translated from Thai, you’ll often find variations on the name and spelling in Thai restaurants—don’t let that deter you from trying them!If you’re visiting Thailand soon, I highly encourage you to try one of these local dishes…or you know, all of them! Can’t make it to Thailand? Why not switch up your order at your local Thai restaurant and sample something different. You might just LOVE what you find! So, which Thai dishes would you try? Let me know if you’ve had any of these or if there’s a dish you absolutely recommend in the comments below!"

The main ferry companies that service the route to Koh Samui are SeaTran Ferries, Lomprayah Ferries, and Raja Ferries.Plane: If you’re short on time, the most convenient and fastest way to get to the island is to fly. There are daily flights from Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Krabi, and Pattaya as well as from neighboring countries like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur.

Chaweng Beach is where you’ll find the island’s party scene as well a beautiful (but busy) beach and lots of restaurants.If you’re looking for something more laid back, stay in Choeng Mon. There aren’t any parties here and fewer people on the beach.Maenam Beach is home to some of the best luxury resorts on the island. It’s also far away from the popular tourist spots and the perfect option for travelers searching for privacy, tranquility and five-star service.Here are a few of my favorite accommodation options in Koh Samui for all budgets:Moonstone Villa: If you’re traveling to Koh Samui with a large group of friends, splurge on a stay at Moonstone Villa. It’s a beautiful luxury villa and comes with a team of full-time staff to make sure your stay is perfect. The property also comes with free kayaks for guests and boasts some of the best views of the island.Deva Beach Resort & Spa: Deva Beach Resort is a great mid-range option in Koh Samui. Located in Choeng Mon, you’re only a short distance away from Chaweng if you want to experience the island’s nightlife. Otherwise, you can spend your days relaxing at the on-site spa or catching a tan on the beach.UBOX Hostel: Ubox Hostel is in the heart of Chaweng’s party scene. A shared dorm room will cost you as little as $9 a night, and you’ll be within walking distance of the beach.  Big BuddahDay OneGo Temple HoppingAfter grabbing breakfast at your hotel or one of the local restaurants, start your first day in Koh Samui with a temple hopping adventure. You don’t need to sign up for a formal tour, but you’ll need to rent a scooter to get around or use taxis.The Big Buddha is the most famous temple on Koh Samui. Wat Phra Yai is a close second, and both temples are near Bophut.Next, visit Wat Plai Laem. It’s a huge complex of temples and its where you can see a sculpture of a Guanyin (the Buddhist bodhisattva associated with compassion).End of your temple tour with a visit to visit Mae Nam Village for lunch.Visit Na Muang WaterfallNa Muang Waterfall is an hour away from the Big Buddha temple. There isn’t any public transportation to the falls, so you’ll need a scooter or to arrange with a taxi to drop you off and fetch you later.The best times to visit the falls is during the rainy season (September to November).The first waterfall is Na Muang 1 and has a beautiful natural pool that you can swim in. If you want to escape the crowds, you can walk a further 30 minutes uphill to the smaller Na Muang 2 waterfall.There is no entrance for the falls, but some locals will try to ask you for money or tell you that you need a guide to find the waterfalls. Go on a Street Food TourInstead of heading to a restaurant for dinner, sign up for a guided street food walking tour in Koh Samui. It will give you a chance to try some of the best Thai dishes on the island.If you’re traveling to Koh Samui on a budget and don’t want to spend extra money on an organized tour, you can take yourself on a self-guided foodie adventure.

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-tips-for-your-first-trip-to-thailand/,10 Tips for Your First Trip to Thailand,Thailand,"After quitting my job and deciding to travel around the world for three months, I flew halfway around the world and started a backpacking adventure in Southeast Asia. One of my first stops in the region was Thailand where I had a budget of only $20 per day!While Thailand’s beautiful islands, full moon parties, and delicious street food made it an unforgettable trip, there are a few things that I wish I had known beforehand.Here are my 10 tips for your first trip to Thailand!You Don’t Need a VisaIf you’re a US citizen traveling to Thailand, you don’t need to apply for a visa. You’ll get one on arrival as long as your passport is valid for at least six months and has two blank pages.You’ll get a free 30-day visa at the airport or from one of the overland borders. If that’s not long enough for you, it’s possible to apply for a 60-day visa at any Thai embassy before you enter the country.Read More: How to Expedite Your U.S. Passport Renewal Check The WeatherThailand has two distinct seasons that will greatly impact the cost of your trip and what you want to do. If you’re traveling to Thailand on a shoestring and you want to spend as little as possible, plan your trip between May and October.It’s the country’s monsoon season and when it receives most of its yearly rainfall. The less than perfect weather means you’ll easily pick up excellent deals on flights, accommodation, and activities.Plus, the rainfall only lasts for a few hours, so your entire day isn’t ruined!If you want picture perfect weather for island hopping adventures and excellent scuba diving conditions, book your vacation to Thailand during the dry season. From November to April, you can expect high visibility at dive sites, warm temperatures with lower humidity and Thailand’s massive water fight festival, Songkran.The only downside is that its high season. Airlines increase their prices for flights, hotels, hostels can book out, and there will be large crowds at the top attractions.Read More: The Ultimate Thailand Travel Guide Don’t Drink the Tap WaterThailand’s tap water is not safe to drink – unless you want Delhi belly. Instead, pack a reusable water bottle and fill up at your hotel or the water dispensers in the street.The dispensers only cost a couple of Baht, and you can fill up one liter at a time!It’s also a good idea to avoid eating fruits and vegetables that have been washed with tap water. It’s how a lot of people get sick during their trip. Don’t Ride The ElephantsA few years ago, riding an elephant was on almost every person’s bucket list for Thailand. However, since multiple reports have come out on how cruelly these animals are treated, it’s an activity that must be avoided at all costs.Luckily, there are elephant sanctuaries in the north of Thailand that are rescuing these animals from the tourist camps and giving them a chance to lead a natural life. Do your research and visit a reputable sanctuary instead.You can go home knowing that your money has contributed to the conservation and well-being of these creatures and not towards an industry that physically and mentally torments them. Go Island HoppingSome of Thailand’s best destinations are the country’s islands in the south. Phuket, Koh Phi Phi, and Koh Pha Ngan are some of the most famous places to visit, but there are plenty of lesser-known gems to discover in between.However, you’ll want to be strategic about your island hopping itinerary (especially if you’re on limited time) and wrap your head around the ferry system.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Island Hopping in Thailand Buy a Sim CardWhile it’s easy to find Wi-Fi at most bars, restaurants, shops, and hotels in Thailand, it’s still a good idea to buy a local sim card once you arrive. You can get a tourist package for 40 days that comes with 3 or 6 GB for between $15 – $25!It’s a small price to pay to make sure that you’re always connected. Try the Street FoodThailand boasts some of the best street food in the world! It only costs a couple of dollars to fill your plate up with massive portions of Phad Thai, sticky rice and mango and Tom Yum Goong!Paying between $1-3 for a meal is what helped me stick to my $20 backpacking budget. But be warned – Thai food is a different level of spicy! Play it safe and order your dishes mild.Read More: The Beginner’s Guide to Thai Street Food Pack Mosquito SprayMosquitoes are everywhere in Thailand, especially during the wet season. Before you hop onto your flight, be sure to pack a repellent that is at least 50% deet.Once you’ve arrived, you can lessen your chances of being bitten by covering up between dusk and dawn. Pack a long-sleeved shirt and a pair of long pants that you can wear during the night. Respect Thai CultureIn Thailand, the head is considered the most important part of the body. Don’t touch a Thai person on the head; it’s considered very rude and offensive.Another thing to avoid is pointing with your feet towards a person or an image of Buddha or the King.Keeping face is also an important part of Thai culture. Raising your voice and getting angry with the locals will get you nowhere.It’s also against the law to speak negatively about the royal family. If you’re caught criticizing the monarchy, you can face serious jail time. Pack Clothes for Temple VisitsIf you’re planning on visiting any of Thailand’s beautiful temples, you’ll need to have the correct attire. It’s considered disrespectful to show up in clothes that show a lot of skin, and you won’t be allowed to enter.When packing for your trip, be sure to pack an outfit that will cover your shoulders and knees for temple visits. I’d also recommend bringing along a scarf or a shawl that you can keep in your bag in case you stumble across a temple that you really want to explore!Read More: The Ultimate Bangkok Travel Guide Do you have tips for visiting Thailand?

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-romantic-things-for-couples-to-do-in-thailand/,10 Romantic Things for Couples to Do in Thailand,Thailand,"Hey guys! It’s Michael and Alexandra from Couple’s Coordinates, and we are excited to be contributing to TBA again.Since we last wrote for TBA, we have visited 15 new countries and have had some pretty romantic experiences. Last year we even got married in Bora Bora! For our first blog back with the team at TBA, we wanted to share some of our favorite romantic things for couples to do in Thailand. We recently spent 2 weeks in Thailand and had the opportunity to island hop and see the gorgeous mainland of Thailand from the city streets of Bangkok to the countryside of Chiang Mai.Hike to the Koh Phi Phi ViewpointKoh Phi Phi is one of the most beautiful islands in Thailand and is world famous for a couple of reasons: The Leonardo DiCaprio movie The beach and the 2004 tsunami that struck the island.Since 2004 a lot has changed; volunteers and aid workers helped bring the island back to life and then investment fueled the development of the island. It has, admittedly, become a bit touristy, but there are still loads of places on the island where you’ll feel completely alone with your significant other and the locals.Couple the heat and humidity with a ton of stairs and you’re sure to be a bit sweaty when you reach the top. Don’t worry though; the view will completely overshadow your partner being a bit smelly.Bathe Elephants in Chiang MaiWe have traveled to over 30 countries together as a couple and have had the opportunity to engage in some pretty incredible activities that have been romantic, exhilarating, and just plain fun. Of all of these activities, bathing elephants at a sanctuary in Chiang Mai might top the list.We spent the day hiking around the Elephant Nature Park feeding and bathing elephants. We had the opportunity to learn about the damage humans do to elephants and educate ourselves on these incredible creatures. Elephants are just HUGE puppies.They are smart, loyal, and love playing.Take note of places in Thailand (as well as India, Africa, etc.) which allow you to ride elephants. These places invariably harm the elephants to train them to give rides to tourists. Elephant Nature Reserve and other similar parks are sanctuaries that rescue elephants.Treat Yourselves to a Fancy and Romantic, Yet Cheap, DinnerFor those of us in the “Western” world, Thailand is an incredibly affordable destination to visit. You’ll love being able to have romantic and “fancy” dinners with your partner on the cheap.Sure, meals can reach $100 or more at nice resorts, but you’ll find loads of incredible restaurants where you and your partner can dine in style for $20-30. Heck, we can’t even go to Chipotle for $20 here in the States.Skinny Dip at Your VillaWhen you have a private pool at your villa, there is absolutely no reason to wear a bathing suit. We enjoyed a villa with a private pool and sunbathing deck while we were staying on Koh Samui.The island, itself, is gorgeous and romantic, but spending the afternoon swimming and lounging nude with your significant other can really elevate the romance.Or come inside and take a nice bubble bath when it starts pouring rain outside!Hire a BoatSpeaking of that incredible exchange rate….you can hire a private long-tail boat and explore the coastline as well as other islands for about $50 USD a day. Some of our favorite days in Thailand were spent on a boat exploring the Phi Phi Islands or the coastline of Krabi.The boats are super cute and provide you the opportunity to reach remote areas of islands and secluded beaches that you might otherwise not be able to reach by foot.You don’t need a yacht or a fancy boat to have an incredible time with your partner on the sea. These long-tail boats are quite romantic and charming in their own right.The men who sail them happen to have a lifetime of experience and a wealth of knowledge of the area. They can be your personal tour guide for the day!Snorkel Maya BeachMaya Beach is the famous beach on Phi Phi Lee where Leo shot the movie The Beach, but the best parts of the island are actually on the back side of the island. Maya Beach has been closed to tourism over the last year or so because of litter and damage to the surrounding reefs.Unfortunately, many tourists treat this gorgeous oasis as a garbage can. Head around the back of the island on a boat and snorkel with the locals (the many species of fish) and the gorgeous coral reef.The water is warm, clear, and absolutely beautifully blue.To explore all that Phi Phi Lee and Maya Beach have to offer, wake up early, hire a long-tail boat, and explore for the day. The crowds don’t usually show up until after 09:00, so if you’re an early riser like we are, you can have the beach to yourself.There’s a reason so many of our photos have no humans in the background…we don’t edit them out…we explore before they’re awake.Explore Railay BeachRailay Beach is one of the most famous coves and stretches of beach in Krabi. To reach the beach, you’ll need to hire a long-tail boat and sail over.Once here you can explore the surrounding area, rock climb, or swim in the gorgeous water and lay on the beach and relax with a good book as we did!The cliffs that encompass Railay Beach are the steep, ubiquitous, cliffs seen throughout the Krabi province. They’re lush and green while simultaneously steep and rocky. The scenery at Railay is absolutely breathtaking, and you can reach this beach quite easily from the nearby town of Ao Nang.Couples MassageThe Thai are fantastic masseuses. One of the best benefits of traveling in Asia – especially Thailand and Bali – is the prevalence of massage parlors and the incredibly affordable prices of massages. While in Thailand we got a couples massage almost daily because they are often as cheap as $5/person.When we “splurged,” our massages were about $20-30/person.Too bad even mediocre massages in the US are usually $100! When we lived in Bali, we got massages on a regular basis, and we would absolutely do the same if we lived in Thailand. So take advantage of the affordable therapy and pamper yourselves.Take a Muay Thai ClassWe trained with a professional Muay Thai fighter and got our asses kicked! The workout was strenuous, but the experience was awesome. Neither of us had ever practiced Muay Thai before our trip to Thailand, but we had an absolute blast. We even wore the traditional Muay Thai boxing shorts for fun.Many resorts offer Muay Thai classes as an added amenity, and there is a myriad of Muay Thai gyms around Thailand that would be happy to welcome you as a guest and provide an introductory training.If you’re looking for an affordable and extremely romantic destination, Thailand would be a great place for you and your partner to visit in 2018. As we approach the fall, flights will inevitably get cheaper as well.You should be able to fly round-trip from the west coast of the United States for around $700. If you have any specific questions, please feel free to ask us in the comments below. We will get to as many of you as possible!Go White Water RaftingWe had the chance to go white water rafting on a river near Chiang Mai. Just as we were about to get into the boat, the heavens opened up, and we had a massive, torrential, downpour of rain. Subsequently, we were soaking wet before we even got in the boat.The rafting experience was an excellent way to see some more remote areas of Chiang Mai, get a good workout, and enjoy an adrenaline rush.For detailed travel tips on Thailand, check out our Thailand travel guide."
https://theblondeabroad.com/getting-scuba-certified-in-koh-tao-with-roctopus-dive/,Getting Scuba Certified in Koh Tao with Roctopus Dive,Thailand,"This post was written by Lauren, one of our Expert Travel Contributors!**As a note, The Blonde Abroad always recommends looking for a certified PADI Dive Shop along your travels, and especially when getting scuba certified. For more information on locating PADI Dive Shops around the world, click here.** There’s so much to see just beneath the surface! I’ve always loved the beach but never realized quite how stunning the ocean is until I learned how to dive.Getting PADI Open Water certified was something I’d always wanted to do, but I could never decide where to go for it. While planning a trip to Koh Tao in Thailand, I discovered that this is one of the most beautiful diving locales in the worlds- and I knew it was the perfect timing! I decided to reach out to Roctopus Dive.Here’s my experience getting scuba certified in Koh Tao with Roctopus Dive! Diving in Koh TaoLocated in the heart of the Gulf of Thailand, Koh Tao is everything you’d expect from a tropical paradise. With the exception of a few rainy weeks in October and November, the weather is flawless with the average day ranging from the mid-70s to the high 80s year-round.Koh Tao has earned a reputation for being one of the greatest diving spots on the planet, and it’s easy to see why. With good visibility, calm seas, and warm waters, this place has it all. On top of being great for beginners like yours truly, there are dive sites for every level with an amazing variety of marine life.  Roctopus Dive on Koh TaoDive companies vary so much in Thailand and I’d highly recommend doing your research and checking out reviews before you book anywhere. I went with Roctopus Dive and had an incredible experience. They often customized services and have a fun, highly educated staff.Given that they mostly do SSI and RAID certifications, Roctopus is not a PADI Dive Shop so they set me up with a private instructor, Desa, to go through the PADI Open Water Diver course at my request. She walked me through the entire certification process from the beginning to end. I really can’t imagine a better teacher. In her many years of experience, she has instructed and dived all around the world.She has so much knowledge to share and she really has a knack for teaching.Roctopus Dive also has great facilities. They have their own offices with classrooms and a private pool, as well as high-quality equipment and an all-around friendly staff.Just as importantly, these guys have marine awareness. There are way too many companies aimed at tourists that are destroying the local environment, so it’s good to see a company that really takes environmental and marine life protection seriously.  PADI Open Water Diver CourseHaving spent most of my life in and around the ocean, I’m a decent swimmer but I had zero scuba experience prior to walking in the door of Roctopus. Fortunately, all you need to get started is basic swimming skills. Here’s how it works.The PADI Open Water Diver course consists of three main phases:Knowledge development to understand basic principles of scuba diving (this can be online or classroom-based classes, or through independent study).Confined Water Dives to learn basic scuba skills.Open Water Dives to use your skills and explore.The first day, I spent the morning studying then hit the dive shop’s private pool to learn all basic skills. My instructor, Desa, walked me through everything. She taught me how to use all the basic scuba gear, including my regulator, buoyancy control device (BCD), and my tank so that I was feeling confident with the essentials.Read More: Everything You Need to Know about Getting PADI Diver CertifiedOn the second and third days, I did two dives per day. Each one was focused on different skills that I had to show my instructor I had mastered. Fortunately, Desa was there every step of the way to help, and remind me (and sometimes laugh at me!).If you’re headed to Thailand, I’d highly recommend getting over to Koh Tao to do some diving. Roctopus has an awesome dive shop where you can get set up and, of course, check out their Open Water or Advanced Certification courses.Learn more about Roctopus Dive here!Thank you to Roctopus Dive for hosting me during my diving course.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-island-hopping-in-thailand/,The Ultimate Guide to Island Hopping in Thailand,Thailand,"Updated: December 2019Thailand is an amazing destination that has a lot to offer a traveler, whether you’re staying for just a week, or are taking a long-term exploration of the country.The islands in Thailand are famous for their wonderful beaches, laid-back vibe and excellent activities, such as scuba diving.The area is inexpensive when you compare it to other tropical island chains- I managed a budget as low as $20 a day. If you travel at the right time of year, you will find that island hopping is a great way to take in this stunning part of the country.Here’s my ultimate guide to island hopping in Thailand!My Thailand Island Hopping ItineraryTo help inspire your trip planning, here’s a rough outline of my personal itinerary from backpacking in Thailand a few years ago. I’ve included how many days I spent in each destination, how I traveled from one destination to the next and the price of transportation.Fly Bangkok to Phuket (Around $150)Phuket – 1 nightFerry to Koh Phi Phi (Less than $10 for a boat)Koh Phi Phi – 3 nightsFerry to Krabi (Haggle for the best price. Less than $10)Krabi – 2 nightsBus and Ferry to Koh Samui (Less than $15)Koh Samui – 3 nightsFerry to Koh Pha Ngan (Less than $10)Koh Pha Ngan – 3 nightsFerry to Koh Tao (Less than $10)Koh Tao – 2-3 nightsOvernight bus to Bangkok (Less than $20)Bangkok – 3 nights   Traveling from Bangkok to PhuketMost people who arrive into Thailand will connect through Bangkok and will start their hopping loop in Phuket, as I did.There are several different ways to get from Bangkok to Phuket, and while bus options are usually the cheapest, costing the equivalent of around $20, they also can take up to thirteen hours, and often will be in fairly cramped conditions.Traveling by train and then a shorter bus will usually be around six hours, and cost the equivalent of around $30, while a flight is the quickest way, and usually costs around the equivalent of $50 if booked in advance.Although the plane is clearly the quickest, the railway and bus journey offer interesting scenery while also being a more environmentally friendly way to travel.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Thailand10 Tips For Your First Trip to Thailand    Top Destinations to Include on Your TripPhuketWhile Phuket was my least favorite destination on my trip based on Patong Beach’s huge backpacker party scene, it’s well worth renting a private villa in a more remote area. Patong beach does have an amazing weekend night market which I highly recommend visiting!Koh Phi PhiThis is the natural next stop on your island hopping adventure when leaving Phuket, with a regular ferry service provided by several companies between the two islands. There’s excellent scuba diving and individual Phi Phi islands (including the famous “Beach” movie location).Koh SamuiMost people will pop back to the mainland in Krabi after Koh Phi Phi, and take a bus to head by ferry over to Koh Samui. Idyllic beaches such as Lipa Noi are found here, and there are countless activities like a day trip to Big Buddha Temple and Na Muang Waterfall.Koh Pha NganKoh Pha Ngan is well-known for the Full Moon Party, which is a monthly festival that draws in thousands of people from around the world to the beach for a world-famous dance party.Koh TaoKoh Tao is an inexpensive ferry ride from Ko Pha Ngan, taking around an hour and a quarter. This is an island where you can really get into contact with nature, whether it’s helping with sea turtle rehabilitation or learning to scuba dive.Read More:10 Local Foods to Try in ThailandThe Solo Female Traveler's Guide to Thailand Staying Safe As You Explore The IslandsIt is important to be careful when you are island hopping, as the ferries between each island may be inexpensive, but they don’t always have the best safety record.Ensure that you have a look at the ferry to check there are sufficient lifeboats and that it isn’t too crowded before boarding, and if you have any doubts, it may be best to go with another ferry company.Thai people are generally very friendly, hence the nickname “The Land of Smiles,” but always use your best judgment. Also, Thai drug laws are also incredibly strict, so don’t take any risks. "

It’s ideal for someone who wants to really experience a vibrant cultural destination with a wide range of sightseeing options.The country truly is amazing. It’s also something of a travel hub for the whole of South East Asia, with flights to Thailand departing every day, since it’s so easy to reach: grab that opportunity and go and see this amazing place!There are many opportunities to make friends and meet locals, and the advantage of traveling alone is that you can grab every opportunity, change your plans when you like, and you don’t have to worry about anybody else.Head for BangkokYou have to see it to believe it: Bangkok is a bustling modern city in a world where ancient traditions mix alongside the cutting edge modern world. You’ll find monks with iPhones, and bars filled with tourists and locals mingling together.Make sure you try Thai street food from one of the countless street stalls. Not only is it cheap, but it’s also tasty: try the Pad Thai, the soups, the duck and everything you can!Go to AyutthayaThis is the former capital of Thailand and can be accessed as a day trip from Bangkok, on an organized trip if you’d rather not make the journey alone. There are ancient ruins, Buddhist temples and fabulous scenery which will take your breath away.Photo by Elephant Nature ReserveChill Out in Chiang MaiMore relaxed than Bangkok, you can really experience Thailand here in the beautiful mountainous scenery. There are many festivals throughout the year, along with opportunities for activities including volunteering at an elephant nature reserve.Please note, it is NEVER okay to ride elephants, even if staff may tell you otherwise. Please be responsible tourists!Getting Around ThailandLocal buses are often the easiest option, with tuk-tuks usually the most expensive transport choice — but that’s certainly an experience!

https://theblondeabroad.com/beginners-guide-thai-street-food/,The Beginner’s Guide to Thai Street Food,Thailand,"I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a bit intimidated by the offerings of street vendors upon arriving in Thailand. Why is that rice purple? What’s inside that banana leaf? How do I eat a whole fish on a stick?Is that a fried cockroach?!Lucky for me, I had my lovely Thai friend, Apple, to show me the ropes while traveling through Thailand- educating me on the spicy, sour, sweet and strange eats that lay before me.While cuisine varies throughout the different regions of Thailand, this guide will provide first-time travelers to Thailand some insight into Thai street food culture.TipsThai street food is cheap cheap cheap! Even street vendors that get a lot of tourist traffic typically won’t charge more than 30-60 baht ($1-2 USD) for their offerings.If you venture into a truly Thai market void of tourists, you can eat like a king for just a few dollars. Eating from street vendors helped me manage a budget of $20 a day in Thailand!If you LOVE spicy food, like yours truly, be warned that “Thai spicy” is an entirely different level of HOT. I went to a locals’ spot and ordered as the locals do (despite some serious discouragement from the vendor).I couldn’t even sit near my food because the steam from my dish caused me to tear up and cough uncontrollably. If you wanna play it safe, order without spice and add some chile sauce later.Speaking of chile sauce, Thai food culture is all about customization. On the makeshift tables of street vendors, you’ll notice a caddy of four condiment jars filled with some interesting concoctions.Typically, you’ll find jars of sugar, fish sauce, a chili/garlic/vinegar sauce and dried chile flakes. You can also request Nam Pla Prik which is a fish sauce with chiles, garlic and lime—and it’s the bomb.com.Some Thai food can also be REALLY sweet. Like stomach-ache sweet.When ordering a Thai iced tea (my favorite) or Thai iced coffee, they normally add a ton of sweetened condensed milk. They might be surprised, but request a “little” bit of the sweetener, taste test, then ask for more if you wish.Thai iced tea (cha yen) is not like American iced tea. It’s a creamy orange-colored beverage sent from heaven and it might just change your life.If you have a sweet tooth, you’re in luck! Thai desserts can be found in every color and shape imaginable, but you might not immediately recognize them as sweets.Thai marzipan is made from mung beans and is sculpted and painted to look like little glossy fruits and vegetables.Sticky rice is covered in coconut milk and served with fresh slices of mango. And rice is topped with a sweet custard and served up like a little present inside a banana leaf.Thailand is known as “The Land of Smiles,” but I also like to think of it as “The Land of Spoons.” There are a few things to know about Thai eating etiquette.Remember: No chopsticks. No knives. Fork, spoon, and fingers.Don’t put the fork in your mouth. Use the fork to scoop the food into the spoon and eat from the spoon. It is also customary to eat rice by rolling it into a bite-sized ball with your fingers using only your right hand.Yes. Those are bugs! While I didn’t actually try any bugs in Thailand, they are quite commonly found fried up at markets. The ever-popular giant water bug looks like a big ol’ cockroach.I found out later that their essence is commonly used in my favorite Nam Pla Prik chile sauce. So, I guess they can’t be that bad! Right?!There’s no such thing as “breakfast” in Thailand. While we might be familiar with eggs for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch and steak and potatoes for dinner, there is little contrast in the types of food served throughout the day in Thailand.Breakfast offerings typically include savory items like noodle soups or a plastic bag of pork or beef with sticky rice. If you can’t wrap your head around soup for breakfast, pick up some fresh fruit, a fruit smoothie or a Thai iced coffee.Do you have a favorite Thai dish?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/shop-shop-bangkok/,Visiting the Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok,Thailand,"Visiting the Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok is retail heaven. As soon as I walked in I just about died from excitement!Anything you could possibly think of is sold at this market. So, if you wanna bring home a little somethin somethin, definitely plan on coming here. I grabbed some mango and sticky rice, put on my game face and got to work.Thai Sticky Rice & MangoInteresting Facts about the Chatuchak MarketChatuchak Weekend Market (or Jatujak Market) is one of the world’s largest weekend markets and covers an area of 35 acres with more than 15,000 booths selling goods from every part of Thailand. (source)The market has over 200,000 visitors each day (SAT-SUN) with 70% being Thai and 30% foreign. (source)Almost everything can be found here at a bargaining local price (not a tourist price), and most vendors actually come from local factories or are local artisans. (source)If you can dream it up, Chatuchak Market likely has it. Here, you will be amazed at the incredible variety of goods, whether it’s a Thai lantern, an antique painting, a stylish new pair of jeans or, for something more exotic, a new pet snake.Thai Sticky Rice & Mango VendorWhat is for Sale?As I already mentioned, if you can dream it up, you can likely find it at Chatuchak!I could not believe my eyes. You could buy a pet squirrel on a string, nibble on some fried insects, have a local artist hand paint anything you want, take home a giant goldfish, score some new leather kicks… I’d honestly have an easier time listing things you couldn’t find there.There were even companies there to arrange international shipping for big spenders. I had some self-control and left with my dignity, some trinkets, and enough Thai Baht to get me through the rest of my stay in Thailand.Giant Goldfish for SaleNavigating the Chatuchak MarketWith 35 acres of retail heaven ahead, I knew I could easily spend a day (or 3) at the market. For first-timers like me, navigating Chatuchak seems impossible. Luckily, the market is grouped into 27 sections based on category, so if you’re looking for something in particular, you can find the exact location on a map.My advice, if you’re going for the first time, is to get lost. You’ll be enchanted by the colors and smells surrounding you and your senses will be on their own adventure.While it’s a bit of a maze, enjoy the experience and you’re sure to stumble upon some seriously good surprises.Fried bugs anyone?Bargaining TipsAs someone raised by frugal parents, I’ve always been pretty good at finding a good deal and knowing a fair price when I see one. I turned on haggle mode and spent about 3 hours weaving and bobbing through the crammed aisles of goodies like an experienced gypsy.At one point I almost caught a case of overstimulation but luckily found the strength to go on.Don’t head immediately head to Chatuchak if it’s your first time in Bangkok or Thailand. It’s best to do some exploring and price shopping around the city to see what “the going rate” for certain goods are and what a fair price is.Be wary of overpriced goodies in Bangkok but also realize that you are a visitor to this country. Respect the culture, recognize that people are trying to make a living, and go and get your shop on!Shop til ya drop!Helpful TipsLocation: Take the skytrain (BTS) to Mo Chit station, take exit no. 1 and follow the crowd until you see rows of street vendors. Keep walking and the entrance will be on the right.Hours: SAT-SUN 9:00 am – 6:00 pm"
https://theblondeabroad.com/land-of-smiles-to-the-kingdom-of-wonder/,From the Land of Smiles to the Kingdom of Wonder,Thailand,"My last morning in Thailand, the “Land of Smiles” was definitely bittersweet. I set out to find the last of my desired swag from the local market and grab my last Thai meal. I walked to Sri Mariamman Temple, a Hindu temple, to pay my last respects to the beautiful country of Thailand that I’ve spent the last two weeks growing to love.Sri Mariamman Temple in BangkokI had been looking for a specific Ganesha pendant my entire trip in Thailand since I first saw it in Krabi and decided not to buy it. Ganesha is the Hindu elephant God widely known as the “Remover of Obstacles.”Throughout my yoga and spiritual practice, I’ve always had a strong connection with this particular figure and wanted to keep something with me along my travels. When I got to the temple I looked at the charms and trinkets they had and, sure enough, there was my Ganesha pendant.After stringing it onto my necklace, I bought my last Thai iced coffee, my last grilled plantain, and my last “folded pancake like taco filled with marshmallow cream and shredded coconut” thing I can’t pronounce in English.I made my way back to the hostel to say my final farewell to Apple, her sister, Katy, and Sevi. After meeting Apple on the flight from Melbourne to Bangkok, meeting Sevi and Katy in Koh Phi Phi, and reuniting again in Koh Phangan, we somehow managed to all meet up in Bangkok one last time. There was never really a need for goodbye until today.We hugged it out, and Lindsay and I were on our way.Our last day in Bangkok togetherI must admit our airport experience was seriously amateur. We arrived 3 hours early and managed to almost miss our flight. After checking in, we got comfortable and grabbed some lunch, organized our things, took a survey for some local kids (while they snuck our photos), wasted time, and didn’t even think about going through customs!Twenty minutes before our boarding time, reality bashed me upside the head as I realized we are most likely going to miss our flight.Getting interviewed by students at the Bangkok AirportWe booked it to the international departures line and waited and waited. We finally made it through security and got through quicker than we anticipated. Thinking we had plenty of time before boarding, we stopped to smell colognes and browse the duty free shops. We then decided to head to our gate at 21C.Wait… There’s no 21C???Gate: Seat: 21C – Easily confused!We checked our tickets again and, sure enough, we had read the seat number. We ran to the departures screen and we realized our plane was literally on the other side of the terminal and it was reading “FINAL CALL.”*Insert cuss word here*We sprinted down the terminal for what seemed like forever, lugging all of our bags, until we got to our gate. There were about four employees waiting and, upon seeing us, smiled in relief and rushed us through.You’ve got to appreciate a culture known for smiling even in times when you’ve pulled a major blonde moment!Brushing up on what to do in CambodiaWhen we boarded the plane, there was this strange steam coming from the overhead bins. We figured it was some sort of fragrant incense. At first we questioned whether or not it was laughing gas but apparently AirAsia goes a step above the rest to ensure a comfortable flight.It was only an hour flight to Phnom Penh, Cambodia but we saw some of the most beautiful cloud formations I’ve ever seen on a flight!Flying above ThailandAfter landing, we had to get our Cambodian visas.Apparently, I was supposed to carry some extra passport size photos with me. Noted. Also, Cambodia uses US dollars! Noted yet again. I started feeling seriously unprepared for Cambodia.Now… What to do with the 14,000 Thai baht I have on me?We decided to catch a night bus to Siem Reap so as not to waste any time and get a full day in at Angkor Wat in the morning. A lovely Spanish couple, Carlos and Sara, approached us outside the airport to organize the adventure together.Monkeys on a wire in Phnom PenhWe all got a cab to the bus station and booked an 8:30 pm bus to Siem Reap. After eating dinner, we boarded our bus for the 6 hour trek up north. I had many friends tell me how rough the roads were here, but that’s a serious understatement!Imagine 3 ft diameter potholes every couple of feet and driving straight through them at 30 mph!Anyways, thanks to my friend Cody’s recommendation, we booked a hostel in Siem Reap and were picked up at 1:30 am when we arrived (complete with welcome sign).Welcome to Cambodia, the “Kingdom of Wonder!”The Temples of Angkor WatTraveling Thailand on $20 per DaySolo Travel in Thailand24 Hours in PhuketThe Beginner’s Guide to Thai Street Food Bangkok Travel TipsHow to Connect with Locals in Southeast AsiaPhi Phi Ley Island HoppingThe Chatuchak Weekend Market in Bangkok "
https://theblondeabroad.com/party-paradise-under-the-full-moon-in-thailand/,The Beginner’s Guide to The Full Moon Party in Thailand,Thailand,"I had heard many legendary stories of the infamous Full Moon Party, and I was NOT going to miss it when I made plans to travel to Thailand! The massive party takes place on a stretch of beach on Koh Pha Ngan (Koh Phangan) island in Thailand. Each month, on the night of the full moon, thousands of people come from all over the world to partake in the festivities and dance all night long.Here’s what to expect at The Full Moon Party in Thailand!My friend Lindsay and I took a morning ferry from Koh Samui to Koh Pha Ngan to partake in some pre-Full Moon Party festivities. We ended up meeting some awesome Italian guys on the ferry and made plans to meet up for the party that evening.I had also made some awesome new friends Sevi (from Germany) and Katy (from the UK), that I met while snorkeling in Koh Phi Phi, who were also in Koh Pha Ngan for the party. So, we all met up in Thang Sala to spend the day on the beach preparing for the party.That’s the beauty of traveling in Thailand. You meet SO many other travelers!Getting ThereDepending on where you’re coming from, the two closest islands to Kho Pha Ngan are Koh Samui and Koh Tao. There are inexpensive ferries running daily between all the islands.The actual beach party is located on Haad Rin beach on Koh Pha Ngan island.From Bangkok: The fastest way to Koh Pha Ngan is to take a short flight to Koh Samui and catch a ferry to the island. There are also budget-friendly overnight bus & boat options you can purchase from travel agents in Bangkok.Where to StayAccommodation typically books up solid on Koh Pha Ngan the week before and after the Full Moon Party. Book in advance to make sure you have somewhere to stay. Or, do what I did, and leave your bags at a friend’s hotel and stay out all night.After experiencing it, I would personally recommend finding accommodation on another island, catching a ferry to Koh Pha Ngan, partying all night, and catching a ferry back the next day.What to WearWe changed into our traditional, neon, Full Moon Party attire complete with fanny packs, enjoyed a couple of pre-moon drinks, and made our way to Haad Rin where the famous beach party takes place!Once in Haad Rin, we got the fun started! We began the artistic ritual of covering ourselves in neon paint. I went for a mysterious mustache and some beautifully painted vines down my arm.No need to pack anything special for the party! You can get all your FMP swag from street vendors for about USD $10-15.The Beach PartyOnce we were covered in paint, we made our way to the beach to get amongst the “wild & crazy.” Lindsay and I happened to run into the Italian guys from the ferry as soon as we got to the beach, so we all stuck together for the party experience of a lifetime.The beach was packed with people from all over the world, fire dancers, drink bucket stands, dance stages, DJ’s…you name it!All along the beach, there are vendor stands selling these little plastic buckets (the kind kids normally build sand castles with) made into giant cocktails with about five straws in them to share! They’re about 350 baht, or around USD $11 each.Do not attempt one of these alone…it’s a teamwork sort of drink!Helpful Tip: Plan on wearing sneakers, so you aren’t barefoot on the beach. While there isn’t really any glass being served, you still want to be careful not to step on anything that would hurt you.In addition to all the festivities, there were giant jump ropes lit on fire that five people could jump over at the same time, twirling fireballs on ropes, and people spinning fire poles.Having seen multiple people with bandages from burns on their feet, legs, and arms, I spared myself the exciting experience.I did, however, dance all night long until the wee hours of the morning. I have no idea how many buckets’o’drink we consumed throughout the night, but we danced until the sun came up!Is the Full Moon Party Just for Backpackers?Overall, the Full Moon Party is a crazy party made up of visitors from all around the world. As much as it is generalized that the crowd is mostly made up of young backpackers, I met people of all ages and from every background.You will, however, find a LOT of young, hard-partying Aussies and backpackers all over Thailand.Do you have tips for Thailand’s Full Moon Party?

It’s safe for travelers, has activities for all types of adventurers, and is very easy on the bank account.I wanted to share a fun-filled day that I had in Krabi, Thailand to show how easy it is to explore on as little as $20 a day. I noted how much I spent throughout the day so it’s easy to follow along. I’m still baffled by how inexpensive everything was!My Thai travel buddy, Apple, and I started the day off early in Aonang and rented a scooter for 24 hours (฿75 baht / $2.30 each). We stopped to grab breakfast at a locals restaurant before hitting the road and indulged in Thai iced coffees (my fav), seafood noodle soup, watermelon, and rice (฿60 baht / $1.80 each).Yes. You read right. Soup for breakfast. Welcome to Thailand!After stopping to fill up the tank (฿50 baht / $1.50 each), we drove about 45 km through winding jungle roads to the Tiger Cave Temple. We only had to stop about 5 times to ask for directions. Thank  goodness for Apple and her smooth talking Thai!Total spent so far: ฿185 baht / $5.60Once we got to the Tiger Cave Temple, we checked out the actual cave (FREE) and decided to climb the 1,237 stairs to the top of the mountain to check out the massive golden Buddha shrine and the incredible view looking down on Krabi.Let’s just say it was one of the most difficult hikes I’ve ever done.Each step was about twice as high as it was wide. So, we were literally side stepping up the side of the mountain.To add to the challenge, the humidity was NOT on our side!We got about halfway up when we were met by a bunch of monkeys. There had been warning signs everywhere advising tourists to avoid them and not feed because they are very territorial. So what do I do as a naive monkey lover? I stop for a photoshoot with a monkey and her tiny little baby.I mean… I had to.Next thing I know, a glass bottle hits my shoulder and shatters everywhere!A monkey had ran behind me and had thrown a glass bottle left by a construction worker at me (and I don’t think he was aiming for my shoulder)! We started sprinting up the stairs without looking back and just about fainted from exhaustion.Note: Warning signs are not suggestions.I have no idea how long it took us to actually reach the top, probably an hour, or maybe even two, but when we got there it was all worth it! We had a 360 degree view of the tropical mountains that stretched all the way to the ocean. We removed our shoes and walked around to pay respect to the beautiful giant golden statues and enjoy the cool breeze.After a major trek back down the mountain, we took the longest ride EVER back to Aonang. We pulled over for a quick meet and greet with some elephants and got back to our journey. Shortly after getting back on the road, a storm came in so we pulled over until the rain subsided.We hit the road again and, I won’t say we were lost, we just didn’t know where we were going.We stopped along the side of a random road for a bite to eat at a little hut packed with locals that had just finished up a days work. It was a typical Thai street food establishment, with local women making delicious food for local workers.It was the best meal I ate in Thailand!We got pumpkin and coconut soup, prawn and tofu spring rolls, fish cakes with sweet chili sauce, Pad Thai with prawns and a virgin coconut to sip on. We grabbed some red bean and coconut dessert and sweet virgin coconut spring roll balls with coconut milk for takeaway.ALL of this cost us only ฿50 baht / $1.50 each.Total spent so far: ฿235 baht / $7We made a stop at a little jewelry shop where I scored some beautiful pearl earrings for ฿150 baht / $4.50. We then stumbled upon a local market bustling with activity. Local vendors were selling everything from clothes to food.I happened to find some more awesome jewelry (three pairs of earrings for ฿110 baht / $3.30) and grabbed a bottle of fresh carrot juice for the morning (฿20 baht / $.60).We eventually made it back to Aonang for the sunset and gladly returned the scooter. We walked around town one last time before reaching the hotel and I picked up a few souvenir bracelets for my loves back home (฿130 baht / $4).The total spent on an adventurous and fun-filled day, including my new Thai jewelry, TONS of Thai food, a 24 hour scooter rental and gas…  ฿645 baht or about $20 USD!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/phi-phi-ley-island-hopping/,Phi Phi Leh Island Hopping,Thailand,"Updated: September 2019My amazing Thai-stralian travel companion, Apple, and I decided to book a full day snorkel trip to a few of the surrounding islands in Phi Phi Leh, Thailand. Because when in Thailand, it’s allllll about island hopping! However, when visiting the main Koh Phi Phi island, you’ll literally find hundreds of tour companies offering the same trip.Pro Tip: Don’t go with the first company!Shop around and see who offers you the best price. Most companies will be willing to lower their price if you know the “going” tour rates. There’s no need to book in advance or online, simply hit the street vendors and look around for the one that you like best.Want to start planning your trip? Use my experience of island hopping the Phi Phi Leh Islands as a guide!  Bring on the SnorkelingApple and I got into our bikinis, packed a day bag, and went straight to the beach to board our Thai longboat for a full day of snorkel adventures! The longboat was full of travelers from all over the world and we made quite a few friends with our boatmates.The first stop? Bamboo Island! The island felt completely deserted with only a number of boats in view…talk about paradise!We spent about an hour there, had a light lunch and soaked up the sun. Apple and I did a bit of exploring on the island enjoying our beautiful surroundings of crystal clear water and powder-white beaches.We slowly walked back to the longboat and soon realized our guide was struggling to start the engine! The Thai solution? Fit three longboat loads of people onto two.Let’s just say it made for an interesting and, to be quite honest, soaking wet trip across to the next island! We were all hiding behind whatever objects we could find—life vests, our bags, our friends…anything to keep the cold water from spraying us down and having the wind chill us!   Prepare to See All the Sealife!Our next stop was at Pi Leh Bay. The dramatic fjord-like bay has steep cliffs that hide an inlet, only accessible at high tide. The water was so clear and shallow all we had to do was hop off the boat and we were surrounded by a beautiful reef full of tropical fish.We made another short stop at Loh Samah and passed the 2 small rocky outcrop islands of Bida Nok and Bida Noi. We popped into the water frequently to explore life unda da sea! I swam with all kinds of fish, including the beautiful angelfish, and even saw a sea cucumber—such fascinating little sea creatures!One thing to make sure of when you’re in the sun and constantly dipping into the water? Reef-safe sunscreen!   Maya Bay  Maya BayWe rounded the cliffs to the jewel of the Phi Phi Leh collection, Maya Bay. Maya Bay is famous for the movie The Beach starring Leonardo Di Caprio. I had never actually seen the movie but, apparently, there’s a bit of Hollywood magic added to the film to make the bay appear like a closed-in lagoon.Honestly, I don’t think they needed that movie magic because it’s stunning on its own!After a short ride, we joined a bunch of other tourist-filled longboats and were then told to “jump in!” The boat had to stop about 100 meters out from a narrow opening in a cliff where we would have to swim in order to get to the beach.We found a net at the cliff opening that we had to climb up to get to a staircase to walk to the actual beach. The tide was so strong I actually got pushed up against the reef…battle wounds to prove it!That said, be mindful of the tide and possible rip currents because the water can be VERY strong!It’s hard to describe, but it felt like we were on a mission to discover a hidden treasure. After a bit of a walk, we finally arrived at the beach. And let me tell you: it was all worth it.Make Sure to Breathe in the SunsetDespite the increased amount of tourism the film brought to Maya Bay, it was an absolutely stunning beach—super fine sand and crystal clear water. Plus, the bay opens to the Andaman Sea in a glorious vista.After rolling around in the sand and letting ourselves get carried out by the ocean current, we made our journey back to the boat.We left Maya Bay just in time to watch the sunset as we crossed the open ocean heading back to the main dock. Again, I’m a huge sucker for sunsets. It was beautiful watching the shaded figures of longboats pass in front of the sun setting far off across the ocean.It was an amazing day full of ocean adventures. We later found out that there are different types of boats you can take out for similar tours, so if a rickety old low-sitting Thai longboat with a high likelihood of a breakdown isn’t your style, there are bigger luxury boats that will be sure to tickle your fancy.And, always remember, don’t drink and dive! Are you heading to Thailand soon? Particularly the surrounding islands in Phi Phi Leh? I’d love to hear what you have planned…and all about your experience thereafter in the comments below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/24-hours-in-phuket/,24 Hours in Phuket,Thailand,"I was so sad to be leaving Australia, especially after my adventures in Melbourne, but I was SO excited to start my adventure in Southeast Asia! I took a bus from Melbourne to the airport to catch my flight to Bangkok.On the bus ride over, I sat next to an awesome “Thai-stralian” girl named Apple who just happened to be on the same flight as mine. Apple had lived in Melbourne for the last four years and grew up in Thailand, so she was going home to visit her sister.We decided to check into our flights together so we could sit next to each other and bear the 10- hour flight to Bangkok.First off, checking into our flight was a nightmare! We were flying Jetstar and the girl checking us in was in training. After checking my passport, she asked me if I had my flight information leaving Thailand.I hadn’t booked anything because I didn’t have any set plans after Thailand. She said if I couldn’t show proof of exit I couldn’t board.WHAT?!I was literally sweating thinking that I was going to be stuck in Melbourne. That’s when my new friend Apple spoke up and said that it was no problem for me to fly to Thailand without proof of exit and that we needed to speak with a manager.After speaking with Customer Service, we got everything sorted out. It turns out, you don’t need to have travel plans to leave Thailand to enter; the girl in training and was just following protocol.So long Melbourne! Bangkok here I come!After a long flight, we didn’t end up landing in Bangkok until close to 11 pm. Apple, being the Thai speaking legend that she is, helped me get a SIM card for my iPad and service for my iPhone for less than $5. (Starting to like Thailand a LOT already!)You can pick these up in the airport FYI. Bangkok airport has EVERYTHING!We grabbed a glass of coconut juice and some Pad Thai in the airport. After having an awesome flight and meal together, Apple spontaneously decided to change her plans to join me on my trip. My first ever solo-trip and I already have a travel buddy!We decided to stay one night in Bangkok and catch a 7 am flight to Phuket in the morning. Once we got to our hotel in Bangkok, we booked a room at a hostel in Phuket.Ready to get to the beach!Flying over PhuketAfter landing in Phuket around 10 am we were picked up by the hostel car service and went to check in at Bodega Hostel in Patong. The hostel was awesome!We had a private room for under $10 each within walking distance of the beach and the main street where the nightlife goes off. We grabbed a Singha beer and some lunch and headed STRAIGHT for the beach.My first Singha and Pad Thai lunch in ThailandThe beach was packed with tourists, but we managed to grab some chairs, coconut oil (to ensure optimum bronzing), and a virgin coconut to sip on. After 6 weeks in an Australian winter, I was ready for sunshine and sand!It was so relaxing we both passed out and woke up near sunset. I have the sunburn to prove it.Patong Beach in PhuketBefore heading back to the hostel, we decided to indulge in some pampering and get a massage, manicure and pedicure. At the salons, they have these crazy “Doctor fish” in tanks that eat the dead skin off your feet!It was the weirdest feeling… like pins and needles all over our feet and legs.Doctor Fish PedicuresBut, they do a good job making your feet look pretty! We also got Thai oil massages and our nails were looking fabulous! We went back to our room to shower and get ready for dinner and a night out.For everyone visiting Thailand, do NOT just go to the tourist restaurants.You must go to the night markets where the locals go to grab amazing Thai street food. Not to mention, it is fresh and most items are only 20 baht (less than $1)!The amazing spread at the night marketWe went crazy getting our fix of the delicious Thai food and tried everything we could get our hands on from mushroom soup to sticky rice and mango to fresh crab & lime!We were so stuffed!Apple and her tasty rice and coconut dessertTo celebrate the commencement of our journey through Thailand we decided to give the backpacker bars a shot and go out to the main street to grabs drinks. It was absolutely crazy packed with backpackers everywhere you looked.I’m never a fan of these situations and would prefer a local’s spot over a backpackers spot any day but, when in Rome, as they say. It turned into a MUCH bigger night than anticipated, but isn’t that always the story?Typical Backpacker Bar in PatongThe next morning we were planning to go to Phi Phi. We woke up that morning to the hostel staff banging on our door “You going to Phi Phi?? Your bus is here!!!”Ahhh!We slept through our alarm and hadn’t repacked! We threw everything we could back into our suitcases and jumped in the bus taking us to the boat to go to Phi Phi. Onward we go!So, to sum up Patong in Phuket, it’s not really my cup of “Thai” tea. Without trying to sound too negative, Westerners have mostly taken over and it didn’t give me the best first-impression of Thailand.While there are beautiful beaches, they’re packed with tourists. 24 hours in Phuket was more than enough for me. I only speak for Patong as I’m sure there are really nice parts of Phuket where you can enjoy beaches peacefully, and immerse yourself into local culture.If you are looking to travel to really experience the true culture of Thailand, I wouldn’t put Patong at the top of your list.READ NEXT: Phi Phi Ley Island HoppingHave you been to Phuket?"
https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-turkey/,10 Local Foods to Try in Turkey,Turkey,"Turkish food as we know it today developed in the age of the Ottoman Empire as it expanded and came into contact with so many different influences. In modern Turkish food, you will find the flavors from the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Balkans.While Turkish food abroad tends to be heavy on meat, the native cuisine is heavily based around eggplant, garlic, lentils, zucchini, pistachios, and cheaters. It is really such a diverse blend of flavors. You will need to try at least a few dishes to get a real taste.Are you hungry yet? Here are my top ten foods to try in Turkey!Turkish DelightYou might have tried Turkish delight outside of Turkey, but you rarely get the good stuff abroad. Traditional Turkish delight sweets are made with the aromatic flavors of Bergamot orange, rosewater, mastic, or lemon.You will find shops selling Turkish delights in a rainbow of colors. They tend to be bite-sized so you can easily try them all!BaklavaFlaky, crispy, tender, and oh-so-sweet, baklava is everything dessert is meant to be. In Turkey, making baklava is an art form and every artist has their own signature. You will find baklava with walnuts, pistachios, or hazelnuts and a range of sweet flavors like honey, rosewater, or orange flower.SimitSome may refer to this as the love child of a pretzel and a bagel. These round and doughy carb delights are typically covered in sesame seeds.While they are good anytime, they are amazing if you can grab one while they are fresh from the oven. They’re the perfect snack to pick up while you’re walking around Istanbul!And they’re kind of fun to take photos of, don’t you think? 🙂KunefeIf you adore the idea of cheese as a dessert, it will be love at first sight when you lay eyes on kunefe! This sweet cheese pastry is made with shredded filo stuffed with melted cheese and soaked in a sweet syrup.

https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-time-to-travel-to-turkey/,The Best Time to Travel to Turkey,Turkey,"Turkey is a country that truly has it all and yet hasn’t made it on many bucket lists—it’s a place where history meets adventure. From its rugged coastlines to the lively city of Istanbul to vast deserts and “fairy chimneys,” the terrain will surprise and enchant you.Because it has such a diverse landscape, figuring out when to visit all depends on where you’re looking to go and what you’d like to do. While it has gotten a rep for being a summer destination, come winter the mountains are blanketed in beautiful snow.So whether you’re looking for a European winter wonderland or you’re looking to explore all the history of Istanbul, read on to find out the best time to travel to Turkey!  March to MayThe spring is the prime time to visit Turkey because of the beautiful weather and the long days. If you’re looking to explore the ancient ruins that dot the country, go from March to May. Come April, the tulip season has reached its peak and you can see thousands of colorful flowers throughout the parks and gardens.Because the weather is ideal, this is high season for places like Istanbul and Cappadocia. Many of the boutique hotels are fully booked and prices soar. If you’re looking to experience these cities during these months, it’s recommended to book far in advance.If you’re not looking to pay much or fight with crowds, it is the off-season for Aegean and Mediterranean beach resorts.Visit during May and you will get to experience the Hidrellez Festival, a celebration of the start of spring that involves street performances by traditional Turkish bands.  IstanbulJune to SeptemberJune to September marks summertime in Turkey which means hot weather, perfect for soaking up some sun on the Turquoise Coast or going for a dip in the Mediterranean. While this is the perfect time to work on your tan, the ancient sites offer little to no shade, making exploring a bit uncomfortable.This is also peak season for cruise ships at the coastal resorts. Popular ancient sites like Ephesus can be very busy so it’s best to plan a different time to see the iconic sites.If you can manage the heat, visiting Istanbul and Cappodocia are much more affordable and have smaller crowds and lines for admission to sites. Cappodocia is also covered in flowers, making it a beautiful time to hike the region.   October to NovemberFall is another wonderful time to explore. Although temperatures are still a bit warm at the beginning of September, come the middle of the month, temperatures begin to cool, making them similar to those of the spring. The only difference is that the days are a bit shorter and there’s a higher chance of rain.The busyness of summer dies down a bit and it’s a great time to see the cities and the ancient sites.The Turquoise Coast is also quieter and cheaper. However, prices still tend to be higher for boutique lodging in spots like Istanbul. Hotels along the Mediterranean tend to close by mid-October so if this is high on your to-do list, you’ll definitely want to arrive at the beginning of October.And for all you wine lovers out there, the International Festival of Wine takes place in Cappodocia at the end of October. You’ll find plenty of wine tasting events from local vineyards. The end of October brings Republic Day, where you’ll be able to witness firework displays.December to FebruaryThough Turkey may not seem like the place to get cold, the winter months can be quite chilly and rainy. Snowfall is not uncommon and creates beautiful views. Because of this colder weather, you won’t find many tourists wandering about.If you don’t mind a little cold, you can benefit from the lower prices, smaller crowds, and the best availability at hotels. In fact, you could save up to 75% on hotels, restaurants, and tours. Have you been to Turkey? If so, what time of the year did you go and what were the highlights for you?

https://theblondeabroad.com/20-photos-to-inspire-you-to-visit-istanbul/,20 Photos to Inspire You to Visit Istanbul,Turkey,"   In Istanbul, you will find a convergence of architecture, culture and trade routes from all over the world. Those elements create a vastly diverse, exciting melting pot with immense charm.I fell in love with the energy of this city, and would encourage anyone to visit Istanbul.Probably the most famous and iconic sight in Istanbul is commonly referred to as the Blue Mosque. It was built in 1616 and there are over 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles! In addition, there is the Hagia Sophia that has been standing for more than 1400 years.It served as an Orthodox Cathedral until 1453 until Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (who conquered Istanbul) converted it into a mosque.I spent 24 hours exploring Istanbul during a quick stopover, and one of my favorite stops was the Grand Bazaar. It is one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world. Built in 1461, the market stretches 61 streets and consists of over 3,000 shops!Read More: The Best Time to Travel to TurkeyIt’s an overload of the senses and truly shows the local culture and camaraderie.While you’re visiting, you’ll have to try some of the best food in Istanbul. Grab a customary simit (sesame seed crusted bread rings) or an incredible pide (Turkish pizza) for under $2 USD. For breakfast, opt for “menemen”, the Turkish take on an morning egg dish.And of course, a trip to Istanbul wouldn’t be complete without a stop for a cup of Turkish coffee. You’ll find that Turkish coffee is a bit thicker in consistency than espresso and has a distinct flavor of cardamom. It can be an acquired taste for some, but definitely worth a try!For a special treat, and a lesser-known tourist attraction, take a cruise up the Bosphorus strait and get incredible views from the waterway.If you didn’t know, Istanbul is the only city in the world that is split between two continents, so the Bosphorus strait divides the city into an European and Asian part. A cruise or ferry can take you to the Asian part, and I’d recommend spending some time in Kadikoy. You’ll witness a whole different atmosphere, mix of architecture, an authentic culture, and with that, different kinds of food and markets!Check out my video on exploring Istanbul in a day!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/find-best-food-istanbul/,Where to Find the Best Food in Istanbul,Turkey,"There is so much controversy, there are so many feuds, there is so much fire and passion in Istanbul.In recent weeks this city has been in the spotlight, very unfortunately for tragedy, rather than for the beauty and energy that co-exists amongst its people, often times pledging to move forward, no matter what circumstances are that arise around them.Istanbul is a moving, wonderful city, one which I would encourage anyone to go to and experience. It is also a juxtaposition of itself in so many ways; Old City versus New City, traditional versus liberal, European versus Asian.The food too can be described in much of the same way; you can easily grab a customary simit (sesame seed crusted bread rings) for $1 or an incredible pide (Turkish pizza) for a mere $2, or you can indulge in a Michelin starred tasting menu high above the city and spend just as you would in NYC.This last trip was my second time in Istanbul, and because of that I got to go a little further beneath the surface than the first time around, staying in an Airbnb and having drinks with the owner, stumbling onto streets I hadn’t previously seen.Still, I know I’ve barely scratched the surface of this complex and varied city, both in terms of culture and of course, as well as food.Here’s where I found the best food in Istanbul!Read More: 10 Local Foods to Try in Turkey– Lades –Menemen is a Turkish take on breakfast- eggs, onion, tomato, green pepper and spices, mixed together and served in a cast iron pot. I knew I wanted to try this, so I headed to this very basic, very traditional lokanta (another word for restaurant in Turkey).Found, though not easily, on a side street off of the bustling Istikil strip, Lades serves mostly meats and eggs. It is no frills, but is a long-standing, tasty and reliable look into the way the locals do it in Istanbul. – Ciya Sofrasi –While I will travel to great lengths for food, it’s not everyday I hop a ferry in order to do so. To get to the Asian side of Istanbul, you need to travel by boat across the Bosphorus strait.Many tourists do not make or have the time to cross the border when only visiting the city for a couple of days, so the area of Kadikoy maintains a very authentic feel, housing dozens of open air shops, markets, restaurants, fish stands and olive bodegas. The cuisine here mimics this semblance, with Ciya Sofrasi being at the forefront.As is the case in a lot of Turkish restaurants, mezes are the main attraction. It’s a fun lunch experience here- you look at that day’s option, point at what you’d like, grab a table outside, and settle in to watch a very different sort of world go by.– Halil Lahmacun –Also on the Asian side, this is where I had my first taste of a $2 pide. Halil Lahmacun is a hole in the wall which makes these traditional treats on the spot, kneading the dough on demand and warming it in the brick oven as you watch.Mine was made with cheese, parsley, and pesto- I’d eat one every day if I could.– Limonlu Bache –Recommended by the lovely woman who owed my humble AirBnB apartment, Limonlu Bache is a charming, albeit large garden space that you would never know existed from the steep streets of the Beyoglu area.I went here to check out what she referred to as an “Istanbul hipster scene,” and not actually to have any food for once.What I did have though was Ayran, a thick drink comprised of yogurt, mint and cucumber, that is traditional and refreshing and offered nearly everywhere. Essentially, it tastes like tzatziki in a glass- nothing wrong with that.– Van Kahvalti Evi –If I lived in Istanbul, I’d come here often. Completely simple, filled with locals and visitors alike, Van Kahvalti Evi offers a perfect take on the infamous Turkish breakfast. The traditional breakfast platter- eggs, honey, jams, multiple cheeses, dips, breads, simit- will not steer you wrong.– Pandeli –Despite my hours of research before I left for Istanbul, Pandeli was not initially in the mix. As often, amazingly, happens to me- when a friend from London realised I was this city she immediately connected me with a local friend, and to Pandeli he sent me.I was kind of skeptical at first, as Pedali is located on top of the massive Spice Market on the Sultanahmet (Old City) side of the water. This to me, screamed touristy and stay away. I went anyway as he was persistent with his suggestion, and immediately upon walking in I knew it was a good move.The bright blue tiled walls leading up a narrow stairway and continuing literally all over the interior of the restaurant itself were spectacular, and unbelievably striking and absorbing. I felt I had stepped back in time into a land I was completely unfamiliar with, and I loved it.The food was simple but incredibly well done.– Mikla –20 stories high above the sprawling city, Mikla is on the top floor of the Marmara Pera Hotel in the hills of Beyoglu.Before you sit, the well manicured staff is insistent that you go yet one floor higher and grab a drink at the rooftop bar. Doing this should not be optional.Glass of red wine in hand, I could not get over the incredible 360 nighttime view of this dazzling, brightly lit scene in front of me. It puts you in a daze before you even begin to eat, and greatly sets the vibe for the evening ahead. I loved the food, which too delivered in richness, creativity, and display throughout the night.READ NEXT: The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Istanbul Read MoreTen Essential Tips For Solo Female TravelersThe Ultimate Guide to Solo Female Travel6 Fears You Face as a Solo Female TravelerTen Mistakes Made by Solo Female TravelersWhy NOW Is The Best Time for Americans to TravelHow to Avoid Overpacking for a TripThe Ultimate Travel Gear Packing GuideSHOP my favorite travel essentials!/* <![CDATA[ */ // <![CDATA[ !function(doc,s,id){ var e, p, cb; if(!doc.getElementById(id)) { e = doc.createElement(s); e.id = id; cb = new Date().getTime().toString(); p = '//shopsensewidget.shopstyle.com/widget-script.js?cb=1468626120684?cb=' + cb; e.src = p; doc.body.appendChild(e); } if(typeof window.ss_shopsense === 'object'){ if(doc.readyState === 'complete'){ window.ss_shopsense.init(); } } }(document, 'script', 'shopsensewidget-script'); // ]]&gt; /* ]]> */ "

Agora Guesthouse is another great, reputable option that offers bunks for $21-31 USD per night.

The Grand Bazaar was amazing—it’s one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world.I highly recommend finding a group tour, like this one or this one. It’s perfect for solo female travelers that are limited on time, and for anyone that might feel more comfortable getting their bearings of the city with the help of a guide.

You’ll learn more about history, culture, local life, plus get fed all day long.For a special treat, and a lesser-known tourist attraction, take a cruise up the Bosphorus strait and get incredible views from the waterway.Istanbul is the only city in the world that is split between two continents, so the Bosphorus Strait divides the city into a European and Asian part. A cruise or ferry can take you to the Asian part, and I’d recommend spending some time in Kadikoy. You’ll witness a whole different atmosphere, a mix of architecture, an authentic culture, and with that, different kinds of food and markets!Food in IstanbulTurkish cuisine is very diverse, and Istanbul is a melting pot of cultures, so you can see these influences together in their cuisine and street food scene.Since I don’t eat meat, I was limited to what traditional Turkish dishes I could try, but there are plenty of dishes for all types of diets in Istanbul.Here is some traditional food you should definitely try:Çiğ Köfte: Traditionally, this dish is served as a type of raw meat tartare. But, nowadays, it’s made in a vegetarian style and can be found throughout Istanbul.Lahmacun: A type of Turkish Pizza that can typically be ordered with a variety of toppings. Great for all types of foodies!Kokoreç: Though I didn’t try this, my local friend in Istanbul said this is one of his favorite foods. It’s essentially a meat sandwich made from lamb intestines, but tastes better than it sounds!Adana Durum: A very traditional meat kebab.Balik Ekmek: A really yummy fish sandwich.And of course, a trip to Istanbul wouldn’t be complete without a stop for a cup of Turkish coffee. You’ll find that Turkish coffee is a bit thicker in consistency than espresso and has a distinct flavor of cardamom. It can be an acquired taste for some, but definitely worth a try!Read More: 10 Local Foods to Try in TurkeyGetting Around IstanbulThe public transportation network in this huge city can be confusing at times, with a large range of routes, and a variety of options ranging from the subway, buses, trams, overland trains and even ferries that take people to different parts of the city.The Istanbulkart is the best way to pay for your transport, as it is a refillable card, and covers all of the main public transport options. If you are traveling with a friend or your family, you can tap for different people with the same card, so it makes getting around with groups much easier.Taxis should be fairly inexpensive, but be wary of drivers who try to negotiate fixed fares or those who try to shortchange you.Helpful  TipMake sure you have plenty of smaller currency bills to pay for taxis if you decide to go that route!Safety Tips for Women Traveling in IstanbulOne of the things the biggest things I want to highlight, especially for solo female travelers, is that Istanbul has a dedicated Tourism Police department that is located between Hagia Sofia and the Basilica Cistern. If something should go wrong, this is the place you want to go to!Istanbul is generally pretty safe and petty crime is low. However, be careful around the Old Town as pickpocketing and bag snatching can happen.Avoid hanging out solo in Taksim late at night (after 10 pm), especially on the main street Istikal Cadessi. It’s also advisable to not go solo there on the weekends. Men won’t grab you, but they can give intimidating looks.High heels and mini-skirts should also not be worn around town. You will see many local girls dressed in all types of outfits, but it’s best to avoid any unwanted attention.Don’t miss my packing list for conservative countries, and outfit inspiration.Be aware that there are several scams that look to target tourists, and when it comes to taxis, always examine the meter and don’t agree to pay any fixed fees. Choosing an older taxi driver is usually a safer bet, as they tend to be less likely to try and defraud passengers.As with any solo travel in a big city, it is wise not to get too intoxicated or to leave yourself vulnerable in bars and clubs. I recommend always ensure you have a friend to travel back to the hostel or hotel with if you are going out at night, or let someone know where you will be going.And lastly, I would recommend learning a few key phrases in Turkish, like “hello,” “thank you,” etc. as it goes a long way with taxi drivers and in bars/restaurants.What to Expect from Men in IstanbulThe culture in Istanbul is very different than most western countries. In many of the tourist areas of Istanbul, there will be men who approach female visitors or follow them in an uncomfortable manner.I personally never experienced any problems with local men and found those that I encountered to be very gentlemanly and polite.However, if you do encounter anyone like this, tell them firmly to leave you alone, and, if they persist, go to an area where there are a lot of people. Approaching members of the tourist police is always a good idea in this kind of situation."

https://theblondeabroad.com/istanbul-in-a-day-with-walks-of-turkey/,Istanbul in a Day,Turkey,"With less than 2 days to spend in Istanbul, I felt overwhelmed with what to put on my itinerary. There’s so much to see and do in the city and I wanted to see it all. So with careful planning and lots of walking (I’m talking OVER 13 miles), I managed to see all the highlights of Istanbul in just one day.Here are some of the highlights from Istanbul in a day!The Blue MosqueOne of the most famous and iconic destinations for tourists in Istanbul is commonly referred to as the Blue Mosque. It was built in 1616 and there are over 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles!The Grand BazaarOne of my favorite stops was the Grand Bazaar. It is one of the oldest and largest covered markets in the world – built in 1461, stretching 61 streets and consisting of over 3,000 shops!Istanbul by RooftopThe best way to see Istanbul is from a rooftop and there is no shortage of epic opportunities in the city. Most rooftop locations are safely guarded by locals, so it was an amazing experience to have one all to myself.Hagia SofiaHagia Sophia has been standing for more than 1400 years. It served as an Orthodox Cathedral until 1453 until Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II (who conquered Istanbul) converted it into a mosque.During the conversion, the Sultan covered the religious symbols rather than removing them, so today visitors can witness a unique monument that straddles time and religion.Turkish Coffee StopA trip to Istanbul wouldn’t be complete a pit stop for a cup of Turkish coffee. Turkish coffee is the rocket fuel of caffeinated concoctions. It’s a bit thicker in consistency than espresso and has a distinct flavor of cardamom.The grounds left after drinking Turkish coffee can also be used for fortune-telling! Be sure to read my The Solo Female Traveler’s Guide to Istanbul for more tips and recommendations!

https://theblondeabroad.com/best-time-to-go-on-safari-in-africa/,The Best Time to Go on Safari in Africa by Month,Tanzania,"Since moving to South Africa, going on safari has become one of my favorite things to do. From South Africa to Kenya and beyond, the continent has such raw, natural beauty. And Africa has way more diversity than you might think!Far from a one size fits all experience, you can choose the best safari experience in Africa for you and your travel style.I’ve been lucky enough to explore the African bush a few times and experience some of the best safari destinations in Africa. I absolutely adore interacting nature this way and seeing animals in their natural habitats.Of course, if you’re a shutterbug like yours truly, an African safari is a must. You’ll be traveling through some of the most beautiful landscapes on earth. African safari photography will take your snaps to the next level.Before you go, check out some of my essential reads for everything you need to know before your first African safari. I’m talking crucial info like how to budget for an African safari and what to pack for a safari.Curious as to when the best time to go on safari is? Because there are so many places to choose from and seasonal differences, I’m breaking it down by month!   Where to Go + WhyPeople often ask me about the best time to go on safari and the top places to check out. The truth is that it totally depends—an African safari is highly seasonal and location dependent.The time of year impacts migration, how wet or dry the land is, and ultimately which animals you are going to see (which is a HUGE factor).The easiest way to decide where to go on safari is to figure out when you’re going. Once you know which month you want to visit Africa, you can start researching where to go on safari.So, animal lovers, here are the best times to go on safari in Africa, based on the month!Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African Safari  JanuaryThis is the heart of the rainy season in many of the top safari hotspots—which is not necessarily a bad thing! Rain provides a lush green landscape and there are a few detours you can take to get to dry land.UgandaJanuary is actually the dry season in Uganda so the days are typically warm and sunny, though you’ll want to pack a raincoat for visits around the Volcanoes National Park. It’s prime time for gorilla trekking, which makes this one of the best times to visit Uganda, in my opinion.KenyaIt’s also the dry season in Kenya, which means that the bush and grass are all quite short. This is an advantage in seeing local wildlife. Maasai Mara is one of the most beautiful places in Africa and this is one of the best times to see it.South AfricaIt is the wet season in South Africa so pack a raincoat. Animals are on the move so you will need to be strategic to find them. Explore Sabi Sands near the Mozambique border or head down to Cape Town. Kruger National Park is an amazing safari park right outside of the city.This is especially great for a first safari because you can explore the bright lights of the big town, then simply hop in the car to go for a day trip to Kruger National Park. The animal sightings are just as impressive but there’s less need to rough it or pay for a pricey lodge out in the countryside.TanzaniaJanuary is the end of the rainy season and it is one of the premier months for spotting migrating wildebeest, zebra, and gnu, especially near the southern Ndutu and Salei plains.  UgandaFebruaryLike January, you will run into some rainy spots while exploring much of Africa in February. It is the best time of year to go on a safari though if you are interested in seeing baby animals (and who isn’t?)!South AfricaFebruary is a warm but rainy summer month in South Africa. The beloved Garden Route that runs from Mossel Bay in the west to Storms River in the east is lush and green. Make a stop in Knysna for a perfect base to explore. Make your way up to Kruger National Park to see the Big 5, or come down to Cape Town for an urban wonderland.KenyaBaby animals! Need I say more?For your very own cuteness overload, February is the time to visit Kenya, Tanzania, or Uganda to see adorable little guys of all shapes and sizes. February is also good because it is a hot and dry time that will bring out big game and birds in places like Maasai Mara and Laikipia. Safaris will take you to the animals’ fave water spots where they love to hang out. Keep an eye out for wild cats too during this time!TanzaniaWhile the southern part of the country is too hot and humid for me, I love northern Tanzania during February. Almost half a million wildebeest are born in this single month in Tanzania! You will find cheetahs all over the Serengeti while you ooh and ahh at all the little babies. Best of all, the rain passes by Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya during February so it’s prime time for a visit here.Uganda and RwandaThe warm and dry weather makes perfect gorilla trekking conditions! Just be aware that the later you go in February, the more likely you are to run into rain, especially near Volcanoes National Park.Helpful Tip:While I’d recommend seeing as much of Africa as you can during your trip, this isn’t the time to visit Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, or Namibia if you’re interested in seeing big game. These areas are pretty quiet in February.  MarchFrankly, March isn’t the best time of year for a safari in the majority of Africa. That said, if March is your only available time, there are definitely a couple of places where you can make it work.TanzaniaThe rainy reason is just starting and migration is at its peak. I would highly recommend checking out the Serengeti during the famous Great Migration. It’s also a chance to see the little newborn wildebeests discovering their new world right alongside you.South AfricaThe weather is still good in South Africa in March and it’s a dream season to drive along the renowned Garden Route. It is also a perfect time to visit Kruger and Sabi Sands, though you’ll want to avoid areas close to Botswana and Zambia as they’re both pretty likely to be rained out.  RIVER CRUISE AT MENO A KWENA, BotswanaAprilApril showers bring May…tigers! The continent is washed over in April. Vegetation is ultra lush, which is beautiful but makes it harder to see the animals.Since water is plentiful, animals don’t need to congregate in any particular watering hole because water is all over. This can make animals hard to see in many countries. There are a few key spots that are at their best in April though.BotswanaWith the rivers full to the brim, this is the perfect time to explore the Okavango Delta and visit Victoria Falls. Located between Zimbabwe and Zambia, a trip to Victoria Falls is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Africa. While it’s not peak season for a game viewing safari, this is the best time to visit Botswana if you’re looking to save a bit of cash.Botswana is actually one of the most expensive safari destinations, so traveling outside of peak season can be a major perk for your wallet. Best of all, you can see the incredible raw beauty of the Okavango Delta flooded (a bucket list item for any safari lover!).NamibiaThe wet season is ending in April and Namibia is once against bathed in sun. If you are ready for the ultimate road trip, add a drive across Namibia to your things to do in Africa list.South AfricaWelcome to autumn in South Africa! As cooler and drier weather comes, trees lose their leaves and it’s easy to spot the local wildlife. Local game reserves are a perfect destination.TanzaniaIn April, I would highly recommend checking out the northern parks of Tanzania. It is a top time to go on a safari and you will be able to avoid peak season, which runs from July to October.  MayJust as things are warming up in the Northern Hemisphere, there is a chill in the air south of the equator. When it comes to the best time to go on safari, this simply isn’t prime time for most of Africa—with one spectacular exception though!MozambiqueJust before the peak season, Mozambique is at its best. The afternoons get into the high 80s while the afternoons rarely fall below 50 degrees. The skies are clearing up as the rainy season ends. Hotspots like Gorognosa and Niassa are prime for exploration.Read More:The Best Time to Travel to Mozambique   Namibia JuneJune is the turning point of the year in Africa. Goodbye, rain. Hello, sunshine! June is one of the best times of year to go on safari in Africa in so many diverse spots around the continent.South AfricaIn South Africa, you’ll find two distinctly different seasons in June. In the northern part of the country, things are drying out. It’s peak game viewing time up there and the days are sunny. In the south, near Cape Town, however, it’s the absolute rainiest time of the year.While it’s not great for a safari, it is the best time of year to see the whale migration in the Southern Cape. Explore the delta as herds head to Chobe and then make their way over to Linyanti.NamibiaThe weather is dry and relatively warm. As the natural sources of water are diminished by the arid season, it is easy to spot animals hanging out together at local water sources. Be sure to plan ample time to explore Etosha National Park.ZimbabweThe peak season here is from June to September. During June, the landscape is drying out. You know by now that dry weather means animals partying at the local watering hole! June is also a dream month to visit Victoria Falls (and I’d highly recommend flying over to see the falls while they’re at their most powerful of the year).  OKAVANGO RIVER CRUISEJulyDry season is in full swing and you will be spoilt for choice all around the continent. This is peak travel time and easily the best time of year for a safari in the majority of the best spots in Africa.It’s nearly impossible to choose the best place to go in July—but you better hurry!This is the most popular time of year and things sell out fast. Of course, that means that trips come at a premium so your options for a budget safari are pretty limited.TanzaniaSerengeti National Park is a massive draw during July. The Great Migration in northern Serengeti will truly blow your mind. Elephants are migrating in Tarangire while spots like Katavi, Selous, and Ruaha offer something a bit more off the beaten path.South AfricaMore of the same from June, the weather in the north of South Africa is getting even drier and spotting wildlife is getting even easier. Meanwhile, the Cape is still rained out but with perfect whale spotting conditions.BotswanaJuly is definitely one of the best times of year to visit Botswana. Famous areas like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and Linyanti are flawless. The Delta is gloriously flooded and animal spotting is as likely as ever. Just note that animals have mostly left the Pans and Kalahari area.KenyaThe Great Migration is running its way through Maasai Mara during July and August. We are talking wildebeest and zebra galore! It is an amazing time but definitely busy. Take your time and do some research while picking a camp so you don’t end up anywhere too crowded when safari madness sweeps the world.  Kenya Ultimate GuideAugustAnother unbeatable time of year for an African safari! The weather is still dry for a bit longer and ideal across the continent in many spots.KenyaYou haven’t missed the Great Migration yet so get to Maasai Mara to see a draw-dropping movement of wildebeests and zebras. Be sure to spend at least part of your safari at the river where you can see these guys zigzagging between crocodiles as they make their way across the river.TanzaniaYou can also check out dramatic river crossing in Tanzania, especially in Lamai and Kogatende. Iconic spots like the Serengeti National Park are at their best as the elephant migration takes over the country (around in Tarangire). While tourism is at its peak, you can still check to find tranquil spots around Selous, Ruaha, and Katavi.BotswanaIf you want to see majestic elephants, look no further.The Chobe and Linyanti area has more of these massive cuties than anywhere else on the continent. The Okavango Delta is still flooded as well and looks incredible at this time of year. Just note that the Pans and the Kalahari are largely empty at this time of year as the local wildlife vacations abroad.ZimbabweAlso in its peak season, Zimbabwe is at the top of its game for safaris. Adventure lovers will want to make sure to hop over to Victoria Falls after the game spotting for more heart-stopping fun. The water is a bit lower at this time of year and it’s white water rafting season.NamibiaFor more unforgettable animal sightings, get to Etosha then make your way out to the Skeleton Coast to soak in the otherworldly beauty. Just LOOK at my latest pics and you won’t be able to wait another minute to see this epic country.  KenyaSeptemberGo big or go home in September! During the heart of the dry season, you are going to see the biggest of big game animals at top spots around the continent.TanzaniaDuring the Great Migration, Tanzania is at its peak with constant river crossings and elephants thundering through. Of course, the Serengeti National Park is an essential destination. For river crossings, the northern part of the park around Lamai and Kogatende is the place to be. To get up close and personal with the majestic elephants of Tanzania, be sure to plan time for Tarangire National Park.BotswanaSeptember is the best time to visit Botswana. Famous spots like Okavango, Moremi, Chobe, and the Linyanti are truly at their very best. Chobe and Linyanti is the elephant capital of Africa for the time. Meanwhile, the Okavango Delta is flooded and sparkling with beauty. While the whole country is beautiful, steer clear of the Pans and Kalahari areas, which many of the animals have left behind for the season.ZimbabweDry season is upon Zimbabwe and the conditions in the country couldn’t be better. After most of the tourists have gone home, all of the animals are gathering at their watering holes, and the country is ripe for exploration.NamibiaGet to Etosha peaks for unbeatable game viewing then make your way over to the Skeleton Coast for some of the most gorgeous scenery in all of Africa.MozambiqueTourists are clearing out as summer comes to an end (but the weather is still gorgeous!) in Mozambique. If you are looking to squeeze in a beach break during your African safari, look no further than this coastal retreat.KenyaOf course, it’s all about the Great Migration in Maasai Mara. This is one of the best times to visit Kenya. When you want to get away from the tourist hotspots, check out the quieter regions of the north. Game viewing is equally impressive up there but you’ll be a bit more off the beaten path.OctoberThe dry season is coming to an end in October but you can still find prime conditions across the country before the rain really starts to roll in.ZimbabweThe bush is still quite dry around Zimbabwe so animals are chilling around the most popular water sources. While the weather is still quite hot, it’s bearable. Be sure to plan time for Ruaha and Katavi where the tourists have cleared out and big game have taken their place. In the north, the Tarangire area is filled with elephants while the Serengeti is seeing many river crossings.KenyaPrices are lower than usual while the game is still active and visible. If you are looking for a budget safari option that will knock your hiking boots off, this one’s for you.TanzaniaStill in its peak season, it is warm but not crazy hot in Tanzania. To escape the heat of places like Zimbabwe, wildlife is coming to the permanent watering hole they know and love in Tanzania.  MEERKAT SAFARI IN BOTSWANANovemberThe southern side of Africa is into the rainy season. Humidity and heat (don’t forget it’s summer down here!) make it pretty uncomfortable in a lot of places. There is a minor East African migration for serious safari-goers in Liuwa Plain National Park but, otherwise, many of the popular spots are a washout.TanzaniaIf you stick to the northern part, you will see migrating herds making their way across the country despite the weather.BotswanaWhile it is not your traditional African safari fare, the skies above Botswana are alive with action. Birds are migrating through the Okavango Delta while dramatic storms sweep in for stunning photo ops.Although the weather is hot, it is at least a dry heat with the exception of passing storms. Since it’s not peak season, you can grab a major deal on when camps are offering up to 40 percent off their peak rates.DecemberWant to decorate the yuletide bush and ring in the new year under the stars? East Africa is the best place to be for a winter break in Africa. Across the regions of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, the weather is dry and the animals are active.KenyaThe rainy season in Kenya is coming to an end in the middle of December. The scenery is lush and emerald but that makes it a bit tougher to spot game. It’s still worth it though! The Maasai Mara, Laikipia, and Lewa areas are drop-dead gorgeous at the end of the year.TanzaniaThe Serengeti and Ngorongoro area beautiful at this time of year but across the country rainfall will be making it a bit harder to spot game. Stick to the Northern Circuit to see the locals celebrating Christmas in their own way.OverallSo, my fellow explorers, that is all you need to create your perfect safari. I know there are a TON of options. Every month offers something a bit different.The bottom line is: just go! Africa, as a whole, is certainly one of the most underrated travel destinations on the planet. My best advice is to simply find a place that intrigues you and go for it.For me, the most dynamic and interesting countries in Africa for a safari are Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and, of course, my adopted home of South Africa.Note, while there are other places I could have included on this list, I mainly stuck to the ones with my opinion of “best experiences.”But I’d love to hear your opinions and what places you would suggest during certain times of the year below!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-cottars-1920s-safari-camp-in-kenya/,Staying at Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp in Kenya,Tanzania,"Since moving to South Africa, I’ve fallen in love with safaris. When it comes to safaris in Kenya, it’s all about the Cottar family. These guys are known as the “first family” of the safari business. In fact, it’s been almost 100 years since the family started its safari company, and it has earned ample bragging rights since then.The Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp has 2 accommodation options, the luxurious Bush Villa and beautiful, unique tents, within the 1920s-themed camp. I love old-time charm and another African safari was on my list, so I was invited to check out the camp for a few nights.Here’s my experience at Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp!Getting to Cottar’s 1920s Safari CampThe easiest way to get to the Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp in Kenya is by the Cottar’s private airstrip, which is just a ten-minute drive from the camp. Two airlines, Fly 540 and East African Safari Air Express, fly here twice a day during the low season and three times a day during the high season.You’ll also find a range of airlines that fly into Keekorok airstrip, which is a one-and-a-half-hour drive from the Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp.The HistoryOne of the trademarks of Cottar’s Camp is its proximity to the Maasai community, a famous local tribe that is seen by many as the embodiment of traditional Kenyan culture. While they’ve been well exposed to modern life, the people of the Maasai tribe have remained true to their traditional way of life. Visiting the local Maasai village was definitely one of the highlights of my visit to Kenya.I spent four days with a Maasai guide who told us tales of his childhood growing up in the bush.He shared so many of the beautiful lessons that the Maasai pass down through generations. On the morning of our departure, he took us to visit the village where he grew up. Children approached us in curiosity, smiling as they saw their likeness in the LCD displays of our cameras. We were welcomed into their humble homes and shown a much simpler way of life, which they hold dear.It was a profound experience that I will never forget.The Safari CampThe Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp is set on 6,000 acres of gorgeous landscape. There are two main tents there dedicated to eating, drinking, and being merry. They are the places to connect with other travelers or just unwind with a good book.Far from roughing it, this luxe camp has a swimming pool and spa area that will keep you feeling pampered throughout your glamping experience.I stayed in the Bush Villa, which is essentially a private, luxury home within the camp.It has a breathtaking view over the savannah and the Olderikesi Hills. Guests of the villa have a staff of 8 at their service, and can enjoy privately guided game drives, night game drives, bush walks, swimming and fishing. The villa was seriously impressive and overwhelming (in a good way!). It is over 10,000 square feet in size, and features a large living room, dining room, a magnificent viewing deck, and 5 en-suite bedrooms, all with stunning views.In addition to the villa, there are ten tents in the camp– a deluxe honeymoon tent, five double tents, and four family suites. They all have en suite bathrooms and feel ultra-private.In my opinion, this would be a great option for larger families or groups that want to travel together. The family tents hold 2 ensuite bedrooms with a shared veranda, a dining room and a living room with fireplaces! I loved that the entire camp is situated in a way that the tents are private and quiet, whether for the honeymooners or families with children.While it’s a good place to disconnect, you don’t actually have to unplug. There is Wi-Fi in the camp, and you’ll find a good phone signal in many spots. There’s also a cell phone available in the office that you can use anytime if you’re having trouble getting connected.ConservationIt’s not just about tourism for the Cottars. The family has set up the Cottars Wildlife Conservation Trust to help preserve local wildlife habitats while protecting animals from poachers. The money that you spend at the safari camp helps to support the Cottar’s 6,000-acre Olderikesi Wildlife Conservancy that is a refuge for threaten Kenyan animals.Activities & SafarisLocated just under one mile from the Maasai Mara game reserve, this is the perfect spot to take in the incredible nature and culture of the region.The Cottar’s 1920s Safari Camp organizes day and evening drives to the Masai Mara game reserve so that you can see the animals in their natural habitat. There are also guided bush walks, river swimming, and fishing excursions as well as cultural visits with the local Maasai people.More InformationHotel: Cottar’s 1920s Safari CampLocation: Maasai Mara National Reserve, KenyaAccommodation: Luxury, SafariPrice Range: $$$Thank you to Cottar’s Camp for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-pack-for-an-african-safari/,What to Pack for an African Safari,Tanzania,"Updated: October 2019An African safari was one of my biggest bucket list experiences and, I’ll be honest, at first, I was confronted with a completely new packing dilemma — what should I pack for a safari?I had done an elephant safari in Sri Lanka and spent a couple of days at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa, but since then, I’ve explored many game reserves throughout the top safari destinations in Africa, including Namibia, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, and have refined my safari packing list.When you’re staying in and exploring the bush, my best advice is to choose comfort above all things. But, comfortable doesn’t have to mean frumpy. A cute safari style is easily achieved with comfortable layers that will keep you warm on early morning game drives and cool during hot afternoons back at your accommodation.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for your own safari trip!My African Safari Trip DetailsLocation: KenyaTravel Dates: Late-MarchSeason: Beginning of Wet SeasonWeather: We had beautiful weather around Maasai Mara in late-March. However, March to May marks the wet season across much of Kenya.In the peak of the rainy season most other parks, especially in the highlands and the coastal parks, can be problematic with regards to heat, humidity, and continuous rain. June through October and January-February are typically high season and offer the best weather.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African SafariWhat to Expect on an African SafariDepending on the destination you’re traveling to, most game drives are in the early morning (around 5 or 6am) returning around 11am and in the evening (around 4pm) returning just after sunset.Helpful Tip: “Safaris” are typically referred to as “game drives” around Africa.Morning Game Drive: It is typically quite cold on the early morning game drives, so you’ll want to wear lots of layers and remove them as the morning sun gets warmer.When staying at Mahali Mzuri and Cottar’s Camp in Kenya, they provided hot water bags on our early morning game drives to help keep us warm as well!After exploring for a few hours, your guides might set up a bush breakfast or coffee and tea for you to enjoy before heading back. You’ll typically return to your accommodation before the heat of the day really sets in.Evening Game Drive: Your evening game drive starts when the warm sun is still up, but expect the temperature to drop quickly — especially at sunset. Most evening game drives involve a couple of hours of exploring and end with sundowners (evening drinks at sunset) and snacks before heading back.You’ll definitely want to have layers for your evening drive as it can get pretty chilly with the wind.Read More: Top Things to Look for When Choosing a Safari LodgeHow to Choose an African Safari (That’s Right for You)Luggage Requirements and Baggage AllowanceTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance if you have to take a bush flight. When traveling from Nairobi to the Maasai Mara, my flight with Safari Link had some pretty strict requirements.Unfortunately, they only allowed 15 kgs / 33 lbs inclusive of hand luggage. That meant all of my camera gear and camera bag (zoom lenses, cameras, etc.), my purse, toiletries, and clothes all had to weigh less than what I’d normally pack in a carry-on.I ended up having to leave behind a ton of clothes and even my tripod. It was a HUGE bummer but they are very strict with their policies. Fortunately, they offered free luggage storage. But, if you are connecting in multiple airports and not returning to your original airport, you’ll need to take everything with you.You also might not be allowed to use a hard suitcase if they require “soft” suitcases. That means you’ll need to use a soft bag, like a duffel bag.I always travel with this wheeled duffel bag that collapses easily!My advice, again, is to triple check your airline luggage requirements, pack LIGHT and use a soft duffel bag.What to Pack for an African SafariKeep in mind neutral, earth tones for your safari wardrobe! Dark colors will attract heat, and make sure to avoid blue or black clothing as they attract tsetse flies (if you’re in an area with them). !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Not only will it keep you warm on the sunrise and sunset game drives, but it can also be used to keep the dust out of your face.3. Sunglasses // Protect your eyes, and keep some dust out of them while you’re at it.4. Socks & Underwear // Trust me on this, bring a LOT of socks and undies. You get pretty dirty while on the game drives and you’ll want to keep changing to feel fresh.Helpful Tip: You’ll also want to bring along gloves for warmth and earplugs for the nighttime noises. *cue hippo snoring*5. ONA Camera Bag // I typically travel with the ONA Camps Bay backpack, since it can fit all of my gear, however, since I had to pack lighter for the safari, a bag like the ONA Prince Street Messenger was an awesome choice. It’s made of high quality, sturdy materials, and it can fit all of my camera gear, my drone, and my laptop. !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

https://theblondeabroad.com/ultimate-guide-to-gorilla-trekking-in-uganda/,The Ultimate Guide to Gorilla Trekking in Uganda,Uganda,"Going gorilla trekking has been on my Africa bucket list forever. There’s something so humbling about being so close to these beautiful animals and sharing that space in nature with them.Bwindi National Park in Uganda does an excellent job of preserving the natural environment and the wellbeing of the gorillas. During my most recent stay at the Sanctuary Retreats Gorilla Forest Camp, I got to check it off my list, and my goodness was it a dream come true!After a 2.5 hour trek into the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, we met the Mubare gorilla family. I couldn’t have asked for a more incredible encounter. We spent an hour with them, watching the little ones play and explore their surroundings.The family is led by the largest silverback in the entire forest and, let me tell you, he was HUGE.If you’re interested in going gorilla trekking for yourself, here’s everything you need to know from when to go, permit info, what to pack, and what to expect!The Best  Time to GoDue to its climate and location near the equator, Uganda is truly a year-round destination. However, there is a drier season which is ideal for trekkers. The rainy seasons run from October to November and mid-March to May. With the rain, you can still see the gorillas, but you’ll likely be more comfortable when the weather is drier.This means the best time to go gorilla trekking in Uganda is June through September and January or February. Because of this, Uganda can be quite busy during these months, especially December.This means higher rates for both accommodations and for the trekking permits.If budget is the main concern, visiting from March to May or October and November will help you save some cash. And don’t fret about the monkeys. The national parks are still in full operation and the animals are still wandering about.  How to Get Permits and VisasWe stayed at Sanctuary Retreat Gorilla Forest Camp (which I would highly recommend) and they took care of arranging the permits and everything needed for gorilla trekking for us, which was amazing!However, if you choose to stay somewhere that does not provide a permit, I highly recommend booking through a tour company.You can choose to get a permit yourself—which is around $700. Or, you can book a safari tour (which includes the permit) which will average anywhere from $1,100 to $6,000 (the price truly varies depending on what kind of experience you’re after), but include most or all of the things you would need to get/hire anyway (guide, porter, gear).Regardless of how you choose to go trekking, you will also need a visa to get into Uganda.You can get one online here. You’ll just need a valid passport that can maintain its validity for at least 6 months after your arrival in Uganda. You’ll also need a vaccination certification that proves that you’ve been vaccinated for yellow fever. Lastly, you’ll need a passport-size photo of yourself.Read More:Important Things to Look for in a Tour CompanyWhat  to ExpectThis was my experience gorilla trekking in Uganda—booked through the place we stayed: Sanctuary Retreat Gorilla Forest Camp.It wasn’t as early in the morning as I thought it would be. We left the property around 7:30 am, and at the ranger station, we had an orientation for about an hour to get us all prepped. Everyone sits facing a stage-like area, and they had local kids and musicians providing some brief entertainment while we waited for everyone to arrive.The particular gorilla trekking center we were at has 5 gorilla families. What does this mean?It means that of the people who participated in the orientation, they’ll be split up into groups to go see one of those 5 families. From my observation, they split the groups up based on physical ability, so we were put with the group that walked the farthest and they ask you the night before how would you rate your physical ability.They’re able to accommodate anyone and everyone—even if you can’t walk, you can go gorilla trekking.The trackers and the porters are really incredible people, and you can literally be carried along the track if need be. It’s important to note that you have to organize this ahead of time and pay extra, but I thought it was really cool that they had this level of accessibility available.All of the gorilla families are located at different distances from the starting point, so if you are unable to track long distances, they will put you with a family that is closer.We were put with the family that was the farthest and we got the full experience of being out in the jungle. We were gone most of the day and I really appreciated getting to go on a long hike to see the family (and I have the blisters to prove it!).It took about 2 ½ hours to get there…definitely an arduous journey!Trackers go out hours before you do to make sure they can locate the gorillas and then they’ll stay with them well after you’ve left—basically until the last bit of daylight, so they have a good idea of where they might be the next morning.Gorillas sleep during the evenings, so the trackers can usually find them relatively easily in the morning. They sort of always know where they are and it makes it a lot easier to trek if you know where they are!Basically, your chances of seeing the gorillas are really, really high.   Hiring a PorterYour group consists of 8 guests and you have the option to hire a porter. I highly recommend doing this!Hiring a porter doesn’t mean you are weak or unable to carry your own things. It gives a local a job for the day—so many people in this part of Uganda are dependent on income from tourism that we are providing. It’s only $15 minimum for the day, we paid our guide $30, and we each hired a porter, both me and my boyfriend, Meyer.They were very helpful whether they were carrying our things or not. They’ll help you get up when the mud is slippery or if there’s a challenging area.And in my opinion, hiring a porter makes the overall experience much more pleasant.Each guest can hire a porter, which can bring the group up to 16 people and then you will have your guide and two guards (one at the front of the group and one at the back). Yes, there are armed guards, but they are there for your safety.There are some dangerous animals in the forest—not ones you might consider dangerous, but specifically elephants. If they’re spooked or they don’t see you coming, they can charge and can become a serious danger, so the guards are mostly there in case they need to fire a warning shot into the air. This brings the group up to 19, which is pretty much the max size.Observing the GorillasOnce you’ve gone through the jungle and you get to the gorilla family, all of the porters stay behind and only your group of 8 with the two guards and the guide will approach the gorillas. So it’s a very small group of people.Talk about an intimate experience!Before you go to see the gorillas, you’ll get one final briefing from your guide and then he will run over all the do’s and don’ts.You have one hour with the gorillas.Why this specific time period? The gorillas have been habituated, which basically means they have been conditioned to understanding that humans are part of their natural environment. Habituation takes a few months to a few years to start to understand that humans are not a threat.Because the park is so heavily regulated, nobody is allowed to go into the forest without a ranger; there aren’t risks of poaching, so it is okay for these animals to be habituated because humans are not a threat in the Bwindi National Impenetrable Forest.They’ve come to recognize and expect humans to come and approach them for one hour of the day, every day. This one hour is specific for both the benefit of the gorillas and our own safety. If they expect humans to come for one hour a day—this is normal for them, if you were to stay longer than an hour, this can be distressing for them.That is why there is a strict one-hour regulation.Believe me, it is plenty of time to observe the gorillas and you’re allowed to move about, just consult with your guide to ask about where you’d like to stand or where you’d like to go is okay, safe, and won’t be distressing for the gorillas. You’re advised to keep a distance of about 7 meters (~20 feet).   I highly recommend getting as many photos as you want when you get there and then just putting your camera down and observing them without your lens.Sit down, watch them.We were getting mixed reviews about whether or not you should look them in the eyes, but our guide encouraged us to do so.It’s an incredibly humbling experience when you lock eyes with a silverback gorilla.Our particular family was the first gorilla family to be habituated in Bwindi and they have the largest silverback in the forest, and let me tell you…this guy was massive! He was about 5x the size of an average male human.Holy smokes!Necessary VaccinesTo visit Uganda, it is recommended that you are vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, typhoid, tetanus, yellow fever, meningitis, cholera, rabies, polio, MMR, chickenpox/shingles, pneumonia, influenza, and tdap.Most of these are common vaccines that you’ve likely already received, but always triple check just to be safe!What Photography Gear to BringMost people told me that you get so close that you wouldn’t need to bring a zoom lens for your camera, however, I’m really glad I packed mine.I definitely didn’t need my tripod. The only reason I could see you wanting or needing a tripod is if you’re traveling solo or if you’re into night photography. It rained most nights (all night long), so we didn’t really see the stars. And this is pretty normal, given the super tropical weather.I shot on my Fujifilm X-T3 camera. I brought my 35mm prime lens (great for portraits and details) which I really enjoyed having for walking around the community walk in Bwindi (read more about that here!).The other lens I predominantly shot on was the Fujinon XF 50-140mm Telephoto Zoom F2.8 R LM OIS WR Lens.I would suggest bringing a prime lens for every day and a kit zoom lens if you’re close enough (something like a 16-55 2.8 could work). HOWEVER, we were at a distance where I pretty much kept my 50-140mm 2.8 lens on the whole time, even for video, because it has optical image stabilization.This allowed me to get really lovely portrait shots with the bokeh because of the fixed 2.8 aperture. It is quite a big lens, but worth it.Read More:The Beginner’s Guide to Photographing in Manual ModeMy Travel Photography Gear (Perfect for Female Travelers!)   What to Pack for Gorilla TrekkingYou can pack really light!

https://theblondeabroad.com/10-local-foods-to-try-in-vietnam/,10 Local Foods to Try in Vietnam,Vietnam,"Vietnamese cuisine uses fresh ingredients and not a whole lot of oil or dairy, making it one of the healthier cuisines around the world — common ingredients include fish sauce, soy sauce, rice, noodles, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables, and different proteins.In fact, to me, it’s the perfect balance of fresh and light food that doesn’t weigh you down too much, yet it’s still filling.If you’ve ever had phở (pronounced like fuh), you know it’s the kind of soup that can put you back together.

Here are 10 local foods to try in Vietnam!Goi CuonMany people are familiar with the fried spring rolls but gỏi cuốn is the lighter and healthier alternative.The fresh spring rolls consist of thin vermicelli noodles, pork, shrimp, lettuce, and mint, all tightly wrapped in translucent rice papers. Because of their mild flavor, they’re usually dipped in a peanut or fish sauce.Yum!Cao LauWhen exploring the ancient towns of Vietnam, trying cao lầu is a must. This Hội An noodle dish is topped with pork, crunchy rice crackers, spices, and a handful of fresh herbs and lettuce.A little bit of broth rests at the bottom of the bowl; both the texture and color of the dish set it apart from other Vietnamese noodle dishes.Bún Bò XàoBún bò xào is a noodle salad—in Vietnam, it’s considered a light meal rather than an appetizer.Served in layers, the dish consists of rice noodles, vegetables, beef that has been marinated in lemongrass, roasted peanuts, crispy fried shallots, and lots of fresh herbs such as cilantro, lemon, basil, and mint.Com TamCom tam, also known as broken rice, is traditionally served with a fried egg, grilled pork, prawns, or beef, and both fresh and pickled vegetables.It’s a popular dish for breakfast or lunch and is an extremely inexpensive option. Street markets and food stalls sell it for VND 20,000. That’s less than $1 USD!   Bánh MìBánh mì is a popular French-Vietnamese sandwich that’s great for a quick fix on the go.It’s served on a baguette, which though it might look like the French bread, has a much sweeter flavor! The bread that serves as the foundation for the sandwich was introduced to Vietnam in the middle of the 19th-century when Vietnam was part of French Indochina.Between the baguette sits pickled vegetables, pate, butter, soy sauce, cilantro, chilies, and hot peppers. You’ll find lots of variation when it comes to this sandwich…but my goodness, are they all divine!PhoPhở is arguably the most popular Vietnamese dish in the world.There are two main options: chicken (Phở Ga) and beef (Phở Bo). Aside from the meat, a typical bowl of phở contains rice noodles (for which the dish is actually named after), bean sprouts, lime wedges, cilantro, basil, mint, and sliced onion.If you like your broth a bit more flavorful, you can add chili sauce and jalapenos to give it a bit more of a kick…however I’ve found the places that have really good broth don’t need anything else added.Bún ChaOriginating from Hanoi, this noodle dish is by far one of the most popular in the capital city!Small patties of seasoned pork and pork belly are grilled over charcoal. The dish is served with a variety of sauces so you can pick and choose.The meat is then served with herbs, a plate of vermicelli noodles, and chả giò (deep-fried rice paper rolls).Bánh XèoBánh Xèo is a savory crepe made from rice flour and turmeric powder, which is then stuffed with pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts.Many choose to wrap it in lettuce and dip it in fish sauce to give it a bit more of tanginess.Bún Bò HueSometimes referred to as bún bò, this sweet and spicy soup is perfect for a cold day!Beef broth is prepared with lemongrass, shrimp paste, sugar, and chili oil and is then added to a bowl of rice noodles, a variety of meats, lime, and herbs. It’s the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy, all in one dish.Bò KhoPronounced “baw-khaw,” this dish is the Vietnamese version of the French boeuf bourguignon.Comprised of beef shank and tendon that is stewed in lemongrass and five-spice flavored broth, you typically dip a piece of bánh mì bread into the sauce before feasting on the meat and veggies. You can also get it as a noodle-based dish—this is known as mì bò kho.   Bonus: Vietnamese Coffee + BreakfastVietnamese coffee is quite different than what you would expect from a typical cup of Western coffee.It’s especially sweet as it’s typically served with sweetened condensed milk—because of this, fresh milk, sugar, or cream are not necessary.A typical Vietnamese breakfast will likely consist of noodles (phở) or sticky rice (xoi). In Saigon, if you’re craving eggs, you can order com tam. In some areas, you might find bánh bao—a Vietnamese bun similar to dim sum—which is a great “grab-and-go” breakfast.Quick Guide to Ordering for VegetariansIf you’re in Vietnam and you want to tell someone that you’re vegetarian, you can say “toi an chay.”To avoid meat, you can say “khong thit,” but that doesn’t mean a dish will be strictly vegan. Though there won’t be any meat, there will still likely be fish sauce or a meat-based broth. These can be especially hard to avoid at street markets.Tofu is a very common protein in Vietnamese cuisine too, so that will be an option most places!You can order Phở Chay for a “vegetarian, tofu phở,” but only more tourist locations will use a vegetable broth rather than a meat broth.Heads up: You can order Báhn Mì with “no meat,” but they will still put the pâté—which is a meat paste.OverallThere are honestly so many delicious Vietnamese dishes to try…it was difficult to narrow down this list!

https://theblondeabroad.com/cruising-bai-tu-long-bay-with-dragon-legend-cruise/,Cruising Bai Tu Long Bay on Dragon Legend,Vietnam,"This post was written by Lauren, one of our Travel Expert Contributors!There’s no better way to see the stunning islands of Bai Tu Long Bay than on a cruise. Far off the beaten path of the typical tourist traps of Southeast Asia, these Vietnamese landscapes are indescribably beautiful.Making my way through its fishing villages, caves, and dramatic shorelines, I explored this corner of Vietnam with a local, luxury cruise.Here’s my experience cruising Bai Tu Long Bay on Dragon Legend Cruise.Cruising Bai Tu Long BayWhile some cruises feel touristy and disconnected from the local culture, the Dragon Legend Cruise was the total opposite. Less traveled than the main Ha Long Bay, the Bai Tu Long Bay took us into places we would have never seen on our own.We opted for the 3 days, 2 nights cruise!At the start of our adventure, they picked us up from the Hanoi Old Quarter in a luxury van and took us over to Hon Gai Harbor. The first order of business was kayaking through the breathtaking Karst Mountains then making our way back to the ship to spend the night at Bai Tu Long Bay.The next morning, we arrived at the Vung Vieng fishing village and explored by row boat before heading over to the Thien Canh Son cave system. That night, the Dragon Legend Cruise wound back through the Karst Mountains and onward to the Dong Trieu province to visit a traditional Vietnamese agricultural village.Dragon Legend Luxury BoatsLuxurious yet featuring a totally distinct Vietnamese style, each Dragon Legend boat has four decks with both inside and outside restaurants, a spa, fitness center, bar, and sundeck area.While this intimate ship is dwarfed by the oversized liners of the Mediterranean and Caribbean, it has everything that you need for a comfortable stay.The SuitesEach Dragon Legend boat features 24 luxury cabins. While the pics looked nice online, I was blown away by how impressive they were in person. With handmade art from different regions of Vietnam, these oversized rooms are full of luxe touches.The bathrooms are perfect for long, vacation night baths. Fill them up, grab a drink, and watch the world pass by the window while you soak.ActivitiesIt’s impossible to be bored on a Dragon Legend Cruise. They have a range of options available so you can just pick and choose what you like to create your own pace.You can start the day with Tai Chi or just relax with a cup of coffee on the deck while you take in the view. One of the unforgettable aspects of the trip for us was the daily kayaking excursions. We explored the amazing bay and surrounding caves for some extraordinary sights.Another thing we loved was learning about the local culture at Vung Vieng fishing village and a local pearl farm. As the final adventure, we got to watch a renowned water puppet show, which is a Vietnamese tradition.Helpful Tip: Be sure to bring a waterproof camera for kayaking! The views are truly once-in-a-lifetime and you’ll definitely want to snap some shots.The Food & DrinkIt’s authentic Vietnamese cuisine all day, every day- need I say more? The food was ultra fresh and they offer a good variety. Always important, the Dragon Legend Cruise is good at accommodating dietary restrictions so just let them know what you need and they’ll make sure you’re well fed.On day two, we had a great beach BBQ with fresh seafood, veggie treats, and other classic grilled dishes.About Dragon LegendThe Dragon Legend Cruise is part of the famous Indochina Junk company. These guys are seriously dedicated to conservation and eco-travel, which has become more and more important as the bay sees more tourism.Indochina Junk works with locals to preserve the environment and educates their guests throughout the cruise.While we were out in our kayaks, they encouraged us to pick up any trash that we saw. We loved it, and it was cool to see a company that was going above and beyond to keep Vietnam gorgeous."
https://theblondeabroad.com/the-best-time-to-go-to-vietnam/,The Best Time to Travel to Vietnam,Vietnam,"You can find my 10 Day Vietnam Itinerary HERE!One of the safest and cheapest destinations in Southeast Asia, Vietnam is an incredible year-round destination. Whether you are traveling solo or with friends, this is definitely a place that you won’t want to miss.Narrowing down the best time to go to Vietnam is a bit tricky. The country is 1,025 miles long, and while that might not seem huge, it’s incredibly diverse, and the weather varies a lot from place to place.Here’s what you need to know about the seasons and the best time to go to Vietnam! Vietnam in the WinterMonths: December to FebruaryVietnam can get incredibly hot, so winter is a good time to travel if you prefer more temperate weather. Vietnamese New Year, Tết, is the biggest celebration of the year, and this is one of the best times to visit.The dry season in the northwest starts in October and goes through March. This period is the best time to visit. It does get cold in the mountains though, so bring a warm jacket. In Sapa, it’s not unusual to see snow in December and January.The weather is also dry in Hanoi and the wider North Vietnam region.You’ll see temps ranging from sixty-two to seventy-one degrees Fahrenheit. Generally speaking, anytime between October and March is comfortable for trekking around and seeing the sights.In Central Vietnam, the monsoon season ends in December. While the temps dip to into the sixties, you’ll see afternoon highs pushing the eighties by February. In the south, the wet season ends in early November, and you’ll find similarly warm weather there too.If you are looking for a tropical beach escape, winter is a great time to visit Phu Quoc. Just pack a bikini, and you’re set!Helpful Tip: Central Vietnam is home to the world’s largest cave, Son Doong, and you won’t want to miss it. The weather down there is always more extreme, so you’ll want to pack warm clothes for a winter visit. Vietnam in the SpringMonths: March to AprilMarch and April weather is warm and dry in the north, which means it’s still a great time to visit. In Hanoi and around Ha Long Bay, you’ll find temps in the sixties with high humidity and the occasional drizzle. Farther south, you’ll see steamy weather between seventy and ninety degrees.While you will usually have gorgeous sunny skies, you’ll still want to plan for rain. A lot of locals wear thin plastic ponchos, which can be a good solution. If you wear anything too thick, you’ll overheat, so opt for ultra-lightweight materials.Helpful  Tip: While the weather will start heating up in the spring, locals stay pretty covered up. Be sure to bring a few outfits that cover your shoulders and legs. Think maxi dresses and thin scarves. While you can wear whatever you want to the beach, it’s good to have something more modest to wear around town and in temples. Vietnam in the SummerMonths: May to SeptemberWhile the farthest corners of the north can still be chilly, most of Vietnam is hot all summer long. If you are looking to travel all of Vietnam, you’ll find the most consistently nice weather from May to June. The middle of the country is hot and dry while the southern and northern parts are in the midst of the rainy seasons.If this is your first monsoon season, get ready for some serious rain.The skies open up for incredible downpours. On days pushing one hundred degrees, this can be a massive relief. It can also mean long-term rain. It just comes down to luck really, and you should have some backup activities in mind.Summer is Vietnam’s most popular season. If you are traveling around the coast, expect the highest prices of the year (though it’s still super cheap), and book your accommodation well in advance to beat the rush. Vietnam in the AutumnMonths: October to NovemberNot too hot, not too rainy; you’ll love fall in Vietnam. If you are going to Hanoi, October and November are the best times of the year. You’ll find dry days averaging around seventy degrees, which is perfect for sightseeing. Throughout the rest of the country, you’ll find pretty dry weather and temps in the mid to upper sixties.One of the best things about fall in Vietnam is the Mid-Autumn Festival.This incredible festival is unlike anything you’ve ever seen with lanterns lighting up the night sky and lion dancers taking to the streets. This is the perfect time to chow down on some mooncakes and learn about life in Vietnam."
https://theblondeabroad.com/important-safety-tips-women-traveling-vietnam/,Important Safety Tips for Women Traveling in Vietnam,Vietnam,"Vietnam is a country where tourism is blossoming, and the established backpacker trail of Southeast Asia is now drawing more affluent visitors and solo travelers.One of the most attractive features of Vietnam as a destination is that although it is a relatively inexpensive country to explore, it is also one of the safest destinations in Southeast Asia.However, there are specific factors to consider when looking at your safety if you are a woman traveling in Vietnam, and taking a few precautions can undoubtedly help to ensure your safety.Here are some safety tips for women traveling in Vietnam!Women and ClothingWhen it comes to the attitudes of the Vietnamese towards women traveling solo, one aspect worth considering is that Vietnam is still quite a conservative country.Many women have reported that Vietnamese men will ask them curiously about why they are traveling solo, and why they aren’t married. For this reason, some women choose to wear a dummy wedding ring as a decoy to avoid such questions being asked.Clothing can also affect the way that men act towards women in Vietnam. The best option is to follow the style of the local women and to cover up when you are heading into the town or city center.Some women who do go out wearing skimpy tops and skirts have reported some examples of being propositioned, although there are very few serious crimes that do take place in the country.Avoiding Theft and Petty CrimeOne of the most common issues that people find in Vietnam is that petty crime such as pickpocketing and theft of items such as cameras, laptops, and rucksacks can happen. Good common sense can help to reduce the chances of this happening, and trying to avoid making yourself a target is very wise advice.Keep any valuables hidden in a bag which you keep close to yourself at all times, and particularly avoid carrying a camera or sunglasses on a strap around your neck in populated areas.One method of theft is from the back of a motorbike, so makes sure you keep a hand on any bags, as these can easily be grabbed from a moving bike.Political Sensitivities and PhotographyAlthough Vietnam is a country that has opened up significantly over recent years, like many countries, there is still a security presence around many military and transport hubs.Try to avoid taking photographs in areas where police or military individuals are present and be aware that, in some cases, they may ask you to delete photos or even ask you to hand over your memory card. Be respectful and use your best judgment when taking photos.Scams and BeggingThere are many ways in which some unscrupulous retailers, taxi drivers and other service providers can try to catch out visitors to the country, and using unofficial inflated exchange rates is a common trick.Also, try and research the tour company you are going to use if you are planning a trip around some of the major sights, as some people have reported having tours that are very different to the advertised itinerary. Begging is quite common, mainly in tourist areas, but most beggars will leave you alone if you say no.Behavior and Cultural ConsiderationsMany of the people in Vietnam live modest lives, so try to be considerate and avoid displaying excessive wealth or expensive clothing and jewelry in areas where it is not common.Like anywhere else, displaying wealth will not only attract petty criminals but may also trigger some feelings of resentment from local people. One important thing to avoid is drugs and, while they may be available, the punishments can be severe.Looking After Money and DocumentationLosing cash and your passport and visa can be an issue for travelers so, when possible, make sure that you use the safe in the hotel and carry a photocopy of your documents.One good tip is to use a money belt that can be worn inside clothing while using an inside pocket that cannot be reached without opening a jacket can also be a smart move.Also, try not to keep everything in one place as losing your money, wallet and documentation in one go is something we all want to avoid while traveling."

Book your stay on a junk boat cruise and sail through limestone islands that reach for the heavens.North VietnamIn the north of the country, the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi is a beautiful city for great shopping and eating. It’s also a great hub between Ha Long Bay and northern towns such as Sapa.If you’re interested in having clothes made, the best city to go to is the coastal city of Hoi An. The ancient town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and reflects a well-preserved port town from the 15th to 19th centuries.South VietnamIf you are heading to South Vietnam, the beautiful bay of Ke Ga has gorgeous beaches and the stylish Princess d’Annam Resort & Spa is a great place to truly unwind.And definitely don’t miss the hustle and bustle of Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City), the largest city in Vietnam.

With a female guide, you’ll explore the Vietnamese highlands by motorbike, stay with local families and learn to cook traditional meals.The chance to enjoy some ‘Quan ho‘ singing is also one of the best ways to get a taste of the local culture.  It is sung by a quartet of singers, with two girls singing the first line, before being responded to by two male singers.This is particularly common during Tet, which is the Vietnamese New Year. Watching this performance on the gondolas of Hoan Kiem Lake is a great way to enjoy this cultural event.Seeing a water puppet show is another cultural experience worth enjoying, where the puppets are held above water and manipulated by long poles beneath the water, which are operated by experienced puppeteers. These puppets are beautifully painted, and the art form is recognized as a key part of the country’s heritage. Whatever your travel style, Vietnam has something for every solo female traveler! "
https://theblondeabroad.com/magical-sapa-vietnam/,"3-Day Homestay Tour in Sapa, Vietnam",Vietnam,"While traveling solo in Southeast Asia, I created an itinerary for Vietnam that included some of the best things to see and do in the country. I only had about 2 weeks to explore on my own, but was determined to experience a homestay tour in Sapa.Sapa has become a popular tourism destination for travelers around the world who come to trek trails between and around the highland villages of the Hmong, Zao, Ta Van, Lao Chai and Y Linh Ho people.The little mountain town sits in the North of Vietnam. Mist fills the sky and lush green rice fields spread for miles in all directions. You honestly won’t be surprised if a unicorn and rainbow appears in the distance.I arrived via night train from Hanoi in the town of Lao Cai where I took a bus about an hour up into the mountains to Sapa.Led by a woman named Hong, here’s my experience doing a 3-day homestay tour in Sapa, Vietnam!My train ticket from Hanoi to Lao CaiMy bus to Sapa – complete with bovine roadblocks– Day 1 in Sapa –Hong picked me up directly from my bus transfer and took me to a little hotel where I would spend my first night. We didn’t waste any time. I showered, dropped off some clothes to be laundered, and then Hong and I hit the road on her motorbike!But, not before a long line at the gas station…Our first stop was down the mountain to a little village called Ta Phin where the local Red Zao people live. The women wear traditional clothing and are distinguished by their red scarf headpieces.Hong had arranged for me to visit a family and their home.My awesome guide, HongThe woman, her husband, and her three children shared their home with five other women. The Zao are known for their extremely intricate embroidered handiwork.They showed me their little craft area and I bought one of their traditional headscarves from them after they fully dressed me in one of their own outfits.Passing Red Zao childrenThey couldn’t believe how tall I was!A little Red Zao girlAfter leaving Ta Phin, we rode for almost an hour up the mountain to see a few of the amazing waterfalls in Sapa. We made it up to a huge waterfall surging over the cliff of one side of a mountain called Silver Waterfall.We trekked up until we reached a bridge that splits it at the middle. It was so beautiful! After hanging out in the splash zone for a while, we got back on the road.We drove another 20 minutes up the mountain to Heaven Gate where you could see a trench in the mountains that seemed to go on forever until it vanished in the distant haze. Another few minutes down the mountain and we reached another waterfall, Love Waterfall.We trekked about 2 km to reach it.The waterfall came down over the edge of a mossy stone edge of the mountain and into an ice cold pool. I took my shoes off and let the cold water run over my feet while I gazed up at nature’s incredible creation.Hong dropped me back off at my hotel once we got back to town and I spent the evening walking around the cute little streets. Sapa town has a lot of French influence and the buildings are all brightly painted with European style balconies and clay tiled rooftops.There is even a beautiful lake in the center if town where there are flower beds, cute little lampposts and park benches, and even swan boats available for rent. It almost felt like I was in a romantic little European mountain town.– Day 2 in Sapa –Hong picked me up at 9:30 am to get our day started early. We were staying with a local family that night after visiting a few other villages throughout the day.I had noodles and coffee for breakfast- a typical Vietnamese breakfast!We first stopped at the local market to shop for food to prepare lunch and dinner at our home stay. Then we were off for two days of trekking and adventure! We drove by motorbike to Ta Van village and trekked through the Lao Chai and Y Linh Ho villages where the Hmong people live.Testing my motorbike skills on the open road.The Hmong people dress in all black and use indigo to dye the fabric they make by hand. In many homes there were big vats of the indigo concoction and big wooden looms.Indigo BarrelsThey also are pretty resourceful in building machines to peel the grain of rice from its little shell. It’s a sort if teeter totter thing and when one side fills with water running from the stream and then gets heavy and empties, the other side comes smashing down into a tub of rice.We visited the school in each little village and made lunch with a Zay family in Ta Van. They were making rice wine in a giant barrel when we arrived.If I had time two stay two months I would’ve been able to taste it!As I helped make lunch with the family, the kids were definitely intrigued by me being there. They shyly watched me and giggled as I chopped vegetables and helped prepare the meal over the open fire.After eating, we drove all the way to Ban Ho village at the base of the mountain. Hong arranged a home stay with a family that lived in a beautiful old wooden home. The entire area around Ban Ho was absolutely stunning.Rice fields in shades of yellow and green covered the earth as far as the eye could see.After some exploring around the village, and we arrived back at our family home, we started the long process of preparing dinner. Hong arranged for us to have vegetable spring rolls with homemade sweet chili sauce, steamed rice, veggie soup, steamed pumpkin, and fried river fish.After a full day of adventure, and a HUGE meal, we called it an early night in anticipation for our last day of the tour in the morning.– Day 3 in Sapa –This morning, we started our day off with (you guessed it) noodles! On our way back to Sapa we stopped for one final trek in Giang Ta Chai Village. We walked about 2 miles over a river to the other side of the mountain which I hadn’t been to yet.We also ran into a bunch of insects, critters and animals!Stumbling upon a red dragonfly…… and a pig with some puppies… and even a cow cooling off in a bath… and we aren’t even gonna talk about THIS creature from my nightmaresWe got back to Sapa Town around 11 am where I bid farewell to Hong. It was in unforgettable few days in Sapa full of adventure and cultural experiences. If you ever, and I highly advise you do, come to Sapa you absolutely 100% need to have Hong show you around.– About My Guide, Hong –While being guided around Sapa by Hong, she informed me that she was the first woman in Sapa to start her own tours and has been helping her other female friends by teaching them English and how to give guided tours.You go girl!She also informed me of the difficulties of life here in Vietnam. Women do most of the work in Sapa and a lot of husbands are known to be drunks and abusive.She said her husband is an exception and that he does work, but it’s difficult for him to give tours because he doesn’t know English.Her two children live with their grandmother because she has to work so much. Her oldest daughter has just started school and it costs 4,000,000 dong (almost $200) each year to send her to school.College is a whole different animal but something incredibly valued in their society. While it was sad to hear, she was dedicated to working hard to create a better life for herself and for her children.It was an honor to have such an amazing woman as my guide! Want to get Hong’s contact info and possibly stay with her? I’ll send you her info in an e-mail!Inquire Now NOTE: Hong is an individual and not an official tour company, so you might find some of the systems aren’t how you would traditionally handle things. Unfortunately, I don’t work for her and she is just an individual so you’ll have to trust in whatever system she gives you. It’s been many many years since I went to visit her and my intention was to share my experience on who I went with and her contact details. However, in the years that have followed, there have been a number of TBA readers that have stayed with her and had a wonderful experience.Reader Updates:Aline A., February 8, 2015 – “Hi Kiersten, Thank you for the information. I did a tour in Sapa with her and she was amazing, always smiling and joking, giving a lot of information about the life in Vietnam… (but the weather was really bad). She has two daughters now, divorced from her previous husband and is now married with a man from Holland. They seem really happy together. She opened a café few weeks ago and does the tour guide just for people like me who heard about her. Here’s a picture of her. Have a nice day, Aline”Natasa B., May 26, 2015 – “Hey Kiersten! I had to write you and thank you so much for Hong’s contact information. She was nothing short of amazing. Our experience was also unforgettable 🙂 She’s doing great and thanks to you she has had more people come through and never needs any form of advertising. She has remarried in the last 2 years and looks like she is in a perfect place. Thanks again so much for sharing 🙂 Best of luck on all your travels and I will keep following your adventures for advice in case I go there as well.”Georgia C., May 23, 2015 – “Hey Kiersten! I just wanted to let you know that I did take the tour with Hong, and it was definitely the highlight of my trip. I had two new friends with me that I met while travelling and we all had an amazing time. I had a really good talk with Hong about her childhood and how she managed to build an amazing tour business and cafe even when her life circumstances were not ideal. She and her new Dutch husband, whose name is Art, took us out for a BBQ dinner under a tarpaulin cover in the rain. We got the chance to ask some questions about Vietnamese life and culture from both a Vietnamese perspective and from the perspective of a foreigner living in Vietnam. That was especially helpful for me hearing those things while I begin living in Hanoi. Thanks again for sharing her information Kiersten, it was a truly unforgettable experience. From Georgia”Stephanie V., May 30, 2015 – “Just wanted to let you know we ended up spending 3 days and 2 nights with Hong as our guide. You were right, she’s absolutely fantastic. We loved getting to spend time with her and her husband (he was equally as great). They have a little café now that served as our base and a great place to hang out and chat with them. At the moment only her 8-year-old is living with them, but in a couple of days her 6-year-old will permanently be moving in and Hong is so happy to have the family together. She is so strong and hard working… and hilarious. Thanks again for her info and the recommendation.”"
https://theblondeabroad.com/ha-long-bay-junk-boat-cruise/,Ha Long Bay Junk Boat Cruise,Vietnam,"Ha Long Bay is a majestic sort of place made up of almost 2,000 limestone islands.It was about a 4-hour drive on a bus from Hanoi, Vietnam, but I met a lovely girl named Grace, from Melbourne, so the time went quickly. We even ended up getting our own rooms on the boat which was awesome!The Junk Boats are these beautiful old wooden ships that really look more like a pirate ship than anything I could put into words.We had lunch as soon as we boarded… a full spread of fish, chicken, tofu, rice, etc. Our first day was full of activities! Our first stop was at a little floating village where a small group of people have lived for many generations.Each house has it’s own fish farm and is self sustained so nobody ever leaves.Even the little children take boats to their small one room floating school! We got to visit one of the little floating huts and they had caught oysters, crabs, prawns and all sorts of other fish.We then took a smaller Vietnamese “speed boat” to an area of islands referred to as “The Valley.” It felt like I was in Jurassic Park or Avatar as we floated past dozens of gigantic, ancient, limestone islands.We had to go through a natural cavelike tunnel to reach this incredible lagoon in the center of one of the islands.After our island tour complete with flamboyant tour guide, we went back to our Junk Boat and sailed further until we reached the Sung Sot Grotto or “Amazing Grotto.”I had no idea that these incredible caverns existed!The one we visited is a World Heritage area and rightfully so… it was absolutely incredible! The caverns were cold and lit by soft lighting to showcase their beauty. When you came out the other side of the grotto you had a view from the top of the cliffside overlooking the whole bay.After the grotto, we had even more in store for us. Grace and I took out a kayak for about an hour and explored the little caves and wonders around the surrounding islands.We explored the limestone caverns and “parked” our kayaks to take in the view looking out onto the bay.Dinner was served just before sunset and, after such a long day, we rested and enjoyed the view of the bay lit up by the fellow Junk Boats.We had our final thrill of the day by jumping off the second story of the boat into the ocean below!At 9:30 pm we were given fishing poles to test our luck at squid fishing. It just so happens I’m a natural! I caught two in a row, while nobody else was able to catch any other squid!According to our super tour guide, catching a squid just before the new moon brings a month of good luck. We were up early the following morning for a hazy sunrise and a noodle breakfast and coffee.…when in Vietnam!I took advantage of my last few hours onboard soaked up the sun on the roof deck and read until the boat got to shore. The view was still as magical as when I first boarded. I wasn’t ready to leave!We docked around noon and I bought some beautiful pearl earrings from street merchants. Lunch was arranged WAY too early but we did get free beer! It seemed like we tried to stuff twice as many people on our bus for the ride back to Hanoi as we had on the way to Halong Bay.When we got back to Hanoi we were each dropped off at our respective hotels and I bid farewell to my new friend Grace. She will be moving to LA in January, so I’m excited to join forces in the big city!I had an overnight train scheduled to take me up to Sapa at 9:40 pm so I had lots of time to kill. I was able to leave my bag at the hotel I had stayed at the night before last while I strolled the evening streets of the Old Quarter.I was so exhausted, hadn’t showered, and all my clothes were dirty, yet I had to board a ten hour train to Sapa. I caught a taxi to the station and boarded the train around 9:30 pm. More InformationLocation: Ha Long BayCompany: There are over 500 licensed junk boats in Ha Long Bay and tours typically begin and end in Hanoi. Shop for a tour company in Hanoi. Be sure to ask the right questions, and ask other travelers instead of travel agents to ensure you go with the right tour.Price Range: $-$$$$Helpful Tip: Your experience is likely to be similar no matter what tour you choose- whether it’s budget, midrange or luxury. But, the price you end up paying is a good indicator to the quality of the experience you’ll have. If a more luxurious Ha Long Bay experience interests you, check out the Dragon Legend boat on Bai Tu Long Bay!"
https://theblondeabroad.com/blonde-moment-upon-arriving-in-vietnam/,"A Bowl of Phở, a Blonde Moment and my Vietnam Itinerary",Vietnam,"I slept through my entire night bus ride from Phnom Penh, Cambodia and was woken up around 6 am when we stopped at the Vietnamese border.I had previously given my passport to a courier in Cambodia to get my Vietnamese visa. This was the second time in 24 hours that I handed my passport to a complete stranger.We all filed through the passport check ,we had our passports returned to us and I got my Vietnam entry stamp. It was another 2 hours or so to Saigon, which I also slept through, and when we arrived I had time to kill before my flight to Hanoi…or so I thought.The crazy streets of Vietnam!I decided to wander around town a bit (luggage in hand) and happened upon an alley that looked like a backpackers area. A lovely Vietnamese woman who owned a hostel offered me a seat to join her for coffee. I ordered an iced coffee and she gave me a map and told me where to grab some cheap Phở.She even let me leave my bag at the hostel while I explored the area a bit. I grabbed Phở at the place she recommended for 12,000 Vietnamese đồng (less than $.50)!I can’t even express how excited I was for a big steaming bowl of the spicy and delicious noodle soup.Phở: The elixir of lifeHere’s where I pull, yet another, blonde moment in my journey. I thought my flight was at 3 pm when in fact it was at 1:25 pm. So I am basically just wasting time walking around markets and price comparing local SIM cards when I realize my mistake.I sprint back to the hostel at noon and figure there is NO WAY I’m making my flight.The owner of the hostel I left my luggage at helps me flag a cab and the driver steps on it! Normally the drive takes 45 minutes and we got there in 15.Guess that extra đồng I offered him helped!Stackin’ up the currenciesI made it in plenty of time, grabbed a new SIM card for local Vietnamese calls and some chocolate (so necessary) and headed to my gate. On the plane a little 12-year-old Vietnamese girl named Lucy sat next to me. She told me all about her handsome American English teacher at school and we pointed out shapes of animals in the clouds from the airplane window.Her grandfather even invited me to stay with their family in Hanoi but I had planned to catch the night train tonight for Sapa. The Vietnamese people have been so friendly and helpful. I am so thankful! Once I collected my baggage, I went to exchange some more money for đồng and went to a travel kiosk to organize my travels in Vietnam.Based on recommendations, I didn’t book anything until arrival at the airport.After about an hour of planning with a really helpful travel agent, I organized the following Vietnam itinerary:August 18th: Stay at Serenity Hotel in Hanoi in the Old Quarter29th: Get picked up 8 am for an overnight Ha Long Bay Junk Boat Cruise30th: Back to hotel around 4 pm, night train to Sapa 8 pm31st: Picked up by private guide in Sapa, tour on moto, home staySeptember 1st: Tour Sapa and home stay2nd: Tour Sapa, night train back to Hanoi 7 pm3rd: Fly from Hanoi to Da Nang 10 am, stay at hotel in Hoi An4th: Hoi An activities TBD5th: Hoi An activities TBD6th: Fly from Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh 12:40 pm, stay one night7th: Fly from Ho Chi Minh to Denpasar, Bali 9 am I booked everything from the trains, to the tours, to the flights. A first for me to plan an entire visit to a country in one swoop! But, according to all the advice I received about visiting Vietnam, unless you’re motorbiking through Vietnam, plan ahead!Now it’s time for some fun! I got to the hotel and the room is great. It is so nice to finally have a comfortable bed after two night buses in a row. I took my first shower in two days and I am so tired I feel like I’ll either start crying at any moment or faint! I grabbed some dinner down the street and am going to sleep."
https://theblondeabroad.com/microlight-flight-over-victoria-falls/,Microlight Flight Over Victoria Falls,Zambia,"Victoria Falls had been one of my dream destinations for years. When I finally got there to see the falls in person, it absolutely took my breath away.One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, Victoria Falls is the largest waterfall in the world and a truly magical place.While the falls are beautiful from any angle, there is nothing that can compare to seeing it from above. For a view that you will never forget, a microlight flight is a must.Here’s what you should know about taking a microlight flight over Victoria Falls!My Experience Flying Over Victoria FallsOn my epic girls’ trip to Zambia, I took a microlight flight that definitely got my heart racing, but also gave me some incredible vistas.I did a 15-minute flight, which was quick but ended up being plenty of time to see it all. We went back and forth over Victoria Falls and I even got a chance to see African wildlife in their natural habitat.Preparing for a trip to Victoria Falls? You’re definitely going to want to check out my Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia.Options for Exploring the FallsI took a flight with Livingstone’s Adventure and it was a once in a lifetime experience. The flight I took was $179 USD per person at the time.Although that is pricey on a minute-by-minute basis, it is well worth it to have an experience like this. The view (and the heart-racing experience of being so high up over the falls) is something that is just unforgettable.While I loved my short and sweet microlight, there are a few other options worth checking out. You can do the 15-minute microlight in the morning or afternoon. If you would rather opt for a longer experience, you have the option of going for a 30-minute trip in either the morning or afternoon.Livingstone Adventure also has the option of ultralight flights, which will have you up in a slightly different aircraft. Ultimately, it is a very similar experience but in a slightly different aircraft (of course, the little details can make a difference in your comfort level if you’re afraid of heights, like yours truly).It is $179 USD for 15 minutes or $360 USD if you opt for a 30-minute flight in an ultralight aircraft.Other Activities Around Victoria FallsThe flights aren’t Livingstone Adventure’s only excursions. You can also go for a Zambezi River boat cruise or take a smaller boat out for a river safari.If you want a bit of everything, they have the Ultimate River Cruise option, which is a speedboat ride followed up with drinks on a luxe cruise. If you’re looking for another fun pick, they also have canoe trips down the river so you can check out the game, birds, and incredible scenery on a DIY boat trip.As far as on land options, you can ride quad bikes through the Livingstone and Batoka Gorge, or hop on the horse trail. There you can opt for a safari on horseback or in a romantic horse-drawn carriage through the Falls Resort Complex.One cool thing that Livingstone’s Adventure has is their ‘mix and match’ packages. If you want to do a few things, you will definitely want to check out the Ticket to Livingstone’s Adventure. They have got six different options where you can explore by land, sea, or air. For those looking to maximize every second at Victoria Falls, this is an option well worth considering.Helpful  TipIf this is your first time exploring the wild, check out my tips on how to choose an African safari that’s right for you. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-victoria-falls-from-zimbabwe-and-zambia/,Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia,Zambia,"Victoria Falls was a dream destination of mine for years. One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, it is the largest waterfall on the planet and even more beautiful than I’d ever imagined!While I visited in early 2017, we stayed at the Tongabezi Lodge and organized a visit through the lodge to see the falls from both sides—it was unforgettable. Ready to fall in love with one of Africa’s greatest sites?Here’s my guide to visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia. Getting to Victoria FallsThe best part about the location of Victoria Falls is that you can see it from both Zimbabwe and Zambia in one day! Start your day in either country and eventually make your way over to the other side.From Zimbabwe: The quickest way, and most common way, to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is to fly from Johannesburg, South Africa (JNB), to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe (VFA). The flight takes about two hours.From Zambia: The main entry point to the falls in Zambia is Livingstone Town. You can fly from Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, or Johannesburg to Livingstone Airport, also known as Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport (LVI). Once you are in Livingstone, it’s just six miles into the park.Taxis are only available on a seasonal basis, so be sure to plan before you go.Getting a Visa to Visit Victoria FallsCurrently, US citizens can get a visa on arrival at the airport in both Zimbabwe and Zambia, and you’ll want to purchase the KAZA UniVisa visa, which allows you to cross both borders and move between both sides of the falls. If you purchase this visa, you’ll not only save some money, you won’t have to wait in line to cross over to the other side of the falls.The KAZA UniVisa costs $50 USD, and you can cross the border as many times as you like, as long as you stay within Zambia and Zimbabwe.The visa prices and requirements vary quite a bit for other nationalities (and are always subject to change), so do your homework. You can check out the Zimbabwe and Zambia travel sites before you go to confirm what you’ll need.In the case that you cannot get the KAZA UniVisa on arrival, there are immigration offices conveniently located near the entrances to the falls so you can purchase a visa to the other country/side.Helpful  TipIf you have luggage with you, I would suggest grabbing a taxi, otherwise you can just walk!Victoria Falls From ZimbabweIf you’re flying into and staying in Zimbabwe there are a few options of how to see the falls from this side.Victoria Falls is a tourist hot spot, and it’s just over a mile from the entry into the park. And the area is way more than a photo op! You can go white-water rafting, hiking, or you can check out the local wildlife and so much more.You’ll want to plan on plenty of time to take it all in. Three-quarters of Victoria Falls lies within Zimbabwe, and there are so many amazing views.One of the best sights is from the truly breathtaking Devils Pool, where you can lounge on the edge of the world.Border CrossingOnce you’ve seen all the sights from Zimbabwe, make your way to the Victoria Falls bridge where you can walk across onto the Zambia side. Be sure you have cleared customs on the Zimbabwe side and keep your stamped ticket that will get you back into Zimbabwe when you’re done.Victoria Falls From ZambiaIf you flying into and staying in Zambia, follow these tips on seeing the falls from the Zambia side.I stayed on the Zambian side at Tongabezi Lodge and loved it. I also took a microlight flight over Victoria Falls, and it was one of the most amazing things I’ve done.Whatever you do on the Zambian side, you have to check out the Knife Edge Bridge for a breathtaking view of Victoria Falls, but be sure to bring your raincoat! The Knife Edge Bridge connects to Livingstone Island. Located in the heart of the Zambezi River, this gorgeous island leads right up to the 335-foot drop of thundering water from the falls.Border CrossingWhen you’re done taking in the falls from the Zambia side, head to the Victoria Falls Bridge where (with visa in hand) you can walk across into Zimbabwe!It’s a must-see!What to Bring to Victoria FallsWhen it comes to packing, think light. If you are going to be on small planes or taking a safari before or after the falls, your luggage space will be super limited. Hard-sided cases are often not allowed, and even a carry-on bag might be too much. Be sure to check the restrictions before you go.When packing, focus on the essentials. Here’s what you’ll want to grab before you go.Layers: It’s generally pretty warm at Victoria Falls. The winter here runs from May to September, and the average temperatures are in the sixties. In the summer, you can expect afternoons at eighty degrees or higher. Temperatures will regularly vary by twenty degrees or more in a single day, so you’ll want to pack layers.Sun Protection: The rays can be intense here! Pack sunglasses and a sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection. An oversize hat is also handy for your neck and face.Comfy Shoes: There is so much to see around Victoria Falls. Pack comfortable shoes, and plan on doing tons of walking.Waterproof Jacket: No surprises here! You can get seriously soaked at Victoria Falls, and waterproof gear is essential. I also advise against wearing anything jeans-like because it takes ages to dry. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-tongabezi-lodge-near-victoria-falls/,Staying at Tongabezi Lodge near Victoria Falls,Zambia,"I’ve stayed at a lot of amazing places around the planet but, every so often, I can still be swept off my feet—and this place did just that! Tongabezi Lodge is located in Zambia (near Victoria Falls) and is one of the most magical properties I’ve ever experienced.This place is straight out of a Mark Twain story; I fell asleep listening to hippos grunting in the distance and woke up in a tree house with monkeys playing outside the windows. We waited in stopped traffic as elephants crossed the street at sunset. And, we sat on our river raft and sipped our tea as we watched crocodiles cruise slowly down the river.Ready to for an otherworldly experience? Welcome to Tongabezi Lodge! Getting to Tongabezi LodgeStraddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Tongabezi Lodge is nestled on the Zambezi River. While the lodge is remote, there are a couple of easy travel options. You can fly into the new Victoria Falls International Airport which is just an hour’s drive from the lodge.Another option is flying into the Livingstone Airport in Zambia, which is the closest airport to Tongabezi. If you’re coming from South Africa, there are direct flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town. From the Livingstone Airport, Tongabezi is a only a 30 minute drive away!Tongabezi LodgeI planned my stay at Tongabezi as a girlfriend getaway with 3 of my best friends. The Tongabezi Lodge is made up of 6 private houses and 5 river cottages on the Zambezi River, including the Bird House, with its open-air bathtub and private terrace; the Tree House, set high above the river; a luxe honeymoon house; and the Nut House, with gorgeous art and textiles from all over Africa.We stayed at the Garden House for two nights and in the Dog House for one night.If you’re traveling with a group, the Dog House and Garden House are great picks that both sleep up to five people. Whichever accommodation you choose, you’ll get a private valet who will make sure that you have an incredible stay and, with the exception of the Garden House, each house and cottage is located right on the river.While I didn’t get a chance to check them out, the Tangala House (a private residence) and Sindabezi Island (a private island) also offer unique experiences— they are both on my agenda for the next visit!Food & DrinkAt Tongabezi Lodge, three open-air dining decks offer a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience. One night, we had dinner on a floating platform on the Zambezi River. The waiters delivered each delicious course by canoe!With a few of my besties gathered around a table under an expanse of stars, we spent a few charmed hours eating, drinking, and laughing as the lanterns burned through the black of night.With incredible local chefs using ingredients from the onsite, organic garden brimming with fruit, veggies, and herbs, the traditional Zambian cuisine is all about seasonal and local ingredients.Visiting Victoria FallsOf course, the biggest draw of the area is Victoria Falls. Tongabezi Lodge offers guided tours or you can book your own. I’d dreamed of visiting Victoria Falls for as long as I can remember, and it was even more incredible than I had imagined!We organized a visit with Tongabezi and saw the falls from both sides, Zambia and Zimbabwe.I took a microlight flight over Victoria Falls, and it was truly one of the coolest things I’ve done in my life. While the falls are stunning from the ground, there is nothing like taking it all in from above. Below you, you will not only see the falls, but countless wild animals too! I spotted elephants, crocodiles and hippos!It’s one adventure that you’ll definitely want to add to your bucket list!I highly recommend planning at least one full day at Victoria Falls. It’s open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From the Zambia side, you’ll pay $20 USD to get in; from the Zimbabwe side you’ll pay $30 USD.Helpful  TipBe sure to opt for a KAZA visa when entering immigration through either country. It’s only $50 USD and allows entry to both Zimbabwe and Zambia.Read More: Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and ZambiaActivitiesStaying at the Tongabezi Lodge on the Zambezi River is all-inclusive.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-pack-for-an-african-safari/,What to Pack for an African Safari,Zambia,"Updated: October 2019An African safari was one of my biggest bucket list experiences and, I’ll be honest, at first, I was confronted with a completely new packing dilemma — what should I pack for a safari?I had done an elephant safari in Sri Lanka and spent a couple of days at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa, but since then, I’ve explored many game reserves throughout the top safari destinations in Africa, including Namibia, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, and have refined my safari packing list.When you’re staying in and exploring the bush, my best advice is to choose comfort above all things. But, comfortable doesn’t have to mean frumpy. A cute safari style is easily achieved with comfortable layers that will keep you warm on early morning game drives and cool during hot afternoons back at your accommodation.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for your own safari trip!My African Safari Trip DetailsLocation: KenyaTravel Dates: Late-MarchSeason: Beginning of Wet SeasonWeather: We had beautiful weather around Maasai Mara in late-March. However, March to May marks the wet season across much of Kenya.In the peak of the rainy season most other parks, especially in the highlands and the coastal parks, can be problematic with regards to heat, humidity, and continuous rain. June through October and January-February are typically high season and offer the best weather.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African SafariWhat to Expect on an African SafariDepending on the destination you’re traveling to, most game drives are in the early morning (around 5 or 6am) returning around 11am and in the evening (around 4pm) returning just after sunset.Helpful Tip: “Safaris” are typically referred to as “game drives” around Africa.Morning Game Drive: It is typically quite cold on the early morning game drives, so you’ll want to wear lots of layers and remove them as the morning sun gets warmer.When staying at Mahali Mzuri and Cottar’s Camp in Kenya, they provided hot water bags on our early morning game drives to help keep us warm as well!After exploring for a few hours, your guides might set up a bush breakfast or coffee and tea for you to enjoy before heading back. You’ll typically return to your accommodation before the heat of the day really sets in.Evening Game Drive: Your evening game drive starts when the warm sun is still up, but expect the temperature to drop quickly — especially at sunset. Most evening game drives involve a couple of hours of exploring and end with sundowners (evening drinks at sunset) and snacks before heading back.You’ll definitely want to have layers for your evening drive as it can get pretty chilly with the wind.Read More: Top Things to Look for When Choosing a Safari LodgeHow to Choose an African Safari (That’s Right for You)Luggage Requirements and Baggage AllowanceTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance if you have to take a bush flight. When traveling from Nairobi to the Maasai Mara, my flight with Safari Link had some pretty strict requirements.Unfortunately, they only allowed 15 kgs / 33 lbs inclusive of hand luggage. That meant all of my camera gear and camera bag (zoom lenses, cameras, etc.), my purse, toiletries, and clothes all had to weigh less than what I’d normally pack in a carry-on.I ended up having to leave behind a ton of clothes and even my tripod. It was a HUGE bummer but they are very strict with their policies. Fortunately, they offered free luggage storage. But, if you are connecting in multiple airports and not returning to your original airport, you’ll need to take everything with you.You also might not be allowed to use a hard suitcase if they require “soft” suitcases. That means you’ll need to use a soft bag, like a duffel bag.I always travel with this wheeled duffel bag that collapses easily!My advice, again, is to triple check your airline luggage requirements, pack LIGHT and use a soft duffel bag.What to Pack for an African SafariKeep in mind neutral, earth tones for your safari wardrobe! Dark colors will attract heat, and make sure to avoid blue or black clothing as they attract tsetse flies (if you’re in an area with them). !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Sun Hat // You’ll definitely need a wide-brim hat to protect you from the rays. Pack 1 or 2 just to be safe, and make sure they aren’t thick material that will make you sweat!2. Light Scarf // I pack a scarf on every trip but you’ll want one on safaris. Not only will it keep you warm on the sunrise and sunset game drives, but it can also be used to keep the dust out of your face.3. Sunglasses // Protect your eyes, and keep some dust out of them while you’re at it.4. Socks & Underwear // Trust me on this, bring a LOT of socks and undies. You get pretty dirty while on the game drives and you’ll want to keep changing to feel fresh.Helpful Tip: You’ll also want to bring along gloves for warmth and earplugs for the nighttime noises. *cue hippo snoring*5. ONA Camera Bag // I typically travel with the ONA Camps Bay backpack, since it can fit all of my gear, however, since I had to pack lighter for the safari, a bag like the ONA Prince Street Messenger was an awesome choice. It’s made of high quality, sturdy materials, and it can fit all of my camera gear, my drone, and my laptop. !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

https://theblondeabroad.com/microlight-flight-over-victoria-falls/,Microlight Flight Over Victoria Falls,Zimbabwe,"Victoria Falls had been one of my dream destinations for years. When I finally got there to see the falls in person, it absolutely took my breath away.One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, Victoria Falls is the largest waterfall in the world and a truly magical place.While the falls are beautiful from any angle, there is nothing that can compare to seeing it from above. For a view that you will never forget, a microlight flight is a must.Here’s what you should know about taking a microlight flight over Victoria Falls!My Experience Flying Over Victoria FallsOn my epic girls’ trip to Zambia, I took a microlight flight that definitely got my heart racing, but also gave me some incredible vistas.I did a 15-minute flight, which was quick but ended up being plenty of time to see it all. We went back and forth over Victoria Falls and I even got a chance to see African wildlife in their natural habitat.Preparing for a trip to Victoria Falls? You’re definitely going to want to check out my Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia.Options for Exploring the FallsI took a flight with Livingstone’s Adventure and it was a once in a lifetime experience. The flight I took was $179 USD per person at the time.Although that is pricey on a minute-by-minute basis, it is well worth it to have an experience like this. The view (and the heart-racing experience of being so high up over the falls) is something that is just unforgettable.While I loved my short and sweet microlight, there are a few other options worth checking out. You can do the 15-minute microlight in the morning or afternoon. If you would rather opt for a longer experience, you have the option of going for a 30-minute trip in either the morning or afternoon.Livingstone Adventure also has the option of ultralight flights, which will have you up in a slightly different aircraft. Ultimately, it is a very similar experience but in a slightly different aircraft (of course, the little details can make a difference in your comfort level if you’re afraid of heights, like yours truly).It is $179 USD for 15 minutes or $360 USD if you opt for a 30-minute flight in an ultralight aircraft.Other Activities Around Victoria FallsThe flights aren’t Livingstone Adventure’s only excursions. You can also go for a Zambezi River boat cruise or take a smaller boat out for a river safari.If you want a bit of everything, they have the Ultimate River Cruise option, which is a speedboat ride followed up with drinks on a luxe cruise. If you’re looking for another fun pick, they also have canoe trips down the river so you can check out the game, birds, and incredible scenery on a DIY boat trip.As far as on land options, you can ride quad bikes through the Livingstone and Batoka Gorge, or hop on the horse trail. There you can opt for a safari on horseback or in a romantic horse-drawn carriage through the Falls Resort Complex.One cool thing that Livingstone’s Adventure has is their ‘mix and match’ packages. If you want to do a few things, you will definitely want to check out the Ticket to Livingstone’s Adventure. They have got six different options where you can explore by land, sea, or air. For those looking to maximize every second at Victoria Falls, this is an option well worth considering.Helpful  TipIf this is your first time exploring the wild, check out my tips on how to choose an African safari that’s right for you. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/visiting-victoria-falls-from-zimbabwe-and-zambia/,Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia,Zimbabwe,"Victoria Falls was a dream destination of mine for years. One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, it is the largest waterfall on the planet and even more beautiful than I’d ever imagined!While I visited in early 2017, we stayed at the Tongabezi Lodge and organized a visit through the lodge to see the falls from both sides—it was unforgettable. Ready to fall in love with one of Africa’s greatest sites?Here’s my guide to visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and Zambia. Getting to Victoria FallsThe best part about the location of Victoria Falls is that you can see it from both Zimbabwe and Zambia in one day! Start your day in either country and eventually make your way over to the other side.From Zimbabwe: The quickest way, and most common way, to Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe is to fly from Johannesburg, South Africa (JNB), to Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe (VFA). The flight takes about two hours.From Zambia: The main entry point to the falls in Zambia is Livingstone Town. You can fly from Zambia’s capital, Lusaka, or Johannesburg to Livingstone Airport, also known as Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport (LVI). Once you are in Livingstone, it’s just six miles into the park.Taxis are only available on a seasonal basis, so be sure to plan before you go.Getting a Visa to Visit Victoria FallsCurrently, US citizens can get a visa on arrival at the airport in both Zimbabwe and Zambia, and you’ll want to purchase the KAZA UniVisa visa, which allows you to cross both borders and move between both sides of the falls. If you purchase this visa, you’ll not only save some money, you won’t have to wait in line to cross over to the other side of the falls.The KAZA UniVisa costs $50 USD, and you can cross the border as many times as you like, as long as you stay within Zambia and Zimbabwe.The visa prices and requirements vary quite a bit for other nationalities (and are always subject to change), so do your homework. You can check out the Zimbabwe and Zambia travel sites before you go to confirm what you’ll need.In the case that you cannot get the KAZA UniVisa on arrival, there are immigration offices conveniently located near the entrances to the falls so you can purchase a visa to the other country/side.Helpful  TipIf you have luggage with you, I would suggest grabbing a taxi, otherwise you can just walk!Victoria Falls From ZimbabweIf you’re flying into and staying in Zimbabwe there are a few options of how to see the falls from this side.Victoria Falls is a tourist hot spot, and it’s just over a mile from the entry into the park. And the area is way more than a photo op! You can go white-water rafting, hiking, or you can check out the local wildlife and so much more.You’ll want to plan on plenty of time to take it all in. Three-quarters of Victoria Falls lies within Zimbabwe, and there are so many amazing views.One of the best sights is from the truly breathtaking Devils Pool, where you can lounge on the edge of the world.Border CrossingOnce you’ve seen all the sights from Zimbabwe, make your way to the Victoria Falls bridge where you can walk across onto the Zambia side. Be sure you have cleared customs on the Zimbabwe side and keep your stamped ticket that will get you back into Zimbabwe when you’re done.Victoria Falls From ZambiaIf you flying into and staying in Zambia, follow these tips on seeing the falls from the Zambia side.I stayed on the Zambian side at Tongabezi Lodge and loved it. I also took a microlight flight over Victoria Falls, and it was one of the most amazing things I’ve done.Whatever you do on the Zambian side, you have to check out the Knife Edge Bridge for a breathtaking view of Victoria Falls, but be sure to bring your raincoat! The Knife Edge Bridge connects to Livingstone Island. Located in the heart of the Zambezi River, this gorgeous island leads right up to the 335-foot drop of thundering water from the falls.Border CrossingWhen you’re done taking in the falls from the Zambia side, head to the Victoria Falls Bridge where (with visa in hand) you can walk across into Zimbabwe!It’s a must-see!What to Bring to Victoria FallsWhen it comes to packing, think light. If you are going to be on small planes or taking a safari before or after the falls, your luggage space will be super limited. Hard-sided cases are often not allowed, and even a carry-on bag might be too much. Be sure to check the restrictions before you go.When packing, focus on the essentials. Here’s what you’ll want to grab before you go.Layers: It’s generally pretty warm at Victoria Falls. The winter here runs from May to September, and the average temperatures are in the sixties. In the summer, you can expect afternoons at eighty degrees or higher. Temperatures will regularly vary by twenty degrees or more in a single day, so you’ll want to pack layers.Sun Protection: The rays can be intense here! Pack sunglasses and a sunscreen with UVA and UVB protection. An oversize hat is also handy for your neck and face.Comfy Shoes: There is so much to see around Victoria Falls. Pack comfortable shoes, and plan on doing tons of walking.Waterproof Jacket: No surprises here! You can get seriously soaked at Victoria Falls, and waterproof gear is essential. I also advise against wearing anything jeans-like because it takes ages to dry. "
https://theblondeabroad.com/staying-at-tongabezi-lodge-near-victoria-falls/,Staying at Tongabezi Lodge near Victoria Falls,Zimbabwe,"I’ve stayed at a lot of amazing places around the planet but, every so often, I can still be swept off my feet—and this place did just that! Tongabezi Lodge is located in Zambia (near Victoria Falls) and is one of the most magical properties I’ve ever experienced.This place is straight out of a Mark Twain story; I fell asleep listening to hippos grunting in the distance and woke up in a tree house with monkeys playing outside the windows. We waited in stopped traffic as elephants crossed the street at sunset. And, we sat on our river raft and sipped our tea as we watched crocodiles cruise slowly down the river.Ready to for an otherworldly experience? Welcome to Tongabezi Lodge! Getting to Tongabezi LodgeStraddling the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, the Tongabezi Lodge is nestled on the Zambezi River. While the lodge is remote, there are a couple of easy travel options. You can fly into the new Victoria Falls International Airport which is just an hour’s drive from the lodge.Another option is flying into the Livingstone Airport in Zambia, which is the closest airport to Tongabezi. If you’re coming from South Africa, there are direct flights from Johannesburg and Cape Town. From the Livingstone Airport, Tongabezi is a only a 30 minute drive away!Tongabezi LodgeI planned my stay at Tongabezi as a girlfriend getaway with 3 of my best friends. The Tongabezi Lodge is made up of 6 private houses and 5 river cottages on the Zambezi River, including the Bird House, with its open-air bathtub and private terrace; the Tree House, set high above the river; a luxe honeymoon house; and the Nut House, with gorgeous art and textiles from all over Africa.We stayed at the Garden House for two nights and in the Dog House for one night.If you’re traveling with a group, the Dog House and Garden House are great picks that both sleep up to five people. Whichever accommodation you choose, you’ll get a private valet who will make sure that you have an incredible stay and, with the exception of the Garden House, each house and cottage is located right on the river.While I didn’t get a chance to check them out, the Tangala House (a private residence) and Sindabezi Island (a private island) also offer unique experiences— they are both on my agenda for the next visit!Food & DrinkAt Tongabezi Lodge, three open-air dining decks offer a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience. One night, we had dinner on a floating platform on the Zambezi River. The waiters delivered each delicious course by canoe!With a few of my besties gathered around a table under an expanse of stars, we spent a few charmed hours eating, drinking, and laughing as the lanterns burned through the black of night.With incredible local chefs using ingredients from the onsite, organic garden brimming with fruit, veggies, and herbs, the traditional Zambian cuisine is all about seasonal and local ingredients.Visiting Victoria FallsOf course, the biggest draw of the area is Victoria Falls. Tongabezi Lodge offers guided tours or you can book your own. I’d dreamed of visiting Victoria Falls for as long as I can remember, and it was even more incredible than I had imagined!We organized a visit with Tongabezi and saw the falls from both sides, Zambia and Zimbabwe.I took a microlight flight over Victoria Falls, and it was truly one of the coolest things I’ve done in my life. While the falls are stunning from the ground, there is nothing like taking it all in from above. Below you, you will not only see the falls, but countless wild animals too! I spotted elephants, crocodiles and hippos!It’s one adventure that you’ll definitely want to add to your bucket list!I highly recommend planning at least one full day at Victoria Falls. It’s open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From the Zambia side, you’ll pay $20 USD to get in; from the Zimbabwe side you’ll pay $30 USD.Helpful  TipBe sure to opt for a KAZA visa when entering immigration through either country. It’s only $50 USD and allows entry to both Zimbabwe and Zambia.Read More: Guide to Visiting Victoria Falls from Zimbabwe and ZambiaActivitiesStaying at the Tongabezi Lodge on the Zambezi River is all-inclusive. On top of having all of your food and drinks covered, you’ll find tons of complimentary activities; game drives, bush walks, and boating trips are all included in the price at the Tongabezi Lodge.You can also indulge in a variety of amazing noninclusive activities in the area that are well worth it.Of course, Victoria Falls is way more than just a place to take selfies. You can go white-water rafting, swimming in the Devil’s Pool, bungee jumping, hiking, and canoeing. Cultural tours, cruises, and pretty much any other adventure you can imagine are available.Everyone on the Tongabezi team is great at organizing excursions, so just tell the staff what you’re into and you’ll be set! More InformationHotel: Tongabezi LodgeLocation: Zambezi River, ZambiaAccommodation: Luxury, SafariPrice Range: $$$ WATCH my video from Victoria Falls! Thanks to Tongabezi Lodge for hosting me during my stay.

https://theblondeabroad.com/what-to-pack-for-an-african-safari/,What to Pack for an African Safari,Zimbabwe,"Updated: October 2019An African safari was one of my biggest bucket list experiences and, I’ll be honest, at first, I was confronted with a completely new packing dilemma — what should I pack for a safari?I had done an elephant safari in Sri Lanka and spent a couple of days at Gondwana Game Reserve in South Africa, but since then, I’ve explored many game reserves throughout the top safari destinations in Africa, including Namibia, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, and have refined my safari packing list.When you’re staying in and exploring the bush, my best advice is to choose comfort above all things. But, comfortable doesn’t have to mean frumpy. A cute safari style is easily achieved with comfortable layers that will keep you warm on early morning game drives and cool during hot afternoons back at your accommodation.Use my packing ideas below, but revise as needed based on weather and season for your own safari trip!My African Safari Trip DetailsLocation: KenyaTravel Dates: Late-MarchSeason: Beginning of Wet SeasonWeather: We had beautiful weather around Maasai Mara in late-March. However, March to May marks the wet season across much of Kenya.In the peak of the rainy season most other parks, especially in the highlands and the coastal parks, can be problematic with regards to heat, humidity, and continuous rain. June through October and January-February are typically high season and offer the best weather.Read More: The Ultimate Guide to Going on an African SafariWhat to Expect on an African SafariDepending on the destination you’re traveling to, most game drives are in the early morning (around 5 or 6am) returning around 11am and in the evening (around 4pm) returning just after sunset.Helpful Tip: “Safaris” are typically referred to as “game drives” around Africa.Morning Game Drive: It is typically quite cold on the early morning game drives, so you’ll want to wear lots of layers and remove them as the morning sun gets warmer.When staying at Mahali Mzuri and Cottar’s Camp in Kenya, they provided hot water bags on our early morning game drives to help keep us warm as well!After exploring for a few hours, your guides might set up a bush breakfast or coffee and tea for you to enjoy before heading back. You’ll typically return to your accommodation before the heat of the day really sets in.Evening Game Drive: Your evening game drive starts when the warm sun is still up, but expect the temperature to drop quickly — especially at sunset. Most evening game drives involve a couple of hours of exploring and end with sundowners (evening drinks at sunset) and snacks before heading back.You’ll definitely want to have layers for your evening drive as it can get pretty chilly with the wind.Read More: Top Things to Look for When Choosing a Safari LodgeHow to Choose an African Safari (That’s Right for You)Luggage Requirements and Baggage AllowanceTriple check your luggage requirements and baggage allowance if you have to take a bush flight. When traveling from Nairobi to the Maasai Mara, my flight with Safari Link had some pretty strict requirements.Unfortunately, they only allowed 15 kgs / 33 lbs inclusive of hand luggage. That meant all of my camera gear and camera bag (zoom lenses, cameras, etc.), my purse, toiletries, and clothes all had to weigh less than what I’d normally pack in a carry-on.I ended up having to leave behind a ton of clothes and even my tripod. It was a HUGE bummer but they are very strict with their policies. Fortunately, they offered free luggage storage. But, if you are connecting in multiple airports and not returning to your original airport, you’ll need to take everything with you.You also might not be allowed to use a hard suitcase if they require “soft” suitcases. That means you’ll need to use a soft bag, like a duffel bag.I always travel with this wheeled duffel bag that collapses easily!My advice, again, is to triple check your airline luggage requirements, pack LIGHT and use a soft duffel bag.What to Pack for an African SafariKeep in mind neutral, earth tones for your safari wardrobe! Dark colors will attract heat, and make sure to avoid blue or black clothing as they attract tsetse flies (if you’re in an area with them). !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?

Sun Hat // You’ll definitely need a wide-brim hat to protect you from the rays. Pack 1 or 2 just to be safe, and make sure they aren’t thick material that will make you sweat!2. Light Scarf // I pack a scarf on every trip but you’ll want one on safaris. Not only will it keep you warm on the sunrise and sunset game drives, but it can also be used to keep the dust out of your face.3. Sunglasses // Protect your eyes, and keep some dust out of them while you’re at it.4. Socks & Underwear // Trust me on this, bring a LOT of socks and undies. You get pretty dirty while on the game drives and you’ll want to keep changing to feel fresh.Helpful Tip: You’ll also want to bring along gloves for warmth and earplugs for the nighttime noises. *cue hippo snoring*5. ONA Camera Bag // I typically travel with the ONA Camps Bay backpack, since it can fit all of my gear, however, since I had to pack lighter for the safari, a bag like the ONA Prince Street Messenger was an awesome choice. It’s made of high quality, sturdy materials, and it can fit all of my camera gear, my drone, and my laptop. !function(d,s,id){                        var e, p = /^http:/.test(d.location) ?
